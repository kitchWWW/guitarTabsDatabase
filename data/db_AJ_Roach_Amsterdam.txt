[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]		            [ch]Em[/ch]
In the Port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]			    [ch]Em[/ch]
Of the dreams that he brings from a wide-open sea[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]				[ch]Em[/ch]
And in the Port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]	  [ch]Em[/ch]	         [ch]Am[/ch]
as the river bank weeps with the old willow tree[/tab]


[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]				 [ch]G[/ch]
And in the Port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]			   [ch]Em[/ch]
full of beer, full of cries from a drunken town fight[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]				[ch]Em[/ch]
And in the Port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]		[ch]Em[/ch]		 [ch]Am[/ch]
on a hot, muggy morn, 'neath the dawns early light[/tab]


[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]			    [ch]Em[/ch]	
In the Port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]		[ch]Em[/ch]
there's a sailor who eats only fish heads and tails[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]		           [ch]Em[/ch]
He'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]		 [ch]Am[/ch]
That could haul up the sails, that could swallow the moon.[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]			        [ch]G[/ch]
And he'll scream to the cook, with his arms open wide[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]			     [ch]Em[/ch]
Bring me more fish, throw'em down by my side[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]		           [ch]Em[/ch]
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]		    [ch]Em[/ch]		     [ch]Am[/ch]
So he stands up and laughs, and then unzips his fly[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]		          [ch]Em[/ch]
In the Port of Amsterdam, you can watch sailors dance[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]				[ch]Em[/ch]
**Honchos burst in their pants, finding women to punch [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]			       [ch]Em[/ch]
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaked[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]	     [ch]Em[/ch]		    [ch]Am[/ch]
Spending the night with the roar of their joke[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]			      [ch]G[/ch]
And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]		     [ch]Em[/ch]
To the rancid sound of their accordion burst[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]			     [ch]Em[/ch]
And then out in the night with their pride in their pants[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]	      [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
And the sluts after **two underneath the street lamps[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]		            [ch]Em[/ch]
In the Port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who drinks[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]		           [ch]Em[/ch]
And he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]		           [ch]Em[/ch]
And he drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]	    [ch]Em[/ch]	       [ch]Am[/ch]
Who have given themselves to a thousand other men[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]			         [ch]G[/ch]
And they'll trade in their virtue, their goodness all gone[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]			    [ch]Em[/ch]
For a **pilfery of coins, till they just can't go on[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]			   [ch]Em[/ch]
Throws his nose to the sky, and he aims up above[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]	     [ch]Am[/ch]
And then pisses a cry for an unfaithful love[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]	                         [ch]Em[/ch]
In the PORT OF AMSTERDAM, In the PORT OF AMSTERDAM!!![/tab]
[ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]

Open Letter to an ex-Girlfriend
by AJ Roach

Capo on 4th or 7th (the song has various great covers on You Tube, and in my 
opinion, the song is very "flexible" to interpretation...if that makes sense)

*Sorry, Ulitmate Guitar Archive jumbles the chord arrangement when I paste my 
document into their system.  I've tried fixing it, and there's nothing I can do.  
Hopefully, you'll figure out the proper timing for the chord changes.

I don't need you, but could I see you sometime.[/tab]

Well, Heaven bless your reckless heart
The way you lust and fall
Well, I say Heaven's in the bed
If it exists at all

I don't need you, I don't need you
There are other girls, you know and I'll be fine
I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, but could I see you sometime.

Visitors of town, hang round 
at St. John's, the Divine
Speaking in their foreign tongue 
of how you should be mine

I don't need you, I don't need you
There are other girls, you know and I'll be fine
I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, but could I see you sometime.  (x2)

This is another great tab of ALO, I think it's not hard to play, just a lot of barred 
but if you can play barred
it shouldn't be hard to play.
I only put the timing in the beginning of everything because it's much better to time it 
yourself, the precise timing is
very hard to type on a computer so just try to get the feeling.
The chorus is always with chords because I can copy it because the lyrics are the same, 
the end of the chorus I put a
lot of white between the words, it was the only possibility because else I couldn't 
the chords above them. Don't let
yourself mislead by it though, it's played very fast at the end of the last sentence of 
chorus.
Enjoy and rate please!;)


Verse:

[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                                  [ch]B[/ch]
  Things she said been making them feel afraid[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                            [ch]B[/ch]
  That they're gonna be let down[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                                [ch]B[/ch]
  But if they knew what she were capable of[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]
  I know they'd want her around[/tab]

Bridge:

That's why she gotta
G#min
give it
[tab]                [ch]F#[/ch]
A little bit of confidence[/tab]
G#min
And just believe in
[tab]         [ch]F#[/ch]
What she do[/tab]

verse: [ch]F#[/ch], [ch]B[/ch]

I appreciate her modesty
It's positive I know it's true
But when her modesty is talking negatively
Everybody feels negative too

Bridge: G#min, F#

That's why she gotta give it
A little bit of confidence
And just believe in
What she do

Chorus:
[tab]          [ch]F#[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]
We got to try just a little bit harder[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F#[/ch]                  [ch]C#[/ch]
And let it shine just a little bit brighter[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F#[/ch]                     [ch]B[/ch]
We got to walk just a little bit taller[/tab]
             G#min   A#min  F#min          G#min    A#min  F#min
'Cause I can feel    the    sound and it's bringing me     down

Verse: [ch]F#[/ch], [ch]B[/ch]

Ain't nobody want you preaching to them
So we probably shouldn't be talking this way
It's so hard to communicate these things
I know these things are even harder to change

Chorus:
[tab]          [ch]F#[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]
We got to try just a little bit harder[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F#[/ch]                  [ch]C#[/ch]
And let it shine just a little bit brighter[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F#[/ch]                     [ch]B[/ch]
We got to walk just a little bit taller[/tab]

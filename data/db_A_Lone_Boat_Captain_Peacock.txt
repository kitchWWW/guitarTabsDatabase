[Bridge 1]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
In the dead of night in winter[/tab]

[Bridge 2]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]E7[/ch]
Someday you might yell as loud as I did[/tab]

[Pre-chorus]

So while we can still have fun[/tab]

And until we're on the run[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
And live by the gun[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
In the light of the double sun[/tab]

[Chorus 3]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
We'll yell as loud as we did[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]G/G#[/ch]
And we'll fucking like it[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
We'll yell as loud as we did[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]G/G#[/ch]
And we'll fucking like it[/tab]

[tab]VERSE 2:same as the first([ch]B[/ch] and [ch]F#[/ch])
And now I know, that i have made big plans,[/tab]
and i have said big things that i have pulled out of my head
that these sins are kept a lot,
and have been kept it all
now a handful is all thats left
can you just look at how things were, and how they are now, and please just tell
me that i am right
just tell me why its so hard for you to be wrong 
for once in your life

She likes the taste of Captain Morgan[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Cigarettes, oh she adores them[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]             [ch]C#m[/ch] - [ch]A[/ch]
She can get a little crazy sometimes[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
Tight shirts and mini skirts[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Her family's rich so she'll never work[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]C#m[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
And she's always on my mind[/tab]
Woah-oh

[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
I can see the love when I look into her eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
If everyone could see what I see inside[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]B[/ch]
But she lives at night and sleeps all day[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
She'll dance and drink her life away[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]        [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]C#m[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
But she doesn't know who I am[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]B[/ch]
She gets what she wants and doesn't quit[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C#m[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
She might as well get paid for it[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]       [ch]C#m[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
But she doesn't know who I am, and she doesn't give a damn.[/tab]

(Same as verse 1)
She doesn't kiss under rain clouds, Only boys in the same crowd
Guess I'm outta luck now
Is it because of my long hair, tattoos, and the fact that I don't care what she thinks 
me, and that drives her crazy.

I can see the love when I look into her eyes
If everyone could see what I see inside
But she lives at night and sleeps all day
She'll dance and drink her life away
But she doesn't know who I am
She gets what she wants and doesn't quit
She might as well get paid for it
But she doesn't know who I am, and she doesn't give a damn.

[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Someday she'll know that she loves me[/tab]
That she loves me
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Someday she'll know that she loves me[/tab]
That she loves me

[tab][ch]E[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]             [ch]C#m[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
When she's alone I can't write about her[/tab]
When she's alone I can't... Hm..

But she lives at night and sleeps all day
She'll dance and drink her life away
But she doesn't know who I am
She gets what she wants and doesn't quit
She might as well get paid for it
But she doesn't know who I am, and she doesn't give damn.

But someday she'll know who I am
Then maybe she'll give a damn

Artist: Aaron Lewis
Song: Anywhere But Here
Genre: 
Key: 


Listen to the song for exact timing, but I will try my best to explain.
Play the deeper strings for one hit and a small pause and strum the higher
strings four times. Repeat this 4 times for each chord apart from the Em and D
which are only played twice each.

Repeat this throughout the entire song.

This road is going nowhere
And these... these shoes are worn too thin
There's always should'ves where I'm going
There's always could'ves where I've been

Anywhere but here
I wish I was
Anywhere but here

There's always footsteps from behind me
But don't they ever read the writing on the wall
All this time I've spent rewinding
Might meen nothing
It might meen nothing at all

I wish I was
Anywhere but here
Just too be
Anywhere but here

The bed next to me is empty
Just like this shell I've been trying to fill
The things put in life to tempt me
They can't ever
They won't break my world

I wish I was
Anywhere but here
Just too be
Anywhere but here
I wish I was
Anywhere but here
Just too be
Anywhere but here

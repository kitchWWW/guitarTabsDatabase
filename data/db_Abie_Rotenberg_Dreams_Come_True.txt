[Verse 1]
[tab]       [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
Let me tell a tale, I beg you all to listen,[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G#m[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]
I think you’ll recognize that every word is true.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]
It’s the story that I tell about my brother,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G#m[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
The brother that I loved but hardly knew.[/tab]

[Verse 2]

[tab]        [ch]B[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
We were forced to live so far from one another,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G#m[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
But it was more than distance keeping him from me.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]B[/ch]
While I had the right to lead the life I’d chosen,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G#m[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
All he yearned for was the day that he’d be free.[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]F#[/ch]
How I dreamed that one day we could be together,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]B[/ch]
  Doing all the things that brothers do.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]G#m[/ch]
But I feared that I would have to dream forever,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]B[/ch]
For only dreamers still believe that dreams come true.[/tab]

[Verse 3]

[tab]  [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]
I fought with all my strength to gain his freedom,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G#m[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
And challenged those who dared keep us apart.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]
I pleaded for compassion, “he’s my brother,”[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G#m[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
But there’s no mercy when the soul is cold and dark.[/tab]

[Verse 4]

[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]
The years and decades followed one another,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
And I worried what they must have done to him.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
Though the flame that made us brothers was still burning,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G#m[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
I knew that tiny spark was growing dim.[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]F#[/ch]
How I dreamed that one day we could be together,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]B[/ch]
  Doing all the things that brothers do.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]G#m[/ch]
But I feared that I would have to dream forever,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]B[/ch]
For only dreamers still believe that dreams come true.[/tab]

[Verse 5]

[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]
But He who rules the world heard our prayers,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
How I wept the day they set my brother free.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]B[/ch]
And I wondered, would he find faith with his freedom,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]
In my heart I knew that it was up to me.[/tab]

[Verse 6]

[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]B[/ch]
Oh I realized the first time that I embraced him,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G#m[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]
He’s a stranger who feels awkward and alone.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
But I have just what it takes to make him welcome,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G#m[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
A brother’s love to make him feel at home.[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]F#[/ch]
How I dreamed that one day we could be together,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]B[/ch]
  Doing all the things that brothers do.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]G#m[/ch]
But I feared that I would have to dream forever,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]B[/ch]
For only dreamers still believe that dreams come true.[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]G#m[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]F#[/ch]
How I dreamed that one day we could be together,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]B[/ch]
  Doing all the things that brothers do,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]G#m[/ch]
Now that day has come and it will last forever.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]F#[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
For I know and I believe, yes I know and I believe,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]B[/ch]
I’m a dreamer who believes that dreams come true.[/tab]

[Intro]
 [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]
You were despised and rejected.[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
A man of sorrows, acquainted with grief.[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
Though you were sinless and holy,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
You bore it all because of me.[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
You were wounded for my transgressions,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Bruised for my iniquities.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]
You were worthy of all adoration.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
But you took my shame, and gave me peace.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause He didn't turn away from the burden I carried,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
He didn't run from me, or from the load I was bearing,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
He came willingly, and gave His life for me,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
And took my stripes, that I might go free.[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
Sometimes I am asked to carry burdens,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
To suffer pain from what others do and say.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
Inside I am running from their problems,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
To find my peace in getting far away.[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
'Til I remember that one day upon a rugged cross,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Jesus bore the pain I fashioned with my sin.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
He laid down His life without a word.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
And now I begin to see how I can be like Him.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause He didn't turn away from the burden I carried,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
He didn't run from me, or from the load I was bearing,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
He came willingly, and gave His life for me,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
And took my stripes, that I might go free.[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
To love one another, He's commanded us to do,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
He said, "Love your brother, as I have loved you."[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
So I will not turn away from the burden you carry,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
I will not run from you, or from the load you are bearing,[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
He came willingly, Christ came willingly.[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
'And He didn't turn away from the burden I carried,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
He didn't run from me, or from the load I was bearing,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
He came willingly, and gave His life for me,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
And took my stripes, that I might go free.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
O, Lord, use my life, that others may go free.[/tab]

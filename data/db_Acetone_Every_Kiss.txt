[Verse 1]
[tab]                [ch]G#m7[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
If you had your way, would it stay the same?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G#m7[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]
Every single kiss, every single kiss[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]C#m7[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]
And I could be whatever you want me to be[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C#m7[/ch]                      [ch]B[/ch]
And you could be just what I need right now[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C#m7[/ch]
Know that that would be enough[/tab]

That would be enough[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
For now[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]             [ch]G#m7[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]
Every single lie, all the things you've tried[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G#m7[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
They don't mean a single thing to me[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]C#m7[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]
'Cause I would give you everything without 'em[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#m7[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
If you believe what I already know[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]C#m7[/ch]
And all the things that you've hated[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]B[/ch]
And all the people who take too much[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C#m7[/ch]
They just keep persuading[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]E[/ch]
They just keep persuading[/tab]
[ch]C#m7[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]C#m7[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]
[ch]B[/ch]

[tab]           [ch]G#m7[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
They don't mean a single thing to me[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]C#m7[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]

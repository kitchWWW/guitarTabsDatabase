Lyrics


On a trampoline these kids would talk about their lives
two lovers with an educated view on future lies
the plans they made were fair, and no one could change their minds
these lovers with an educated view on future lies
See them running see them running now 
On a trampoline these kids, would kiss and talk all night
too young to know their future dreams would turn to future lies
talk of marriage was common place, for who could break their ties
these lovers with an educated view on future lies
See them running see them running now 
In the grass these kids would lay, just the sky watching them play
two lovers with an educated view on future days
but we know this stories wrong, these two kids they fell away
these lovers with an educated view on future days

lyrics
YOUR ARMS AROUND MY NECK I’M HOLDING U SO TIGHT
AM I DREAMING WILL U WAKE ME IF I’M RIGHT
YOUR LIPS AROUND MY TONGUE AND I AM CALLING
WILL U CATCH ME FALLING THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME

KISSING YOU IN THE DRIVEWAY
KISSING YOU RIGHT THROUGH THE NIGHT
YOURE EVERYTHING I DREAM ABOUT
YOURE EVERYTHING I SCREAM ABOUT
KISSING YOU IN THE DRIVEWAY
KISSING YOU RIGHT THROUGH THE NIGHT
I WANNA BE WITH YOU ALL ALONE
IM STAYIN TILL YOUR DAD COMES HOME
KISSING YOU IN THE DRIVEWAY

TURN OUT THE LIGHT AND HOLD MY HAND
YOURE BREATHING, I STILL THINK I’M DREAMIN
WAKE ME IF I’M RIGHT
YOUR EARS ARE SOFT I WHISPER THAT I LOVE YOU
LET JUST RUN AWAY LETS HIDE AND RUN AWAY

KISSING YOU IN THE DRIVEWAY
KISSING YOU RIGHT THROUGH THE NIGHT
YOURE EVERYTHING I DREAM ABOUT
YOURE EVERYTHING I SCREAM ABOUT
KISSING YOU IN THE DRIVEWAY
KISSING YOU RIGHT THROUGH THE NIGHT
I WANNA BE WITH YOU ALL ALONE
IM STAYIN TILL YOUR DAD COMES HOME
KISSING YOU IN THE DRIVEWAY

DO YOU WONDER,
IF IN 20 YEARS THIS SONG WILL EVEN COUNT
WILL YOU REMEMBER KISSING ME UNDER THE STARS
WILL YOU LOOK BACK, DIG UP A PHOTOGRAPH AND HIDE INSIDE YOUR ROOM
AND THINK ABOUT THE SIMPLE TIMES

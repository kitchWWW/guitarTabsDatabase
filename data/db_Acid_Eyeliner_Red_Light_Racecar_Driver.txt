Lyrics

Run away with me, lets hit the road at midnight
and never turn around,
Stay with me, every minute feeling closer
as we’re shooting out of town
On this road that goes forever 
with this love we have together
who’s gonna slow us down
who’s gonna slow us down 
Cause I’m a Red Light Racecar Driver
and I’m trying to remind you
that your life is on the edge
you gotta hold on tight 
with a pistol in my pocket
and my little red rocket
pushing my life right to the edge
you gotta hold on tight
Live your life with me, lets hit the road together
no one can slow us down
stay with me, every minute feeling closer
as we’re shooting out of town
Chorus
Who’s gonna slow us down!

[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Would you watch the light fade out,[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Just to excite the dark?[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Bm[/ch]
Cause I’ve been feeling so worn down,[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]
And it’s taking a toll on my heart.[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
And everyone’s worried about me,[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Am I worried about myself?[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
Am I worried about what I’m gunna be,[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Am I worried about everyone else?[/tab]


[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Cause I’m just waiting patiently, darling.[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]
I’m just singing at the trees and starlings.[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Bm[/ch]
All I want to do is dance with you darling.[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Away from all of their hands and harming.[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]D[/ch]
I’m just waiting there for you.[/tab]

[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
The sun is going to burn out one day,[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Going to leave us in the winter one day.[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
Gunna leave us in the cold, build the ice caps up of old.[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
We’ll lose the sun that warms our aging skin.[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
I heard it on the news,[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Heard worries on the radio.[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Bm[/ch]
I’ve heard stories of the end of the world.[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
And where we’re gunna go.[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
I’m so damn scared of dying.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
So god damn week from trying to block it out.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]

[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Giving love and admiring everything I’ve cared about.[/tab]

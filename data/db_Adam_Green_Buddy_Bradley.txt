Buddy Bradley: [ch]Am[/ch], [ch]G[/ch], [ch]C[/ch]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
This is not a good day to call me[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Because I cannot spare some sympathy[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
My own feeling is mostly unclear[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
And when I’m talking to you I’m not here[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]
I don’t think I’ll ever be ready for you[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
But I’ll be trying to help you out too[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]
So I went downstairs for a walk[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
But I had no strength to not taaaalk[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
Yes, you were the flatulent one[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
And I am the boar who has a gun[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]
You ran into me with such force[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Now all I can be is Buddy Bradley[/tab]

And all of her friends have been approved by them

And all I can hear is people singing

Now two of a kind has come across my mind

Where forever more is painted on her door

Just cancel the sun it’s so ????

And bury the gravedigger’s son

No money can last for too long

Nobody could pay for this soooong

And all of her friends have been approved by them

And all I can hear is people singing

Now two of a kind has come across my mind

Where forever more is painted on her door

Yes, you were the flatulent one

And I am the boar who has a gun

You ran into me with such force

Now all I can be is Buddy Bradley


Just listen to this song for the strumming pattern.

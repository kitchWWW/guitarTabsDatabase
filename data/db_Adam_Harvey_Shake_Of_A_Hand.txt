[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Today Granddad came by the office[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]C[/ch]
Amazed at all the papers that I sign[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I told him that's how we do business[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
I'm just a product of the modern times[/tab]

He shook his head and then said
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
I don't understand how all these deals are done[/tab]

It just don't make no sense to me
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
To deal with people you don't see[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]Dsus[/ch]
We did it so much differently when I was young[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
When the shake of a hand[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Was all you really needed[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]Dsus[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
The strength of a man was in his words[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
When you could look him in the eye[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
And know just where you stand[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Men were made on the shake of a hand[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Well I put down my pen down and closed up early[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]C[/ch]
We drank a beer and talked of times he's had[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He reminisced when he proposed to Nanna[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
And how he got permission from her dad[/tab]

He smiled and said I won't forget
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
The hardest hand I ever had to shake[/tab]

I told him I'd take care of her
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And through the years I kept my word[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]Dsus[/ch]
Son we said just what we meant back in those days[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
When the shake of a hand[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Was all you really needed[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]Dsus[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
The strength of a man was in his words[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
When you could look him in the eye[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
And know just where you stand[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Men were made on the shake of a hand[/tab]

G             Em7
She's in love but she doesn't know
Cadd9             D
What she needs or how to let go
G          Em7
Feels like being married
Cadd9             D
She was too young to miscarry

She says
G          Cadd9
Bye bye my childhood dream man
Em7            Cadd9
I will keep in touch if I can
A7sus4                  Cadd9
Spent the best years of my life with you

G
Happens every time
Em7
You start to lose yourself
Cadd9
You turn to blame the one
D
That loves you the most
G
to stay and work it out
Em7
is harder than to run away
Cadd9
so she leaves a note
D
because to his face she couldn't say

G          Cadd9
Bye bye my childhood dream man
Em7            Cadd9
I will keep in touch if I can
A7sus4               Cadd9           G
Spent the best years of my life with you

Bm   C         A    Asus    A
Hold on if you can
C    D     Dsus4    D
Hold on

G             Em7
So all things fade away in time
Cadd9
But what was once so bright
D
Somehow no longer shines
G
Caught the pain at last
Em7
Thought he was the one
Cadd9
Thought she had the strength
D
to hold on

G          Cadd9
Bye bye my childhood dream man
Em7            Cadd9
I will keep in touch if I can
A7sus4               Cadd9           G
Spent the best years of my life with you

G          Cadd9
Bye bye my teenage angel
Em7                  Cadd9
I don't know how the spell was broken
A7sus4                Cadd9                G
I don't know what I'm doing, but I'll miss you
A7sus4                Cadd9                G
I don't know what I'm doing, but I'll miss you
A7sus4                Cadd9                G
I don't know what I'm doing, but I'll miss you

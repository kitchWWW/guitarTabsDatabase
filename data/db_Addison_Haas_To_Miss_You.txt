[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  Sometimes I wonder, when I look up to the sky[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Do you see the tears falling from my eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  At times I wonder if you know it's killing me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
That my friend for life was gone so suddenly[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And I wonder if you know what it's like to miss you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And I wonder if you know what it's like to miss you[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  I try to move along and live another day[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
But the memories always get in the way[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  You were the only one who knew me like I do[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
But without the bad, that's what I loved about you[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And I wonder if you know what it's like to miss you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And I wonder if you know what it's like to miss you[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  My voice of reason that guided me along[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
You always had my back, even times when I was wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  Where are you now, my friend, when I'm in my time of need[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
I could sure use advice 'cause yours I'd always heed[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And I wonder if you know what it's like to miss you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And I wonder if you know what it's like to miss you[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
  And when I think of how I took you for granted[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
  As so many often do[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
  I wish I could tell you how sorry I am[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
  That I wasn't a better friend to you[/tab]


[Riff]
[tab]                                                        [ch]G[/ch]
(Yeah, hey homes, uh, this ain't working out, as far as talking right now)[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]G[/ch]
(I guess, or cutting out, and everything, if later on you get to a good spot, and you wanna talk)[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
(That'd be great, if not,   maybe I'll just see you in the morning)[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
(Thanks for being around, man.  Bye)[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  I play your old guitar, it's like you're by my side[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
But it's not the same, a fact I cannot hide[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  You used to help me so, to find the perfect words[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
But without you here it just seems so absurd[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And I wonder if you know what it's like to miss you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And I wonder if you know what it's like to miss you[/tab]

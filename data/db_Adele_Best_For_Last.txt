[tab][ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
Wait, do you see[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]      
My heart on my sleeve?[/tab]

It's been there
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
For days on end and[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
It's been waiting for you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
To open up[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Just you baby, come on now[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm trying to tell you just how[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
I'd like to hear the words[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
Roll out of your mouth finally[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Say that it's always been me[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
That's made you feel a way[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
You've never felt before[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
And I'm all you need[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
And that you never want more[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]
Then you'd say all[/tab]

Of the right things
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
Without a clue[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But you'd save[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
The best for last[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Like I'm the one for you[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
You should know[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
That you're just a temporary fix[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
This is not rooted with you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
It don't mean that much to me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]
You're just a filler in the space[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
That happened to be free[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
How dare you think[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
You'd get away[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
With trying to play me[/tab]



Keep: [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] ...

Why is it everytime
I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
Cause you're still
Not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do
To make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances
And getting away
And though I'm trying
My hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know
Things may never change
I'm still hoping one day
I might hear you say

I make you feel a way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
Then you'd say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
But you'd save
The best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know
That you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you
It don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space
That happened to be free
How dare you think
You'd get away
With trying to play me

But, despite
The truth that I know
I find it hard to let go
And give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me
The more eager I am
To persist
With this heartbreak
And running around
And I think that I know
Things may never change
I'm still hoping one day
I might hear you say

I make you feel a way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
And we'll say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
And you'll be the one for me
And me the one for you

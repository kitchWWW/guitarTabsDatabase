From all the boys, yeah the girls they know that stare[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
Just started 9th grade, yeah way back when[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
I felt my phone buzz but he was no Ken[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
I just felt loved, so I didn’t really have a care[/tab]

Went to hoco, got a snowcone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Funny I had to pay for mine[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
I’m not spoiled, but I was told[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
That a man should treat me right[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You said not to write a song about you, about you, about you[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
So I write a few songs about you, about you, about you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                                      [ch]F[/ch]
There’s so much I have to share, but to you I swear[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                                            [ch]G[/ch]
By all the girls, but I didn’t really know back then[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
You were known for what you're known for[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
Getting girls I was told you kept a score[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
In a book, but I was just happy you read[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
When I found out, without a doubt[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
That you’d never treat me right[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Shoulda ran fast, never look back[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Coulda done it that very same night[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You said not to write a song about you, about you, about you[/tab]

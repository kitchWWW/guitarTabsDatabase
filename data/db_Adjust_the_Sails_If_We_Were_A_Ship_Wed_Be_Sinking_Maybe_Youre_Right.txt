[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]F#m[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
7 am we roll out of bed, brew coffee you put up your hair[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]F#m[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Work from the den, then in bed by ten, and cycle it over again[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
It's funny how you can share so much but feel so far away[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]F#m[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Watching tv in silence the tension grows violent, pushing and pulling away[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
Tell me I'm wrong, I'll tell you you're right[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]F#m[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Just to end this conversation, I just can't do this tonight[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]F#m[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
You say we need to work on communication, maybe you're right[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]F#m[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
   Maybe you're right[/tab]

I don't even know what we're fighting about, was it the way I tuned out[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]F#m[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]F#m[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
Don't yell at me, you know I can't take it, I'm doing my best, yeah I'll fake it til I make it[/tab]

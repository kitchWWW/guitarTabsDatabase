[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]
Got to write a classic[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C#m[/ch]
Got to write it in an attic[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
Babe, I'm an addict now[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]    [ch]E7sus[/ch]
An addict for your love[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
I was a stray boy[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C#m[/ch]
And you was my best toy[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
Found it easy to annoy you[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Bm[/ch]
But you were different from the rest[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]
And I loved you all the wrong ways[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C#m[/ch]
Now listen to me say[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
If it changed to another way[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Bm[/ch]
Would the difference make it[/tab]

Would it be a classic
[tab]                      [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]E7(sus)[/ch]
I gotta send it right away[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]
Got to write a classic (so down, and I'm out of control without you)[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C#m[/ch]
Got to write it in an attic (my heart can't flow, there's no living without you)[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
Baby, I'm an addict now (deep down I know, you're not hearing a word I say)[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]    [ch]E7(sus)[/ch]
An addict for your love (gotta write it down, and send it right away)[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]           [ch]F#m7[/ch]     
Now I'm living my life[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
One day at a time[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]GM7[/ch]
Since losing your love[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]F#m7[/ch]
I've been losing my mind[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C#m[/ch]
What more can I see[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]E7sus[/ch]
The future so clear[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F#sus[/ch]
And it's not what I mean[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A7(sus)[/ch]
I mean it's not what it seems[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]E7sus[/ch]
I just keep living for dreams[/tab]

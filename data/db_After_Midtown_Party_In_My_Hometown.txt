VERSE:
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
Been a year full of Friday nights yeah[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
Been steering clear, ran outta beer under them neon lights[/tab]

[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Can't risk the running bumping in to her[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Those memories of what used to be[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
Baby everything yeah it still hurts[/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
In case you wanna know[/tab]


CHORUS:
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
She's the reason why I kick it by the county line[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
Far away from her smile and the street lights[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm7[/ch]
Can't stand to see the girl that used to be[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
My drunk, caught another kiss, don't think I can handle this[/tab]

[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
She's the reason why I keep it on the low down[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
Why my buddies they ain't blowing up my phone now[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm7[/ch]                                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
 I keep these tirs on the road to see the roll around[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                                           [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
She's the reason I don't party in my hometown[/tab]

(She's the reason I don't party in my hometown)


VERSE:
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
I bet she's sitting in a booth in the corner[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
In the dark someone elses heart,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Someone elses arms wrapped all around her[/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
But I don't see her face[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
This many miles away[/tab]

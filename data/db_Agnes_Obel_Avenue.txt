[tab][ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
What is wrong at the end of the day[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
What is really wrong no one dares to say[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]
You know you're wrong when there's only one right[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
but what is wrong when right is out of sight[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
Right rode away long ago[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
Before rescuing wrong from below[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]
I might be mistaken I know[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
But hey we need to be somewhat[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]
Foolish, feebleminded, wrong and senseless[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]              
Right rode off long ago,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         
there's nothing more you need to know[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
there's nothing more you need to show[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]                                     [ch]Am[/ch]
Let's disagree, cause wrong was made for you to be[/tab]

[ch]Am[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] x4

What is false when we can't hear no more
And there is nothing to cover for
What is wrong in this old wasted game
May right and wrong be one and the same

Right rode away long ago
Before rescuing wrong from below
I might be mistaken I know
but hey we need to be somewhat

Foolish, feebleminded, wrong and senseless
Right rode off long ago,
there's nothing more you need to know
there's nothing more you need to show
Let's disagree, cause wrong was made for you to be

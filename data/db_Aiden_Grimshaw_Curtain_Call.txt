Curtain calls, there’s no more alcohol[/tab]
As the rain begins you feel it soaking into your bones
Don’t let time be wasted

Let your heart dictate this
Take my hand and follow me
Lose control with me tonight

Give me all your love please
Give me all your love please, please
Hey, give me all your love please yeah
I said give me all your love please, please

Silence stares big leap
I am unprepared,
But I’m fighting it
We ignite in this once more
Burning bright sensation there’s no medication
But that we could recreate, this world we make ‘cuz it’s ours

And you say all my love
You know I’ve come to bring you peace

Give me all your love please
Give me all your love
Give me all your love please
Oh, all I need is all your love,
Give me all your love please, please
Give me all your love
Give me all your love please
Oh, all I need is all your love,
And all I need is all your love, is all your love
Is all your love

Oh my love, you know I’ve come to bring you peace
You’ll be saying ooh my love
You know I’ve come to bring you &#7767;eace
I need your lovin’ all day baby
I need your lovin’ all night
I’ll keep you on, and I’ll hold you tight

I need your lovin’ all night
I need your lovin’ all day
Said only can need the words I mean t say

Give me all your love please
Give me all your love
Give me all your love please
Oh, all I need is all your love
Give me all your love please
And all I need is all your love, is all your love
Is all your love

Curtain calls, there’s no more alcohol
As the rain begins you feel it soaking in

Artist: Akon
Song: Angel
Genre: 
Key: 


Akon - Angel

It seems that the right chords are a combination between the other two versions plus
some extra details. The bass line is the key, so maybe you would like to play it plucking
the chords with index, middle and ring fingers on the first three strings, and the 
basses with the thumb so the bass line can be heard clearly. The same chords for all of the song
with a little variation in certain parts that does not correspond exactly to the verse 
and chorus. I don't really understand why, but I listened carefully and I think I'm right.

I also heard a version wich is a semitone up, so you would need a capo on the first fret.

Part A:   [ch]D[/ch], [ch]F#m[/ch]/[ch]C#[/ch], [ch]Bm[/ch], [ch]D/A[/ch]

I'm looking at an angel[/tab]
And believe me when I say
She got that whole place blowing
She got that whole place blowing
She got that whole place glowing
I'm looking at an angel
And believe me when I say
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
And she's high in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing

She got wings she got a halo[/tab]
It seems to me so unnatural
Cos that's one thing that I just don't know
What seems to be so incredible
She looked at me took me by surprise yeaaahh
As if she took me by the hand to some foreign land
And had me way up
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Way above the clouds in the sky singing

[tab][ch]A[/ch]:
Singing my song (yeah yeah),[/tab]
from dusk till dawn (yeah yeah)
I know you got a lot on your mind
but it won't be long (yeah yeah)
If all things get better (yeah yeah),
and I may be wrong (yeah yeah)
Cause I'll never get to even cross
the line before they make it home (yeah yeah)

She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
And she's high in the sky singing

Nobody wanna see us together[/tab]
Nobody thought we'd last forever
I feel I'm hopin' and prayin'
Things between us don't get better
Men steady comin' after you
Women steady comin' after me
Seem like everybody wanna go for self
And don't wanna respect boundaries
Tellin' you all those lies
Just to get on your side
But I must admit there was a couple secrets
I held inside
But just know that I tried
To always apologize
And I'ma have you first always in my heart
To keep you satisfied

[tab](DO Chords Pattern [ch]A[/ch]-[ch]E[/ch]-[ch]F#m[/ch]-D)
Got every right to wanna leave[/tab]
Got every right to wanna go
Got every right to hit the road
And never talk to me no more
You don't even have to call
Even check for me at all
Because the way I been actin' lately
Has been off the wall
Especially toward you
Puttin' girls before you                           
And they watchin' everything I been doin'
Just to hurt you
Most of it just ain't you
Ain't true
And they won't show you
How much of a queen you are to me
And why I love you baby
(repeat chorus)

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no

Cause we gon' fight
Oh yes we gon' fight
Believe we gon' fight        
We gon' fight             
Fight for our right to love yeah

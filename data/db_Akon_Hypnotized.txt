Artist: Akon
Song: Hypnotized
Genre: 
Key: 


This song isn't the greatest thing I've ever heard on the radio. But it has a damn 
guitar riff!! And since no one tabbed it out yet, I figure I'd save everyone the (slight bit) 
trouble trying to learn it by ear.

Enjoy!

* I don't usually play this part at the end: [--h10-13-//15-p13-] in order to keep the 
going better. But it's definitely in the song if you listen closely!

*Also remember to use your thumb to play the bass notes on the low E string and to let 
ring out as much as possible! -- Just listen to the song if you're having problems with 
timing. ;]

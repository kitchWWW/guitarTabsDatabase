Well I've got a heart worth breaking[/tab]

[Verse 2]
It's true, nothing lasts forever
But can we see this one thing through?
In a world full of tired eyes
You're still bright and true

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Let caution do it's sleeping[/tab]

'Cause hearts are bound to break[/tab]

[Verse 3]
All the burning questions
That complicate the mind
It's the infinite connections
That get us every time

[Verse 4]
And it's true that nothing's perfect
And you're miracle enough
Your heart's still warm and tender
While most have gotten tough

[Pre-Chorus]
Let caution do it's sleeping
And hearts are bound to break

[Chorus]

Yeah, we'll love while love's awake[/tab]

[Verse 5]
Tonight's a chance worth taking
If only for a while
And if you keep your eyes wide open
You just might be surprised

[Verse 6]
It's true that nothing's certain
But I'm willing to bet
Somewhere behind the curtains
There's a night we won't soon forget

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll let caution do it's sleeping
And hearts are bound to break

[Chorus]
And we'll love while love's awake
Yeah, we'll love while love's awake

Before the morning's break-in[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Before prudence makes us part[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Let the warnings be forsaken[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
For a matter of the heart[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
And we'll let caution do it's sleeping
And hearts are bound to break

[Chorus]
And we'll love while love's awake
Yeah, we'll love while love's awake
And we'll love while love's awake
Yeah, we'll love while love's awake

[Verse 1]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]      
A stupid me, I took a morning picture[/tab]
[tab]([ch]C[/ch])                 [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]   
To send to you ten thousand miles away[/tab]
[tab]([ch]C[/ch])            [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
The yolky sun rising on the snowfield[/tab]

And I swore I wouldn't think of you today[/tab]

[Verse 2]
The frozen line takes me across the border
A hundred years of horses lead the way
Why do stubborn leaves turn forever colder?
There's nothing left to cling to anyway

[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
I know you'll break my heart again[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Somewhere on the northern plains[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
Tired lovers left alone to lie[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
Far beyond the golden grave[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
An emptiness I can't explain[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]
Our hearts are always broken in the sky[/tab]
(N.C.)
As the northern plains go by

[Instrumental]
[ch]C[/ch], [ch]F[/ch] (x2)

[Verse 3]
Holding on to ghosts gets you nowhere
You'll burn, forgetting quietly each day
I've never seen so far without an ocean
And I've never longed for something more to say

[Chorus]
I know you'll break my heart again
Somewhere on the northern plains
Tired lovers left alone to lie
Far beyond the golden grave
An emptiness I can't explain
Our hearts are always broken in the sky
[tab]                          [ch]F[/ch]
As the northern plains go by[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]([ch]F[/ch])
I don't know where the moments go[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
Or if love can be replaced[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
And I don't know why the morning snow[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]
Reminds me of your face[/tab]

[Chorus]
But I know you'll break my heart again
Somewhere on the northern plains
Tired lovers left alone to lie
Far beyond the golden grave
An emptiness I can't explain
Our hearts are always broken in the sky
As the northern plains go by
As the northern plains go by
As the northern plains go by

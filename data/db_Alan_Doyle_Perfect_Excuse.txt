[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I've seen your kind before[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Asus2[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
Defender of the crown[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Asus2[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
You've got your shades of swagger on[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Asus2[/ch]   [ch]Bsus4[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
Every time you come around[/tab]

[Verse 2]
Got your motives on your mind
Your worries, far and few
A car crash, or a carnival
Well, it's all the same to you

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Asus2[/ch]
You're chasing like[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]
Some holy grail[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Asus2[/ch]
A far from grace[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
But never fails, when[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]([ch]E[/ch])         [ch]Asus2[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
You give me something I can use[/tab]
[tab][ch]Asus2[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]Bsus4[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]
I     need the perfect excuse[/tab]
[tab]([ch]E[/ch])                            [ch]Asus2[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]
You're an offer on the table I just can't refuse[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Asus2[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]Bsus4[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]Asus2[/ch]   [ch]Bsus4[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch] (x2)
You're all I need, you're the perfect excuse[/tab]

[Verse 3]
And the ice beneath is is paper thin
I can hear it boom and crack
Take one more step down this greasy slope
And there'll be no turning back

[Verse 4]
I don't have no sober second thought
To stop what you've begun
There's no saving me tonight
There's no saving anyone

[Pre-Chorus]
So, push the button
Start me up
Spin the wheel
Now try your luck and

[Chorus]
You give me something I can use
I need the perfect excuse
You're an offer on the table I just can't refuse
You're all I need, you're the perfect excuse

And my defense is running down[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]       [ch]Asus2[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch], [ch]Asus2[/ch], [ch]Bsus4[/ch], [ch]A[/ch]
Arms twisted, hands are bound[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                               [ch]Asus2[/ch]
To hope, line, and sink her are all I can see[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]           [ch]Asus2[/ch]            [ch]Bsus4[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
Doing your worst has got the best of me[/tab]

[Verse 5]
Well, I've been here before
Forgive me for my sins
Coming to in the afternoon
Seeing what the cat dragged in

[Pre-Chorus]
You're chasing like
Some holy grail
A far from grace
But never fails, when
So, push the button
Start me up
Spin the wheel
Now try your luck and

[Chorus]
You give me something I can use
I need the perfect excuse
You're an offer on the table I just can't refuse
You're all I need
You're something I can use
I need the perfect excuse
You're an offer on the table I just can't refuse
You're all I need, you're the perfect excuse
Perfect excuse
You're a perfect excuse
You're a perfect excuse

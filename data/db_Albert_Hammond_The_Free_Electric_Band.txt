IGNORE THE CHORD BOX DIAGRAMS that the website
displays, they are generated automatically from a
generic database and often don't show the best
options for a particular chord progression. Just use
the voicings suggested in the text column numbers

C  = x32010    F   = 133211
C4 = x33010    C/G = 332010
G  = 320033    G7  = 323003 or 320001
               G/B = x20033

* = No chords, tap the beat on the guitar body

The C4 is only implied by the vocal melody,
and is not crucial. On those lines where there's a C4
the bass plays an upward progression of the notes
C, D, E on the end of the bar of C, then back to a G.
So, as another option, you could play all those bars
as below (instead of the C4) as a little walk up
on the 4th string:


C/D = xx0xxx   C/E = xx2xxx

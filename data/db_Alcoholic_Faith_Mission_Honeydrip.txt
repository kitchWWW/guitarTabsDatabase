[ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]

Swallow just a few to numb it
Your mouth is dripping honey now
Cannot fill this void inside me
It's growing like a landfill

Caught 'em in the back
They were holding all the answers
To who I'm running from these days

[tab][ch]G[/ch]  
Caught you in the act[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
You're so devious[/tab]
Went from letting go
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Now you're latching on[/tab]
[tab]                                                           [ch]G[/ch]
Jumping through the hoops that you placed here[/tab]
[tab]                                                 [ch]Em[/ch]
You placed here 'cause you're devious[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Now you're latching on[/tab]

Give and take
My mind won't let me
Maybe I could care less
Draining all the life within me
You always need me tethered

Caught you in the act
You're so devious
Went from letting go
Now you're latching on
Jumping through the hoops that you placed here
You placed here 'cause you're devious
Went from letting go
Now you're latching on
Jumping through the hoops that you placed here

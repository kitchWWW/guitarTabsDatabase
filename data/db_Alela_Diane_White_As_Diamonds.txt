Artist: Alela Diane
Song: White As Diamonds
Genre: 
Key: 


Capo at 1st fret.

The song is built upon 4 Chords: Em G D and A (from the capos perspective :)

In terms of the strum-pattern you'll have to improvise. I suggest to lay your pick aside
and use thumb and indexfinger to mix strumming and picking.

Always pluck the base note of a chord first: empty E, 3rd fret E, empty D and empty A!

Heres a possibility you could try if you want to, at least it gives you a basic idea of 
it COULD look like.
I don't suppose It's what she plays, but thats not the purpose, is it?

This is just picking, no strumming:

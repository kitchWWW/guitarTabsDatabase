Hi everyone. This is the tab for Alex Lloyd's \"Black the sun\" off his debut album. I worked this out when I was playing my classical acoustic at home. It's pretty basic and easy to strum to, here's how it goes:

Intro:  [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]       (x2)

[tab]Verse:  [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
                black the sun[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch] 
                oh no, look at what we done...........[/tab]
                
                     Repeat chords for verse

[tab]Chorus: [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
                dream with me[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
                I hope you will dream with me[/tab]

                     Repeat chords for chorus

[tab]2nd verse:      [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
                      words we speak[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
                      pictures are the only things I keep............[/tab]

                                Repeat chords for 2nd verse

                   
                                Chorus

Bridge: [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
                [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]       (x3)

                                Chorus (repeat)

End with:     I wish you would black the sun,  the sun
                                                                                          (end on D)

        That's it. Well I hope I'm right, I'm only new at this. Can't wait for Alex's new album.

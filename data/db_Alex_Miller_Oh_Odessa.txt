As recorded by Alex Miller

[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
She told me she came from a dry Texas town[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Where legends were made of the ones who got out[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Somewhere west of midland in the middle of nowhere[/tab]
[tab]                                                  [ch]Am7[/ch]
Where even the tumbleweeds don't hang around very long[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
First chance she got she was gone[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Oh Odessa you're messing with my head[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
Tonight I bet ya she's half to L.A.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am7[/ch]
Oh why, did I ever think I could have settled[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Down with that restless dust devil Angel[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Oh Odessa[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Holding to her is like roping the wind[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Part of me thought I could still pull her in[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
She gave me life like the rain in the desert[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
But looking back now I should have known better cause[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
I'm alone in the Lonestar tonight[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Oh Odessa you're messing with my head[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
Tonight I bet ya she's half to L.A.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am7[/ch]
Oh why, did I ever think I could have settled[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Down with that restless dust devil Angel[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Oh Odessa[/tab]


[Pedal Steel Solo]
[ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
She still believes that the dream she's been chasing[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
Is waiting out there in those wide open spaces[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Oh Odessa[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Oh Odessa you're messing with my head[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
Tonight I bet ya she's half to L.A.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Why did I ever think I could have settled[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Down with that restless dust devil Angel[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Oh Odessa[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Oh Odessa you're messing with my head[/tab]


[Outro]

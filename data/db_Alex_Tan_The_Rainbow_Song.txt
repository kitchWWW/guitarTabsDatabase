Red is the colour of  love, the love you give to me[/tab]
Orange is the colour of happiness, the happy kid I want to be
Yellow is the colour of fun, the bright bright colour of the sun
Green is the colour of the leaves swaying in the tree
[tab]   [ch]G7[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
So come and sway with me[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch] 
Fly to the middle of the rainbow[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                    [ch]G7[/ch]
That's where we will go  [/tab]
I will take the lead, you will follow
Follow to the middle of the rainbow
Flap your wings and fly
All across the sky
We will fly so high
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]G7[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
Rainbow, you and I [/tab]
Rainbow, you and I 

Blue is the colour of the sky as far as I can see
Indigo is the colour of the night, the color of mystery
Violet is the colour of the flower, the purple flower  that smells so sweet
These are the colours  of the rainbow
So come & play with me
Come and flap your wings

Lalala

Flap your wings and fly
All across the sky
We will fly so high
Rainbow, you and I 
Rainbow, you and I

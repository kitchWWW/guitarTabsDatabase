[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I pass it in the hallway[/tab]

I stop and reminisce
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
Most times I keep on walking[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]G[/ch]
Can't believe we ended up like this[/tab]

I wonder where you are (and)

How the hell we got so far
[tab]      [ch]Em7[/ch]
From those two kids, that first kiss[/tab]

Leanin' up against a chain link fence

[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
It's probably time to take it down[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]
Don't need it reminding me now[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
That I was happy once[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]Em7[/ch]
Wish that pictured just stop doing what it always does[/tab]

Wish that song wouldn't come on

[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
When my hearts already halfway gone[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Halfway down this leaving road I'm on[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah we were happy once[/tab]

Who we were ain't who we are
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
We had a real good run[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em7[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
But that don't mean I need to be staying up all night[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Cm[/ch]
Making myself think twice[/tab]

[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Just cuz I was happy once[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
It was fun until it wasn't[/tab]

Blink and you're twenty-something
[tab] [ch]Em7[/ch]
Laying next to someone you don't recognize[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
And the bills are pilin' up and[/tab]

He hasn't kissed you in a month but

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Every now and then it's love[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
And that's what tears me up, 'cause I was...[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Happy once[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]Em[/ch]
Wish that pictured just stop doing what it always does[/tab]

Wish that song wouldn't come on

[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
When my hearts already halfway gone[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Halfway down this leaving road I'm on[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah we were happy once[/tab]

Who we were ain't who we are
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
We had a real good run[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
But that don't mean I need to be staying up all night[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Cm[/ch]
Making myself think twice[/tab]


Just cuz I was happy


[Break]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
It's clear to me it's over[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C/F#[/ch]
But that girl at 21[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
She's always gonna love you cuz[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
You made her happy once[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]
Happy once[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah I was happy once[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]Em[/ch]
Wish that pictured just stop doing what it always does[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
It's kinda hard to put my finger on it[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
What it was that made him make the call to call it off[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I didn't even wanna believe it[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I kinda thought I'd have a little more time[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
I'd right my wrongs and I'd apologize and we'd be fine[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
But I didn't and it isn't[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And wanna know what really makes this hard?[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em7[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
You're just as sweet as everybody says you are[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
I kinda wanna hate you[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bm7[/ch]
I kinda wanna be you[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Asus4[/ch]
I kinda wish I never had to meet you in this bar[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause now I see what he sees[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Bm7[/ch]
You're everything I can't be[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
I can't pretend I'm over him and seeing you ain't hard[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
I kinda hope it works out for you both[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]D[/ch]
But then again, I kinda don't[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I kinda hate that I love those shoes[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                             [ch]G[/ch]
And how that lipstick is the perfect shade on you[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]A[/ch]
It gets to me that I wanna buy you another drink[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em7[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
But every time his name rolls off your lips[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em7[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
It reminds me you're the reason mine will never be on his[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]N.C.              [ch]D[/ch]

[Bridge]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
I was happier just putting the blame on you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Now you've gone and took that from me too[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]

'Cause now I see what he sees[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Bm7[/ch]
You're everything I can't be[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]

[Intro]
([ch]D[/ch])


[Verse]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
It's hard to say this[/tab]
[tab][ch]D/F#[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
And I'm a little embarrassed[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
But you've been asking where my ring is[/tab]
[tab][ch]D/F#[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
 I guess it's time I be honest[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D/F#[/ch]
I gave it 4 hours drives, fly in for a night[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Sat through couples therapy, tears in my eyes[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D/F#[/ch]
I'd sing his praises on every stage[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
And he just had to mention[/tab]

He hates the attention


[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
I painted pink skies at sunrise[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
To cover all the blue[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Hide the shaking ground and storm clouds[/tab]

So you never knew

[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I drew up excuses and said "that's what love is"[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
But truth is[/tab]

Yeah the truth is

[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
I painted him perfect[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
  I painted him perfect[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]
I had to break it to my parents[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]D/F#[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
And Daddy says we don't do divorces[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]A[/ch]
But they got it once I told them some stories[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]D/F#[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
Do you even remember August 14th?[/tab]

Main stage on the beach

[tab]                      [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
Atlantic city, I was singing he was causing a scene[/tab]
[tab][ch]D/F#[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
I'll keep the rest between him and me[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
I painted pink skies at sunrise[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
To cover all the blue[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Hide the shaking ground and storm clouds[/tab]

So you never knew

[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I drew up excuses and said "that's what love is"[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
But truth is[/tab]

Yeah the truth is

[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
I painted him perfect[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
  I painted him perfect[/tab]


[Break]
[tab]                            [ch]Em[/ch]
You could say I missed some red flags[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D/F#[/ch]
But what it comes down to is[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
I was yellow, he was green[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Gm[/ch]
And all we ever made was blue[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
I painted pink skies at sunrise[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
To cover all the blue[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Hide the shaking ground and storm clouds[/tab]

So you never knew

[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I drew up excuses and said "that's what love is"[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
But that's not what love is[/tab]

N.C.
I shouldn't have to paint


[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
Pink skies at sunrise[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
To cover all the blue (cover all the blue)[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Hide the shaking ground and storm clouds[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]A[/ch]
So you never knew (you never knew)[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I drew up excuses and said "that's what love is"[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
But truth is[/tab]

Yeah the truth is

[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
I painted him perfect[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
  I painted him perfect (I painted him perfect)[/tab]

No no

[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
He didn't deserve it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
  But I painted him perfect[/tab]

I painted him perfect
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
I painted him.[/tab]

[Intro]  
[ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
 I stood on faith, and the corner of ambition[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
 I came here to sink or swim, and to show them all[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
 That they were wrong, and though I never thought I'd make it this far[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
 So the curtains are down, for the moment I was someone[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
 There were those in the wings who waited, who came this way, now they're gone.  [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                                               [ch]D[/ch]
 But there's always someone at home who never forgets who you are.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]Bm[/ch]
 And when I'm down and I'm growin' old, I won't be along no railroad track[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]E7[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
 I won't be bound to a life out in the cold[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
 It's been a steady pace, to keep my steps between these cracks on Broadway[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
 And my  stride in rhythm to the beat of home sweet home.[/tab]


[Break]
[ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]


[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]Bm[/ch]
 And when I'm down and I'm growin' old, I won't be along no railroad track[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]E7[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
 I won't be bound to a life out in the cold[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
 It's been a steady pace, to keep my steps between these cracks on Broadway[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
 And my stride in rhythm to the beat of home sweet Can't go on, I'm on the top[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
 of my better years.  I'm going home.  It's too lonesome on the bottom rung here[/tab]


[Tag]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
 It's been a steady pace, to keep my steps between these cracks on Broadway[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
 And my  stride in rhythm to the beat of home sweet home.[/tab]

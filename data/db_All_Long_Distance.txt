Intro   -   Riff1  -  Riff2

A
Long distance, last good-bye
C#
Can't give it one last try
B              D         Riff2
It's all over, we didn't cry

D
All I know is the world came between us
        A               E
and the love got left behind
   D
No news flash, funeral, half mast flags
       A                 E
On the day that our love died
F#           E
I'd tell you face to face
           D
If I could look you in the eye
B         D                  Riff1
So I just called to say good-bye

A
Did you burn my pictures yet?
C#
Anything to try to forget
B              D                    Riff2
It's all over, all I can do to stay on the line

D
All I know is the world came between us
        A               E
and the love got left behind
   D
No news flash, funeral, half mast flags
       A                 E
On the day that our love died
F#           E
I'd tell you face to face
           D
If I could look you in the eye
B         D                  Riff1
So I just called to say good-bye

E                               F#            D
We both know how hard it is for both of us to try
E                             F#       D
We both know how hot it is in Texas in July
F#              E
So what am I supposed to say?
D
(How's the weather anyway?)
B           D                  Riff1
This time I called to say good-bye

A
Who'd have thought it would end like this?
C#
Without even a good-bye kiss
B         D             Riff1
Noone can say we didn't try

D
The years flew past, we tried to make it last
        A               E
But the love got left behind
   D
No news flash, funeral, half-mast flags
       A                 E
On the day that our love died
F#           E
I'd tell you face to face
           D
If I could look you in the eye
B         D                  Riff2
So I just called to say good-bye

B      D
I just called to say
C#                     F#
There's really nothing left to say, so...
B      D                  Intro -- Riff1 -- Riff2 -- F#
I just called to say good-bye.

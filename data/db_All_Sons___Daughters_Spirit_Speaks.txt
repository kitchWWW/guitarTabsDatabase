Spirit Speaks
All sons and daughter
Key: [ch]C[/ch]
  

[tab][ch]C[/ch], [ch]Am[/ch], [ch]G[/ch], [ch]F[/ch]
Your Spirit speaks[/tab]
It moves in me
And I'm awakened to your love

You're drawing me
On to my knees
And I'm astounded by your love

[tab]( Chorus) [ch]Dm[/ch], [ch]F[/ch], [ch]C[/ch], [ch]G[/ch]
You spoke life into my lungs[/tab]
you are the air I breathe
you are the air I breathe
Still you move inside of me
you are the song I sing
you are the song I sing, Jesus

[tab][ch]C[/ch], [ch]Am[/ch], [ch]G[/ch], [ch]F[/ch]
You cover me[/tab]
With arms that reach
And I'm amazed by your sweet grace

You set me free
And you washed me clean
And I'm forgiven by your grace

(Chorus) [ch]Dm[/ch], [ch]F[/ch], [ch]C[/ch], [ch]G[/ch]

(Bridge) 
With every breath I breathe
With every song I sing
I want to shout it out
Lord I am listening
To every word you speak
I'll go where you will lead
To love the least of these
Is my greatest offering (3x)

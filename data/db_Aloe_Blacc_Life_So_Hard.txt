ALOE BLACC - Life So Hard from the Album "Good Things" (2010)
-----------------------------------

[CHORUS]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Oooohhh[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Dont hate you like cold[/tab]
In the winter like tolls
for this winter's ice froze
from the center of my gall
[ch]Dm[/ch]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Don't you make me wanna scream[/tab]
when you find out that you dream
I really wanna sing
and Life is so hard

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
The key to everything, everybody[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
here in America is the money.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Some say that it's the root of all evil;[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
brings wars and other cells of upheaval.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Leaves family in the streets with nothing to eat; little baby boys and girls no shoes on [/tab]
their feet;
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
all the men who leave home dying in the war zones and the women do it all they own.[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Dm[/ch]
It reminds me of the ghettos right here and the hoods that I see, everywhere that I've [/tab]
been in this country.
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Stop bailing out the banks and give the Franklins to me I guess my piece of the pie [/tab]
ain't free, can you free me.

[CHORUS]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Oooohhh[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Dont hate you like cold[/tab]
In the winter like tolls
for this winter's ice froze
from the center of my gall
[ch]Dm[/ch]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Don't you make me wanna scream[/tab]
when you find out that you dream
I really wanna sing
and Life is so hard

[SOLO] ([ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch])

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
He don't care and she don't care; they both got brand new clothes to wear[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
and they ain't worry cuz they don't know what its like to be left out in the snow.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
The dirt - the filth - the gutter - the grime - the pain - the strain - the hustle - the climb[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
the struggle to fight - the conflict - the crime - I don't buy that line that it's [/tab]
nature's design
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
you different, you ugly, you evil, you wrong, you stupid, you dumb, your mind ain't too strong[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]
your daddy ain't from here so you don't belong and the list goes on and on and on and on....[/tab]

[CHORUS]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Oooohhh[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Dont hate you like cold[/tab]
In the winter like tolls
for this winter's ice froze
from the center of my gall
[ch]Dm[/ch]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Don't you make me wanna scream[/tab]
when you find out that you dream
I really wanna sing
and Life is so hard

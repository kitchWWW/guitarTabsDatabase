[tab]	     [ch]Am[/ch]
You've made a hole in my heart,[/tab]

[tab]	    [ch]Am[/ch]
And they can say what they want but it doesn't mean a thing,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]				[ch]Dm[/ch]
Even if they went inside me and changed everything,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
This hole is nothing that a doctor can cure,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]		      [ch]Dm[/ch]

[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
But I got inside, I got inside,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]				[ch]G[/ch]

You turn me upside down[/tab]


[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]				    [ch]C[/ch]
And the gap that you have made goes deep inside of me,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]				     [ch]F[/ch]
It's all used to invade girl, you've got my guarantee,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]				    [ch]C[/ch]
And what this is you do to me it's not been done before,[/tab]

I don't want to stop no, that's for sure[/tab]

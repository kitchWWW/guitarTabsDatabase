[Verse 1]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
The trees, they grow high, and the leaves, they do grow green[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
Many is the time my true love I've seen[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
Many an hour I watched him all alone[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
He's young but he's daily growing[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]
Father, dear father, you've done me great wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
You have married me to a boy who is too young[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
I am twice twelve and he is but fourteen[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
He's young but he's daily growing[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
Daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
I have married you to a great lord's son[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
And he will be a man for you when I am dead and gone[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
He's young but he's daily growing[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
Father, dear father, if you see fit[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
We'll send him to college for another year yet[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]
I'll tie a blue ribbon all around his head[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]F[/ch]
To let the maidens know that he is married[/tab]


[Verse 5]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
One day I was looking over my father's castle wall[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
I spied all the boys playing with a ball[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]
And my own true love, he was the flower of them all[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
He's young but he's daily growing[/tab]

[Verse 6]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
And so early in the morning at the dawning of the day[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
They went into a hayfield for to have some sport and play[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
And what they did there, oh, she never would declare[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
But she never more complained of his growing[/tab]


[Verse 7]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]
At the age of fourteen he was a married man[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
At the age of fifteen, the father of my son[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
At the age of sixteen, his grave, it was green[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
And death had put an end to his growing[/tab]


[Verse 8]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
I'll buy my love some flannel, I'll make my love a shroud[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
And every stitch I put in it, the tears, they'll pour down[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
And every stitch I put in it, how the tears, they will flow[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
Cruel fate has put an end to his growing[/tab]

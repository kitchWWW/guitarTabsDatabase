Artist: Amanda Anne Platt & The Honeycutters
Song: The Road
Genre: 
Key: A


The picking pattern she uses is sort of a modified version of Travis picking, plucking the bass notes with
her thumb and alternating between percussively hitting the rest of the strings and picking them individually.
Additionally, she sometimes does hammer-ons on the bass notes - mostly notabley during transitions between
a verse and chorus or vice versa.

    I'm not angry please don't say you're sorry any more[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
    Look at you, you're beautiful, there's nothing to be sorry for[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
    Think of all the trouble that's been knocking at the door[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D/F#[/ch]
There's no shame in being tired of this war[/tab]

[Verse 2]

    There have been much worse mistakes than those the likes of us have made[/tab]

Now it seems the kindest thing to do is cut loose and let go of you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And learn to love the crooked hands that built me[/tab]

[Chorus 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
    If time and distance make us strangers[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
    Change our hearts and rearrange us[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
I'll look forward to the day my new eyes look upon your face[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
And recognize the smile of an old friend[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D/F#[/ch]
I hope the road is good to you 'til then[/tab]

Now don't look back and don't you cry; let's not waste breath on our goodbyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
    We took 'em with us every place we've been[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
And all our lives we've lived inside this slow moving storm[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
You'd better go before the rain picks up again[/tab]

[Chorus 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
    If time and distance make us strangers[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
    Change our hearts and rearrange us[/tab]

Those are the only real chords.  

That last chord, I use ring finger on 6th string, index finger on 5th string, middle
finger on 4th string, and pinky on 3rd string.  Then just use the pinky to barre the
1st and 2nd strings at the end of the phrase.

Also play them with open 1st and 2nd strings for the verses.  

Definately a fun little riff.

[Intro]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
I've been working these years for peanuts[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
wondering my own impending doom[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
but as an elephant I'm only really relevant[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
when I'm standing in a room[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
and I'd like to live my life just like a dog[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
humble as can be and unconditional in everything I love[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
or maybe I could be more like a lion[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
clean my teeth on all the bloody bones I kill to feed my lion child[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
but a lion-hearted man still wants to find someone he can love[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
like a dog I'll roam this land[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
to find the bone that I've been dreaming of[/tab]

(and then it could be like uhh)

[Outro]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
and a bird can fly away, but I'd rather find a reason I should stay[/tab]

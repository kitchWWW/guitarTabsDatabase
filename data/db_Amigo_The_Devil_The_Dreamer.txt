[ch]C[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

Verse 1.
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I'm so God damn tired of whistling. I'm so lonesome I could cry.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                                [ch]A[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]
Your eyes, they look like diamonds, still stuck inside the mines.[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
I'll dig 'em out.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                                        [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
And I know that you're waiting around to find the right man, you say.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                                          [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
But the thing about taking your time is it takes it right back, some day.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                       [ch]Am[/ch]
No one deserves my world quite like you do.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
And it's true, I hate everything but you.[/tab]

[Chorus-ish]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
So tonight I'll follow you home[/tab]
Start up a fire that will keep us both warm and I'll
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Drag my  lips up your thighs, wait 'till you open your eyes[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]F[/ch]
And I'll hold you real still.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
And if I can't have you, nobody will.[/tab]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Winter was leaving early, that chill to the bone.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                                    [ch]A[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]
And I kissed you every morning, as the wind whistled on.[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
But God's humour did too.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                             [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
When you're as happy as this, time starts to fly, it's true.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                                          [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
But I built these wings after jumping, not dreaming of the sky for you.[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]
And it's all for you.[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
My skin is grey too.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
And I'll lay by your side 'till everything is rotten through.[/tab]

[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
So tonight we'll celebrate life.[/tab]
Eat the best food and we'll drink the best wine and we'll
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Make love too. Dreaming every moment of you,[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
Your chest against mine. My gun against your spine.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
And we'll leave the world the way dreamers do.[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]
And it's all for you.[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]
It's all for you.[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F[/ch]
These things that I do.[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]
They're all for you.[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F[/ch]
My skin is grey too.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
It's all for you.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
And I'll lay by your side 'till everything is rotten through.[/tab]

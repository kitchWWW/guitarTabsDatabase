[Intro]
[ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
She walked in the park in the dark[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Her best friend was her own heartbeat[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
With every little step she'd take[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
She'd get one step closer to leeeaavin'[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Sittin' in kitchen at night[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
She listened to the washing machine[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Wishing that she could leeeaave[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
But there were so many loads to clean[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
She could hear it in her head sometimes[/tab]

Like the change she'd been savin' in a jar
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]
And the chains on the front porch swing[/tab]

Were creakin' like steps in the dark

[Refrain]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
One day soon[/tab]

This is all gonna end
[tab][ch]G[/ch]            N.C.
One day soon...[/tab]
[tab]N.C.            [ch]Dm[/ch]
Maybe it'll all begin[/tab]

[Interlude]
[ch]F[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
She'd hear it from him all the time[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
He was the best she'd ever seen[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Stompin' up and down the hall[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
But she could still hear her washing machine[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
She could hear it in her head sometimes[/tab]

Like the change she's been savin' in a jar
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]
And the chains on the front porch swing[/tab]

Were creakin' like steps in the dark

[Refrain]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
One day soon[/tab]

This is all gonna end
[tab][ch]G[/ch]            N.C.
One day soon...[/tab]
[tab]N.C.            [ch]Dm[/ch]
Maybe it'll all begin[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
What a fine mess[/tab]

Fine mess indeed
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
A little too much for me[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
For me and my washing machine[/tab]

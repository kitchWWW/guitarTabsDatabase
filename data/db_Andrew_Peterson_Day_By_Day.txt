[Intro]
[ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]
Well, we took a train to kensington[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]
And listened to the children run[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
Just beyond the garden gate[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
Where peter and wendy played[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
There was a sign that said we weren't allowed[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bb[/ch]
To duck inside and join the crowd[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]
Without a son or daughter's hand[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
To lead us into neverland[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]
And it hurt so bad[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]
But it's so good to be young[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
And I don't want to go back[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
I just want to go on and on and on[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
Day by day, day by day[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]
Oh, and everybody's so surprised[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bb[/ch]
When right before your very eyes[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]
Your baby's in the second grade[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]
You blink and it's her wedding day[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
Well we just can't get used to being here[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bb[/ch]
Where the ticking clock is loud and clear[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
Children of eternity[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F[/ch]
On the run from entropy[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]
And it hurt so bad[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]
But it's so good to be young[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
And I don't want to go back[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
I just want to go on and on and on[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]Bb[/ch]
So don't lose heart[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]Bb[/ch]
Though your body's wasting away[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
Your soul is not[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bb[/ch]
It's being remade[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
Day by day by day, day by day, day by day[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]               [ch]Bb[/ch]
Well, you have never met a single soul[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]
Who didn't feel the curse's toll[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F[/ch]
Who didn't wish that death would die[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]
Well maybe that's the reason why[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
I can hurt so bad[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]
But it's so good to be young[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
And I don't want to go back[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]Bb[/ch]
I just want to go on and on and on, on and on and on[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]Bb[/ch]
So don't lose heart[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]Bb[/ch]
Though your body's wasting away[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]
Your soul is not[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bb[/ch]
It's being remade[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Bb[/ch]
Don't lose heart[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Bb[/ch]
No don't lose heart[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
Your body will rise and never decay[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
Day by day by day. day by day, day by day[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Day by day[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
If you'll step inside this great glass elevator[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
It'll take us up above the city lights[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
To where the planet curves away to the equator[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bb[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
I want to show you something fine[/tab]

You can see the roads that we all traveled just to get here[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Bb[/ch]
A million minuscule decisions in a line[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
Why they brought us to this moment isn't clear[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
But that's all right, we've got all night[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]
Could it be that the many roads[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]
You took to get here[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Were just for me to tell this story[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]               [ch]Bb[/ch]
And for you to hear this song[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bb[/ch]
And your many hopes[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
And your many fears[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
Were meant to bring you here all along[/tab]

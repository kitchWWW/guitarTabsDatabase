[tab]           [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]A#[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]

[tab][ch]A#[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]

[tab]           [ch]Cm[/ch]    [ch]Gm[/ch]                  [ch]D#[/ch] 
Wondering why, why it was I hadn't found her[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
   I was staring at eyes[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Cm[/ch]
Smiling at smiles[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Gm[/ch]                  [ch]D#[/ch]
Still I was none the wiser[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]A#[/ch]
And you know I don't[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]

(Bridge)
[tab]      [ch]A#[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]                  
So calling all woman who fit this description[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Gm[/ch]                 
If I'm what you're missing[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D#[/ch]                        [ch]A#[/ch]

The clouds they're all screaming out, they're trying to bring you to me[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D#[/ch]                   
So please don't shut them out[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A#[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]Gm[/ch]
Because there is a lady who is made for me[/tab]

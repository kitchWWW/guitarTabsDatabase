[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I've stopped looking for reasons[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
I gave up long ago[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Got no say in the matter[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
It's like somebody chose[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
That I will always be close to you[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Can't fight the force of nature[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Bm[/ch]
It's beyond my control[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Some things don't need explaining[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Some things are already known[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
That I will always be close to you[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
Just like the ocean can't leave the shoreline[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                                        [ch]C[/ch]
Just like the sun can't help but to shine on through[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
This heart was made to be close to you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Just like the days can't escape the nights[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                                        [ch]C[/ch]
I'm just like a shadow can't leave your side, it's true[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
This heart was made to be close to you[/tab]


[Post-Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Woah-oh[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
Woah-oh-oh-oh[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
Woah-oh[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
It's in my constitution[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
It's in my DNA[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Impossible to lose it[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
You live inside of me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
And I will always be close to you[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Can't fight the force of nature[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bm[/ch]
Way beyond my control[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Some things don't need explaining[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Some things are already known[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
And I will always be close to you[/tab]

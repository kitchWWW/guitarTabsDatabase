[Intro]

[ch]F#[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]              [ch]F#[/ch]
Girl, it's astounding the way that you ground me,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D#m[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]
Just by being around me. Help me stay true.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F#[/ch]
Behind every man is a woman standing,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D#m[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]
Holding his hand and seeing him through.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]F#[/ch]
You're my co-pilot,[/tab]

Always by my side, looking so fly!
[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch] [ch]D#m[/ch]
Baby, you got me![/tab]

Clouds hit the sky,
[tab]                      [ch]G#m[/ch]
I know that I'm never flying,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#[/ch]         [ch]F#[/ch]
In the lightning alone.[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]           [ch]F#[/ch]
Freedom is overrated and over.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D#m[/ch]                       [ch]B[/ch]
Do it alone, and that goes for me, too.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F#[/ch]
Just like a story without an ending,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D#m[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]
Baby, I'm nothing without you.[/tab]


[Chorus] 
[tab]             [ch]F#[/ch]
You're my co-pilot,[/tab]

Always by my side, looking so fly!
[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch] [ch]D#m[/ch]
Baby, you got me![/tab]

Clouds hit the sky,
[tab]                      [ch]G#m[/ch]
I know that I'm never flying,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#[/ch]         [ch]F#[/ch]
In the lightning alone.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F#[/ch]
You're my co-pilot,[/tab]

Always by my side, looking so fly!
[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch] [ch]D#m[/ch]
Baby, you got me![/tab]

Clouds hit the sky,
[tab]                      [ch]G#m[/ch]
I know that I'm never flying,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#[/ch]         [ch]F#[/ch]
In the lightning alone.[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                [ch]D#m[/ch]
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh! Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh![/tab]
[tab]            [ch]B[/ch]
And nearly every time that I lean off track,[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G#m[/ch]                          [ch]F#[/ch]
You don't even know it, but you lead me back.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                [ch]D#m[/ch]
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh! Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh![/tab]
[tab]               [ch]B[/ch]
And when I'm swimming in the dark,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G#m[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]
You are the compass of my heart.[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]G#m[/ch]
No one can do it alone.[/tab]


[Chorus] 
[tab]             [ch]F#[/ch]
You're my co-pilot,[/tab]

Always by my side, looking so fly!
[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch] [ch]D#m[/ch]
Baby, you got me![/tab]

Clouds hit the sky,
[tab]                      [ch]G#m[/ch]
I know that I'm never flying,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#[/ch]         [ch]F#[/ch]
In the lightning alone.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F#[/ch]
You're my co-pilot,[/tab]

Always by my side, looking so fly!
[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch] [ch]D#m[/ch]
Baby, you got me![/tab]

Clouds hit the sky,
[tab]                      [ch]G#m[/ch]
I know that I'm never flying,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#[/ch]         [ch]F#[/ch]
In the lightning alone.[/tab]

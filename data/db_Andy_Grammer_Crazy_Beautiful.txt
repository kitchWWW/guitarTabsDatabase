Andy Grammer - Crazy Beautiful 

Standard tuning
No capo


Verse 1:
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
She's got big brown eyes and tangled hair[/tab]

Voguing in her underwear
[tab]    [ch]Bm7[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
And nothing is better than doing nothing together now[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
She's got a toothbrush as a microphone[/tab]

Belting out the Rolling Stones
[tab]        [ch]Bm7[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
I'm the last one to stop her can't believe that I got her[/tab]

Pre-Chorus:
[tab]   [ch]Bm7[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
We get so close, kissing like Eskimos[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
It's a little bit much[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
I know, I do[/tab]

Chorus:
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]   
Isn't she cra-crazy beautiful[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm7[/ch] 
Isn't she stra-strange and wonderful[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                                         [ch]D[/ch]
And I think I love her more than I even understand[/tab]

Verse 2:  
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
She's got a classic style that's all her own[/tab]

Smile you can hear through the telephone
[tab]    [ch]Bm7[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
She says she's a rebel, but she's way too sentimental[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
She's precious even when she's mad[/tab]

Gets angry and I start to laugh
[tab]      [ch]Bm7[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
And I know that it's nothing she's just pushing my buttons[/tab]

Pre-Chorus:
[tab]   [ch]Bm7[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
We get so close, kissing like Eskimos[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
It's a little bit much[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
I know, I do[/tab]

And I think I love her more than I even understand[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
She's a little bit wild, a little bit mad, a little bit uh oh, beautiful[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm7[/ch]

[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse 1] 

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  You're not the type[/tab]

Type of girl to remain
[tab]         [ch]D/F#[/ch]
With the guy, with the guy too shy[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
Too afraid to say, he'll give his heart to you forever[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  I'm not the boy that will fall to his knees[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D/F#[/ch]
With his hands clenched tight[/tab]

Begging, begging you please
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
To stay with him for worse and for better[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
  But I'm staring at you now[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
There's no one else around[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
I'm thinking you're the girl for me[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
I'm just saying it's fine by me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
If you never leave[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G/B[/ch]
And we can live like this forever[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
It's fine by me[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  In the past I would try[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Try hard to commit to a girl[/tab]

Wouldn't get too far
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
And it always somehow seemed to fall apart[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  And with you, you, you[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D/F#[/ch]
I can see what I need[/tab]

I can dream realistically
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                                      [ch]C[/ch]
I knew that this was different from the start[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  And it seems that every time[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D/F#[/ch]
We're eye to eye[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
I can find another piece of you[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
That I don't wanna lose[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
  And I'm staring at you now[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
There's no one else around[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
I'm thinking you're the girl I need[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
I'm just saying it's fine by me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
If you never leave[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G/B[/ch]
And we can live like this forever[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
It's fine by me[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
I'm just saying it's fine by me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
If you never leave[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G/B[/ch]
And we can live like this forever[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
It's fine by me[/tab]


[Bridge]
 
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
  And it's never easy[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]  
Darling, believe me[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
I'm as skeptical as you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
  When I think of life without 'us'[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
She's like "what we supposed to do?"[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
But I don't wanna come on too strong[/tab]

N.C.
I'm just saying it's fine by me

If you never leave

We can live like this forever

It's fine by me


[Chorus]

[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
I'm just saying it's fine by me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
If you never leave[/tab]

And we can live like this forever[/tab]

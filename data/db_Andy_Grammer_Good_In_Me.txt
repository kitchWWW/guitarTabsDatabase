[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I like the way, like the way that I look in your eyes[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I like the place, like the place I take up in your mind[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bm[/ch]
I fall on my face, never judgmental[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
See, I see mistakes, you see potential[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I been afraid, been afraid if I open the door[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
That all of my pain will come out and roll onto the floor[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
And it did, and it does, but you still pick it up[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
You find a way to see the good in me[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I know I’m a lot to handle[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I know that my heart’s a handful[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                             [ch]A[/ch]
Even in the dark, somehow you see[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
The good in me, good in me[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I know that I’m far from perfect[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And you say that my flaws are worth it[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]                                              [ch]A[/ch]
And even when it’s hard, I know you see[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
The good in me, good in me[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I’m like a flood, like a flood, I get carried away[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah, sayin’ too much, lotta things that I don’t mean to say[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]
But you give me space, showin’ me patience[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
And maybe we bend, but we never break it[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I been afraid, been afraid if I open the door[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
That all of my pain will come out and roll onto the floor[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
And it did, and it does, but you still pick it up[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
You find a way to see the good in me[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I know I’m a lot to handle[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I know that my heart’s a handful[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                             [ch]A[/ch]

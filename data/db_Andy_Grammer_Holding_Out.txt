Holding Out by Andy Grammer

This song is in 4/4 time.

To make it easier to play, I wrote the chords as though they had four beats each:
[ch]A[/ch] / / / [ch]D[/ch] / / / [ch]F#m[/ch] / / / [ch]E[/ch] / / /

[tab]However, the [ch]A[/ch] and [ch]F#m[/ch] really have three beats each while the [ch]D[/ch] and [ch]E[/ch] have five.  
It's really supposed to be:[/tab]
[ch]A[/ch] / / [ch]D[/ch] / / / / [ch]F#m[/ch] / / [ch]E[/ch] / / / /



[Verse 1:]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]F#m[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
   When I met you, love, I hadn't done the dirty yet,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]F#m[/ch]                 ([ch]E[/ch])
Call me the unicorn, they said that I didn't exist,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]F#m[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
Truth is my heart was torn, the v had a couple of rips[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]F#m[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]
But I was still holding on to the edge with my finger tips[/tab]

[Pre-chorus:]

[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
With a little bit of prayer, little bit of porn, sorry,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F#m[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]
Couple long nights of sleeping on my own[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Waiting for the right one to come along[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F#m[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]
Waiting for the right one and now I know[/tab]

[Chorus:]

[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]F#m[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]

[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]F#m[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]

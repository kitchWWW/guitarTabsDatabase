[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]                          [ch]Db[/ch]
On the way, I was crowned a king[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bbm[/ch]                [ch]Ab[/ch]
Felt the wind underneath my wings[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]                            [ch]Db[/ch]
I've been high and I've been low[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bbm[/ch]                      [ch]Ab[/ch]
Played the fool and the star of the show[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]                          [ch]Db[/ch]
Gone along for a wild ride[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bbm[/ch]                [ch]Ab[/ch]
And I can say lookin' in your eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]                          [ch]Db[/ch]
That it all would've been a waste[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bbm[/ch]                [ch]Db[/ch]
But I found you on the way[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]                 [ch]Gb[/ch]
I found cynicism, I found criticism[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Db[/ch]
I've been the zero, the hero[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Gb[/ch]
And I have been the villain[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bbm[/ch]                [ch]Db[/ch]
I lost more than a heart can take[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Gb[/ch]             [ch]Db[/ch]
But I found you on the way (On the way)[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]           [ch]Gb[/ch]
I found you, I found you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]           [ch]Gb[/ch]
I found you, I found you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]                    [ch]Db[/ch]
It all would've been a waste[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]                    [ch]Db[/ch]
But I found you on the way[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]                          [ch]Db[/ch]
On the way, I was given the keys[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bbm[/ch]                     [ch]Ab[/ch]
To the city, they were mine to keep[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Gb[/ch]                          [ch]Db[/ch]
Over time, every lock'll change[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bbm[/ch]                    [ch]Db[/ch]
But you love me all the same[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab] [ch]Db[/ch]                 [ch]Gb[/ch]
I found pessimism, I found skepticism[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Db[/ch]                 [ch]Gb[/ch]
I've been the corner performer and sung in front of millions[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bbm[/ch]                [ch]Db[/ch]
I lost more than a heart can take[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Gb[/ch]               [ch]Db[/ch]
But I found you on the way (On the way)[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Db[/ch]           [ch]Gb[/ch]
I found you, I found you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]           [ch]Gb[/ch]
I found you, I found you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]                    [ch]Db[/ch]
It all would've been a waste[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]                    [ch]Db[/ch]
But I found you on the way[/tab]


[Post Chorus]
[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]       [ch]Db[/ch]
Whoa, whoa[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]      [ch]Db[/ch]
Whoa, whoa[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]                           [ch]Db[/ch]
On the way, I'll have won the race[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]
If the one thing that I can say[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Db[/ch]           [ch]Gb[/ch]
I found you, I found you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]           [ch]Gb[/ch]
I found you, I found you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]                    [ch]Db[/ch]
It all would've been a waste[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]                    [ch]Db[/ch]
But I found you on the way[/tab]


[Outro]

(Whoa, whoa)
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]           [ch]Gb[/ch]
I found you, I found you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]           [ch]Gb[/ch]
I found you, I found you[/tab]

(Whoa, whoa)
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]           [ch]Gb[/ch]
I found you, I found you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]                [ch]Db[/ch]
I found you on the way[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
 I've been waiting on the sunset[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am7[/ch]
Bills on my mindset[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I can't deny they're getting high[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Higher than my income[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am7[/ch]
My income's breadcrumbs[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]     
I've been trying to survive[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
The glow that the sun gives[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am7[/ch]
Right around sunset[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]
Helps me realize[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]
This is just a journey[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am7[/ch]
Drop your worries[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
You're gonna turn out fine.[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Gsus4[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Oh, you'll turn out fine.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Gsus4[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Fine, oh, you'll turn out fine.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]N.C.                    [ch]Dm7[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
But you gotta keep your head up, oh,[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am7[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
And you can let your hair down, eh.[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Dm7[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
You gotta keep your head up, oh,[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am7[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
And you can let your hair down, eh.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
I know it's hard, know it's hard,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am7[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
To remember sometimes,[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Dm7[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
But you gotta keep your head up, oh,[/tab]

And you can let your hair down, eh.[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
 I've got my hands in my pockets,[/tab]

Kickin' these rocks.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Dm7[/ch]

[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]  
I'm buyin' into skeptics,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am7[/ch]
Skeptics mess with,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Dm7[/ch]
The confidence in my eyes.[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
I'm seeing all the angles,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am7[/ch]
Starts to get tangled[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I start to compromise[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
My life and the purpose.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am7[/ch]
Is it all worth it?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
Am I gonna turn out fine?[/tab]

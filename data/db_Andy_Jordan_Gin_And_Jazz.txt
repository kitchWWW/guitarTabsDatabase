Even when I was at home it was the same games[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]
It was the same names, haunting me like demons[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
When I left you at the train I was screaming[/tab]

Tears flooding my heart 'cause I knew the ship was sinking[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]Em[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
We were strangers side by side[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
My car was big and I knew he needed a ride[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
A man of two truths trained to shout[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
So I fell in love with him on both sides of his mouth[/tab]

And I said

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
Amen, amen, amen, amen[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
Something told me not to run[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
Said I'd be the one, I'd be the one, I'd be the one[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
I'd be the one to drive him home[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
He feared he'd fall[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
Didn't know[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Said I was everything that he'd been dreaming of[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
He crawled inside me to my core[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
And pointed north to stars I'd never seen before[/tab]

And I said

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
Amen, amen, amen, amen[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
Something told me not to run[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
Said I'd be the one, I'd be the one, I'd be the one[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]
To touch him like he was my own[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                          [ch]D[/ch]
And I'd drive him home, I'd drive him home, I'd drive him home[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
I'd be the one to drive him[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
I don't want to have him just to hold[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
I want a ring of fire, he's got a ring of gold[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
But he don't want to have me just to hold[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
He wants a ring of fire, I want his word of gold[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]
And I won't mind laying with fire[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
When we're running up and up we can unfold[/tab]
[ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I would ride with him all life long[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
I wouldn't share him for a story or a song[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
His eyes pled, "don't leave"[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But I knew best[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
Even though it burns like battery acid in my chest[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
Something told me I should run[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
Said I'd be the one, I'd be the one, I'd be the one[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
To love him more than my need to own[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                          [ch]D[/ch]
And I'd drive him home, I'd drive him home, I'd drive him home[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
I won't be raining like a stone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
No they won't know I drove him home, I drove him home[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
But if someday my bird is flown[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
If my light's still on, my window's drawn and I'm alone[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
I'll be the one[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
I'll be the one[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
I'll be the one[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
To drive him home[/tab]

Let I
Cry sight
A child at night

I can
Have courage
To receive your love

I can
Step steps
Follow my blind

Inside
My self
The secret grows

My own
Shelter
Agony goes


I was born to adore you
As a baby in the blind

I was born to represent you
To carry your head into the sun
To carve you face into the back of the sun

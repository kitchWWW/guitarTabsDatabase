 LYRICS
**********
When I'm floating in the water
And your eyes are lilies all around
When I'm lying sweetly in my bed
The sun plays crystal with my eyes

Then I stop
My body stops crying for home
My limbs stop weeping for home

When I'm peeping in a parlour of trees
And the leaves are winking all around
I'm home, my heart sobs in my veins
But brains they play the softest games

Fingers kiss the string
Mouth taste the bladeÂ of everglade
Of everglade

Musically there's not really anything to it. It is the same F arpeggio
played over and over again. You can sort of play it on guitar like this is:

[tab]  F
:---|-5-----------:
:---|-------6-----:
:-5-|-----5-------:
:---|---7---------:
:---|-8-----------:
:---|-------------:[/tab]

Behind this is a symphony orchestra creating an ambient soundscape.
Here I have listed the most prominent notes of the soundscape,
then what function they have for the F chord, then when they enter.

  G    add9    (0:18)
  D    add13   (0:34)
  G    add2    (0:58)
  E    maj7    (1:02)




Speaking on this track is Dr. Julia Yasuda, a Japanese renowned mathematician,
who is also transgender; I have also read that he was even born hermaphrodite.
He is reading aloud from an old African-American slave-related poem. The poem
is originally by an anonymous author, but was used as spiritual chant among
slaves in America.
Dr. Julia Yasuda frequently opens Antony and the Johnsons shows with a telegraph.
Below all this is the mystical Morse code. I can't decipher Morse codes myself,
but I have read two things. Either that it is the poem, simply in Morse code;
or that is is the lines "relentlessly craving wanderlust", which I doubt it is.
It is a line from the Bj√∂rk's song "Wanderlust" from her 2007 album "Volta".
If anyone knows any more stuff, I'd love to hear it! Just mail me! :D



 LYRICS
**********
Way down yonder in the graveyard walk
I thank God I'm free at last
Me and my Jesus gonna meet and talk
I thank God I'm free at last

On my knees when the light passed by
I thank God I'm free at last
Thought my soul would rise and fly
I thank God I'm free at last

Some of these mornings, bright and fair
I thank God I'm free at last
Gonna meet my Jesus in the middle of the air
I thank God I'm free at last

Ladies and gentlemen
Antony &amp; The Johnsons

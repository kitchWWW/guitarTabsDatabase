   I find you        with red tears in your eyes [/tab]

I ask you what is your name 
You offer no reply 
Should I call a doctor 
Before I fear you might be dead 
But I just lay down beside you 
And held your hand 


Capo on 5th

[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]                       
     I fell in love with you [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]      
      Now you're my one, only one [/tab]

'Cause all my life I've been so blue 
But in that moment you fulfilled me 

Now I'll tell all my friends 
I fell in love with a dead boy 
Now I'll tell my family 
I wish you could have met him 

Now I write letters to Australia 
Now I throw bottles out to sea 
I whisper the secret in the ground 
No one's gonna take you away from me 

I fell in love with a dead boy 
Oh, such a beautiful boy 
I fell in love with a dead boy 
Oh, such a beautiful boy 

Oh, such a beautiful boy 
I'm asking 
Are you a boy or a girl 
Are you a boy or are you a girl 
Are you a boy or are you a girl 

Are you a boy 
Are you a girl 
Are you a boy 
Are you a girl 
Are you a boy 
Are you a girl

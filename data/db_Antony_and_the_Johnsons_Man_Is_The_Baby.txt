 Verse:
Key: G minor
What is played here is these chords with the melody incorporated.
Play it very freely, which creates this freely expressionistic sound.
The root notes of the first Ebmaj7s are very low.

| [ch]Ebmaj7[/ch] | [ch]Ebmaj7[/ch] | [ch]Bbmaj7[/ch] | [ch]Gm9[/ch] |
| [ch]Ebmaj7[/ch] | [ch]Ebmaj7[/ch] | [ch]Bbmaj7[/ch] | [ch]Gm9[/ch] |



 Chorus: (notice the bass staying on G in the first line)

| [ch]F/G[/ch] | [ch]Eb/G[/ch] | [ch]Dm/G[/ch] | [ch]Gm[/ch] |

| [ch]F[/ch] | [ch]Eb[/ch] | [ch]Dm[/ch] | [ch]Gsus2[/ch] | [ch]Gsus2[/ch] |



 Verse



 Chorus:
Now the symphony is seriously playing in, and extending the chords.
If you want, you can extend the chords to this:

| [ch]F6[/ch] | [ch]Ebmaj9[/ch] | [ch]Dm7[/ch] | [ch]Gm9[/ch] |
| [ch]F6[/ch] | [ch]Ebmaj9[/ch] | [ch]Dm7[/ch] | [ch]Gsus4[/ch] |



 Strings interlude:
Wonderful arrangement, but it doesn't really fit into a guitar tab,
so I transcribed it into Guitar Pro instead. Just follow the link:

 Chorus
Instead of Gsus4, go to an Eb:

[tab] [ch]Dm7[/ch]           [ch]Eb[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]               Gm9...

 LYRICS
**********
Yearning for more than a blue day
I enter your new life for me
Burning for the true day
I welcome your new life for me

Forgive me
Let live me
Set my spirit free

Losing, it comes in a cold wave
of guilt and shame all over me
Child has arrived in the darkness
The hollow triumph of a tree

Forgive me
Let live me
Kiss my falling knee
Forgive me
Let live me
Bless my destiny

Forgive me
Let live me
Set my spirit free
Weakness sown
Overgrown
Man is the baby

As typical for the songs off The Crying Light, the arrangement of this song
is very indistinct/blurry/muzzy in its own beautifully easthetic way.
... that's a bitch to transcribe though :D
It's difficult to find any particular things to play, but there IS a little
structure in the haze though! In the bottom of this soundscape, there is a
neat little guitar-figure - in the verses only, that is.


 The guitar-figure:
An acoustic guitar plays this little part for a verse.
Pick the B- and E-strings with your index and long finger,
while picking the bass notes with your thumb.
As notated, repeat each line.

 LYRICS
**********
One dove
You're the one I've been waiting for
Through the dark fall
The nightmares, the lonely nights

I was born
A curling fox in a hole
Hiding from danger
Scared to be alone

One dove
To bring me some peace
In starlight you came from the other side
To offer me mercy

One dove
I'm the one you've been waiting for
From your skin I am born again
I wasn't born yesterday

You were old and hurt
I was longing to be free
I see things you were too tired
That you were too scared to see

One dove
To bring me some peace
In starlight you came from the other side
To offer me mercy

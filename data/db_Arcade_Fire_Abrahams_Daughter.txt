[tab][ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]C/G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
Abraham took Isaac's hand and led him to the lonesome hill[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
While his daughter hid and watched[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C/G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
She dared not breathe, she was so still[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]C/G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
Just as an angel cries for the slaughter, Abraham's daughter raised her voice[/tab]


[tab][ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]C/G[/ch]
Then the angel asked her what her name was[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
She said, "I have none."[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
Then he asked, "How can this be?"[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C/G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]
"My father never gave me one."[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]C/G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
And with his sword raised for the slaughter, Abraham's daughter raised her[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
bow[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
"How darest you, child, defy your father!"[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C/G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
"You better let young Isaac go."[/tab]

Artist: Argyle Johansen
Song: Sunny Day In Hell
Genre: 
Key: 


This song played on Californication and I loved it, but apparently it's not a 
known song at all, theres
no tabs, chords or even lyrics anywhere, so I figured I might as well write it down and put it out
where. the chords were easy but English is not my main language, so i'm not sure about the lyrics.
so I urge anyone with a good english ear to correct the words that I've put in 
"quotations", and write
it down in a reply og a message to me. 
Thank you :)

I woke up today, to hear the weatherman say[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
it was gonna be another sunny day in Hell[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]
now this "west" stuck in my hand, and I just don't understand[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]
how this guy made the life but I'm still here[/tab]

see this "boner" memory with this picture on TV
and I "asked that though" and I took it on the chin 
now I sit here passively smoking like a chimney
and I wonder sometimes where it all went south

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
      on a sunny day in Hell, a sunny day in Hell [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
      on a sunny day in Hell, a sunny day in Hell [/tab]

so they got me to my feet, and pushed me out on to the street 
in a "taxi cap till" waiting room I spent 
when in her sunday clothes came a girl named "Alyn" Rose
who "self" looked up while I was looking low  

on a sunny day in Hell, a sunny day in Hell 
on a sunny day in Hell, a sunny day in Hell 

from the times when I'd forgotten, that you called me Johnny Rotten 
and you told me you'd be sittin' in the sun 
down half the river side where I can sit and hide
and think about some things I hadn't done

on a sunny day in Hell, a sunny day in Hell 
on a sunny day in Hell, a sunny day in Hell

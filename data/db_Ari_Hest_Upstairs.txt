Part1
Everyone is covered in black and blue
rough edges that once were smooth, impenatrable
And everyone is different than me and you
Drinking from a posion pool that doesnt run out

Part 2
Did I have you just then?
YOur elusive as a feather falling
Never once well prepared
I wish I knew what was going on upstairs
Part1
Youre the one, whos aimlessly wandering
Drifting where the wind swings and staggering home
ANd youre the one who sold me the lonely heart
And asked me to hand it back so you could sell it for less
Part2
Did I have you just then?
YOur elusive as a feather falling
Never once well prepared
I wish I knew what was going on upstairs

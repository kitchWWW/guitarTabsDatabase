I'm sure I got the lyrics terribly wrong to this but there were none posted that I could 
on the internet so I had to do lyrics by ear. The chords here I believe are accurate, 
sound best when barred.

(Verse Progression:)
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
Next time when I’m pulling it together[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F#m[/ch]                                [ch]C#m[/ch]
Remember that she dropped you in the brine[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]   [ch]Cm[/ch]      [ch]Bm[/ch]
I    don’t   mind[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]E[/ch]
If I ever stop believin’ let it go[/tab]

(Instrumental Verse Progression x1)

(Verse Progression x2)
And in my mind I’m swung by drunk persuasion
I’m in my bed and lonely I will lie
I     would   mind
if I never get to see you I don’t mind
In the end it might be like forever
I’m really sure she used up all her lies
I     don’t   mind
if your heart and all stop breathing let it go

(Prechorus Progression:)
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]F#m[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
You will see me as I’m always wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]F#m[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]
I will leave it if you call back home[/tab]

(Chorus Progression:)
[tab][ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
You’ll always be the one that wakes my tired eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]F#m[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]
 Always be the one I shy away[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
You’ll always be the one that feeds my thin sides[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]F#m[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]
 Always be the one I drive away[/tab]

(Verse Progression x1)
When the baker’s bread has gone and soured
Its rotten and she sickens by the day
But you didn’t give me time to make it right
You wouldn’t put the time in
All the doctors poke their eyes and they were smiling

(Prechorus Progression x1)
Come to see me as I’m always wrong
I will leave you and delete your songs

(Chorus Progression x1)
You’ll always be the one that wakes my tired eyes
Always be the one I shy away
You’ll always be the one that feeds my sides
Always be the one I drive away

(Instrumental Verse Progression x1)

(verse Progression x1)
In the canyon coyotes eat the kittens
And this is what they do just to survive
Hear their cries
And let them die

(Instrumental Chorus Progression x1) -
(Chorus Progression x2)
You’ll always be the one that wakes my tired eyes
Always be the one I shy away
You’ll always be the one that feeds my insides
Always be the one I drive away
You’ll always be the one that wakes my tired eyes
Always be the one I shy away
You’ll always be the one that feeds my insides
Always be the one I drive away

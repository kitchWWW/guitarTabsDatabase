Genre: 
Key: 


BPM:      100
Released: 1 March 2024
Album:    Babyface


Capo: 3 fret

        Alternate or different capo fret positions are easily possible by using the transpose
           button below.
          The chords will automatically adapt to the new capo position.
          Plus 1 on the transpose button means capo fret position one down; minus one
             means capo one fret up.
          Using the Transpose button can affect the placement of the chords in the line. Small
            movements of the chords on the line are possible (depends on length chord names).
          Example: To play this without capo set the transpose button at +3.
                  Half step down tuning set the transpose button at +4.

[Verse 1]
N.C.
Why'd you gotta make it all about my body?
N.C.
I played the part you said to be, you still forgot me,
N.C.
Do you wanna cut me up? And dissect me?
N.C.
Split me at my seams to try to understand me.

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Do I fascinate you?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
So calm yet so disruptive,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I intimidate you?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Jealousies so unattractive,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Sorry, I will not remain,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Trapped inside your little cage,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Running on a wheel,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]
Until you kill me when your feelings changed.[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
But at least I hate you more now than I hate myself.[/tab]

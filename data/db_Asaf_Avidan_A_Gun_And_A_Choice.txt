capo on 3rd

[tab][ch]G[/ch]         
She rots in a cage of your make[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]    
Far away from your eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You stripped all her powers to break[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
With your love and your lies[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Marooned on an island[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
You gave her a gun and a choice[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
But she's crazy about you[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]C[/ch]
She still waits around for your voice[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
What kind of sick, sick love is this, that you left her to die?  x2[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
She rots in a cage of your make[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
As she waits for a sign[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Your gun in her hand[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]C[/ch]
But there isn't a choice in her mind[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
Now there's guilt in your veins[/tab]

'Cause there's guilt in your heart
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
So there's guilt in your blood[/tab]

But you're oceans apart
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
What kind of sick, sick love is this, that you left her to die?[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]  
What kind of sick, sick love is this?[/tab]

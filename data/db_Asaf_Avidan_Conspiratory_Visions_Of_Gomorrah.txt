VERSE 1:

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Sorrow is back in your eyes[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Pulling us to the depth[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm[/ch]
We could have lasted like planets[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]C[/ch]
But your weight dragged us both to our death[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
They've been sober around you[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]F[/ch]
And I truly believed it'll suffice[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
But you're an addict for torture[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
And the sorrow is back   is back in your eyes[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
The minor sonatas of Beethoven[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Roll through your hips[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]
But the words you are aching to sing[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Are glued to your lips[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
They've been burning the wrongly accused[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]
While you silently dance[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
But your beauty was such[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
That they all gladly stood   in line for the chance[/tab]


[ch]F[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]

VERSE 2: 

[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
The amber around you[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
Has stiffened your thought and your limb[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
You're a fossil of love[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
A relic, an echoing hymn[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
The purity that once you delivered[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]
Dissolved into sand[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
Lot has escaped and is dancing[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]C[/ch]
But you're hardly able to stand[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]
You won't work off your debt[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]C[/ch]
Until you strip to your heart and your bone[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
The love that was once in your veins[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
Will dry into stone[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
The mist and the fog[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
Will densen themselves to a wall[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
And you'll finally sing [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
But I won't be there to hear your call[/tab]

[ch]F[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]

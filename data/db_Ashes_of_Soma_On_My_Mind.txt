[Intro]
[ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Someone held their breath tonight[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Hoping for the news[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
They could be in your life[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
And no one ever talks about[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Who dismantled who[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
Would you please let me out[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bb[/ch]
If we just could get it right[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
I would hold you up so high[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]
But it's too late[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
Your time's run out, goodbye[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]
Your heart's gone[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
But I just thought you should know[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
You were on my mind[/tab]


[Instrumental] 
[ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Broken, smashed the bedroom light[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Just what you would do[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
You just need me to fight[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
And someday I'll appreciate[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
I've seen what you can do[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
How you'd please me tonight[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]Bb[/ch]
If we just could get it right[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
I would hold you up so high[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]
But it's too late[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
Your time's run out, goodbye[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]
Your heart's gone[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
But I just thought you should know[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
You were on my mind[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Let those feelings out[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
You're locked up when you're around[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
You were on my mind[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Sometimes I miss the pain[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Something's just been lost[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
I think I'll ask myself again[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Where did we go wrong?[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
And did you think I'd write this song?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]
You hate me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
But that's just what I've learned[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]
Your heart's gone[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
But I just thought you should know[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
You were on my mind[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Let those feelings out[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
You're locked up when you're around[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
You were on my mind[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
(Where did we go wrong?)[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
(And did you think I'd write this song?)[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
You were on my mind[/tab]

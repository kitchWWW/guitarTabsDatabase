Ashes of Soma is such an awesome band. They're a local band from Windsor, and I drove
from Detroit to get their CD. This is the first Ashes of Soma tab ever on the internet, so
hope everyone who likes them finds this tab helpful. PUT A CAPO ON THE FIRST FRET. I 
tabbed the chorus yet, because I don't have enough time right now, but I'll put it
very soon.

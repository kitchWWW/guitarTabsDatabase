for a bucket of change
C#m8         A8
    Hey you smoking
up your sorrows
       C#m8
You're pointing fingers
   A8(hold)
at someone to blame
C#m8
   Hey you you turn your
A8
back on your children
C#m8
   It's left you in
     A8
that big burning bed

A8
living in a gutter

   All this pain's just
A8
made you feel dead

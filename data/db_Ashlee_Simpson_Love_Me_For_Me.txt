Shut up, come back
Know i didn't really mean to say that
I'm mixed up, so what
Yea you want me so you're messed up too
I love you, I hate you
If you only knew what i've been through

My head is spinnin' 
But my heart is in the right place
Sometimes it has to have it's self a little earthquake

Here I am, 
As perfect as i'm ever gonna be
You'll see 
Love me for me
Stick around, 
I'm not the kinda girl you wanna leave
You'll see 
Love me for me

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]B[/ch]
Just so i can push you away [/tab]

You'll see

Love me for me

Whoa, here I am
As perfect as i'm ever gonna be
You'll see 
Love me for me

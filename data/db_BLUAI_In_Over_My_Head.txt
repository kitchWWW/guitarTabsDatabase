[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
It was well past midnight[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
Going over the edges of the day[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
Before me knowing I'll hate it[/tab]

I'll want it to be over soon


[Verse 2]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
Sank into bed to sleep off[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]
The letdown beforehand[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
And I know I'm no good at explaining[/tab]
     N.C.
I couldn't look you in the eye


[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
In over my head[/tab]

I keep saying it's just a rough patch
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
Everybody's messed up[/tab]

I can't tell what's wrong or right
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
In over my head[/tab]

You keep saying it's just a hard time
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
I'm the one who's messed up[/tab]

If only I could take it back
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
In over my[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
For now I'll plot against myself[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]
I'll pull through, I always do[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
And I know I'm kicking in open doors[/tab]

I'm just no good to you


[Chorus]
            Cadd9                             => Catherine stays on Cadd9 on acoustic in the first half
In over my head                                  of this chorus, but you can also play the whole progression

I keep saying it's just a rough patch

Everybody's messed up

I can't tell what's wrong or right
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
In over my head[/tab]

You keep saying it's just a hard time
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
I'm the one who's messed up[/tab]

If only I could take it back


[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
In over my head[/tab]

I keep saying it's just a rough patch
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
Everybody's messed up[/tab]

I can't tell what's wrong or right
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
In over my head[/tab]

You keep saying it's just a hard time
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
I'm the one who's messed up[/tab]

If only I could take it back
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
In over my head[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
In over my[/tab]

Everybody's messed up[/tab]

I can't tell what's wrong or right

I'm the one who's messed up[/tab]

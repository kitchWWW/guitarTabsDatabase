B.A. Johnston - Have Fun On Warped Tour

[ch]C[/ch]-[ch]G[/ch]-[ch]D[/ch]-[ch]A[/ch] (2 string power chords)


have fun on warped tour
ba-aa-aa-by willy
will he take off his wrist bands when he
holds you in his mom's car?

cool rock and roll bullet belts
cool rock and roll hair cuts
and as usual no one to blame but myself
cause it's all my fault

i've ben replaced by a 23 year old emo fuck-ball
and it burns me worse than wedgies burned my early ancestors
when will i learn not to trust myself when every instinct is wrong
dont wanna see you with that pinhead on your arm

better burn your cds ceedee-ees see-dee-ee-ee-eez
and watch the extreme games on teevee-ee ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee

cool tony hawk video games
enough pot to keep you dazed
and as usual no one to blame but myself
cause it's all my fault

i've ben replaced by a 23 year old emo fuck-ball
and it burns me worse than wedgies burned my early ancestors
when will i learn not to trust (fade) myself when every instinct is wrong
dont wanna see you with that pinhead on your arm

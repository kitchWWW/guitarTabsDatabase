[Intro]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
     He knocked it off, knocked it off[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
     He knocked it off, knocked it off[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Some of us have talent, some of us just haven't[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Some are super sensitive like Mr Spock[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Chose my vocation, took a little application[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I'm an overnight sensation, The King of rock[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Available for parties, Bar Mitzvahs and charities[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Do another session, I'll be carried off[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I have my creativity, thank God, my sensitivity[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You know I really love my art (We think you are a boring)[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Knocked it off, you know I knocked it off[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]                            [ch]Bb[/ch]
While I was sitting in the corner with my tracksuit off[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bb[/ch]
I was hopin' I'd be playin'[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]Dm[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch]
But I never thought I'd be winnin' the game[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
You knocked it off. Yeah, I knocked it off[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]                                [ch]Bb[/ch]
While I was standing on the goalline when the ball got crossed[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
I thought I'd have a go and shoot it[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
But I never thought I'd put it away[/tab]

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
     He knocked it off, knocked it off[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
     He knocked it off, knocked it off[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
I made meself a million, had my house painted vermillion[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
But I'm still the same civilian, even talk to me pop.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I'm happy to be playin', what's that you're sayin'?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
There's got to be a limo to take me down the shops[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
So they can stuff it, I'm not about to rough it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
In some Granada Ghia, I was top of the pops[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Pop folk are fickle and they get a little tickle[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And they get a little sick when they get a little flop.[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Knocked it off, you know I knocked it off[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]Dm[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch]
But I never thought I'd be winnin' the game[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]

[Middle 8]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
      To Maharajahs and kings show the door[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
      Cause my Gucci parking place is secure[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
      Buy a diamante personalised number plate, sure[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
He's going to have a crash, just scatter cash.[/tab]

     He knocked it off, knocked it off[/tab]

People the time has come, in this land[/tab]
When lion must, lay down with the lamb
Brothers and sisters, live side by side
Hold on to love, let its light be your guide
My people!

[Verse 2]
The lord god said, love me one another
Who ever does the will of the father, is my brother 
The hawk must fall, let the dove fly high 
Hold on to love, let its light be your guide 
My people!

[Verse 3]
In peace, let us trust
Before we turn to ashes and dust
Let us all stand together
I realize our hearts are tried
I can see the struggle in your eyes
My people!

My people... hold on! (My people!)
My people... hold on! (My my my my my my my)

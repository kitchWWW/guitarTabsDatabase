[Verse 1]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
In the forest of my mind[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
I let you shine, I let you shine[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]
You were a candle in the mist[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]
Like there was no other light[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
But the times are passing by[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
And you become a stranger now[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]
Although I wanted something more[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]
I'll stand and watch the stars alone[/tab]

[Bridge]
[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]

[Verse 2]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
In the forest of my mind[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
I see you become so different now[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
And it is hard to realize[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
The things you're hiding in your heart[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
In another space and time[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
I think we could become as one[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]
But now the end is coming close[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]        
And I have no strength to try[/tab]

[Bridge]
[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]

[Verse 3]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch] 
Even though I'm feeling down[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
I have a need to write you down[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
All the things I felt for you[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
All my feelings were so true[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
But there is no need to try[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
To find a path to walk on by[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
I should forget about you now[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
And I should start to look around[/tab]

[Bridge]
[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]

[Verse 4]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
There must be another light[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Another chance for me to try[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
Another feeling more secure[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
I have no more time to waste[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
For another pointless night[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
For the pleasures of my life[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
For some empty carnal thoughts[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
Just a cum and nothing more[/tab]

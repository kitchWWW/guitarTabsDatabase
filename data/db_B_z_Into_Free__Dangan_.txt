[Intro]
[ch]B[/ch] [ch]C#[/ch] [ch]D#[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]
Today I woke and looked outside again[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#[/ch]
But the sky looked the same to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Something told me that this world had changed[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#[/ch]
Couldn't figure out what did it mean[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]G#m[/ch]                          [ch]A#m[/ch]
Some say to get out fast, looks like it's gonna last[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D#m[/ch]
Get all your things and fly (DON'T LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND)[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G#m[/ch]             [ch]A#m[/ch]
Some said it'll be OK, just go ahead and stay[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D#[/ch]
Be sure to drink your iodine[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]C#[/ch]            [ch]D#[/ch]
The wind is pushing me, into the clouds again[/tab]

I feel the blood in my veins
[tab][ch]B[/ch]               [ch]C#[/ch]                  [ch]D#[/ch]
Time is running free, I feel like letting go[/tab]

Just like the Dangan

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
Staring out to the hourglass inside[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C#[/ch]
My mind is racing and wild[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Blinded by eyes that cover up the facts[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#[/ch]
Uncertainty with all the cracks in a smile[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
[tab]               [ch]G#m[/ch]                       [ch]A#m[/ch]
I'm breathing life or death, are we making progress?[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D#m[/ch]
Not really sure this time (THE CHOICE IS YOURS AND MINE)[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G#m[/ch]                   [ch]A#m[/ch]
Not sure what to do next, no real test reflex[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D#m[/ch]
Can't touch or see with my own eyes[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]             [ch]C#[/ch]             [ch]D#[/ch]
The wave is pushing me, into the current again[/tab]

I feel the blood in my veins
[tab] [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]C#[/ch]                 [ch]D#[/ch]
Time is running free, I feel like letting go[/tab]

Nothing to slow me down
[tab] [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]C#[/ch]             [ch]D#[/ch]
Dragon inside of me, I feel it letting go[/tab]

I can't hear not a sound
[tab] [ch]B[/ch]           [ch]C#[/ch]             [ch]D#[/ch]
Flying into free, I hit the mother lode[/tab]

I am the Dangan

[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]             [ch]C#[/ch]             [ch]D#[/ch]
The wave is pushing me, into the current again[/tab]

I feel the blood in my veins
[tab] [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]C#[/ch]                 [ch]D#[/ch]
Time is running free, I feel like letting go[/tab]

Nothing to slow me down
[tab] [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]C#[/ch]             [ch]D#[/ch]
Dragon inside of me, I feel it letting go[/tab]

I can't hear not a sound
[tab] [ch]B[/ch]           [ch]C#[/ch]             [ch]D#[/ch]
Flying into free, I hit the mother lode[/tab]

I am the Dangan

[Outro]
Flying
Flying
Flying
Flying into free
Flying into free

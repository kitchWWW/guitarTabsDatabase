Twas late December the news came[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
And I got so excited, I cried all day[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]
And you were such a lovely, precious sight[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
When I saw our baby in your eyes[/tab]

[tab]                                [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
             It was like falling deep in love[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
             I heard the angels cry above[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
             I felt a blessing straight from God[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
            The day that you gave me a son[/tab]


I called 'bout everyone I knew
Just think, I'll be a father 'cause of you
There's no greater love than what you gave
A brand new baby on the way

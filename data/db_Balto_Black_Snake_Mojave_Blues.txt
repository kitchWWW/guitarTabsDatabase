[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
With the edge of the Mojave curling up into the fire[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
The highway is a black snake, the back of which I ride[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
I can feel the city breathing out over the rise[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
But the engine coughs and shudders, I think the dream’s about to die[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
With the final mile stretched out, the needle met the dash[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]*  
I ran hard upon a promise but I couldn’t make it last[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Well, I swore there on the hood with the skyline below[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
That I’d walk among the failures, shipwrecked sailors, and their gold[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
The undiscovered genius, the thousand secret songs[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
The million dollar smiles getting tired, getting old[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
Hey there, baby, don’t you look so sad[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]*
The sun is just a big star running out of g-g-g-gas[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Warning to the saints not to look into the lights[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
Nothing there to save you when you’ve sold it to the night[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
Pawn whatever’s left to lose beneath the palms[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
For every fire burning, there’s an ocean in the dark[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
In the dark[/tab]
 N.C.
Yeah-eah-eah


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Burnouts on the blacktop, restless in the heat[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Leather under leather, empty veins, and busted strings[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Nebraska girl, no longer checking groceries, saving tips[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
She’s a shadow 'neath the shadow of a phone that never rings[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
Call the number at the bottom of that faded billboard sign[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
If you start to get too lonely and you need someone to change your mind[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Well, you ghosts that never made it, take your seats behind the bar[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Sing your karaoke music in the space between the stars[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Just a small town girl, supersonic rocket man[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Tell me all about your pain, tell me all about your plans[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
All you television spirits, can I buy y’all a round?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I’ve played every dive in Portland but I’m kinda new in town[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
Warning to the saints not to look into the lights[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
Nothing there to save you when you’ve sold it to the night[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Pawn whatever’s left to lose beneath the palms[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
For every fire burning, there’s an ocean in the dark[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
In the dark[/tab]
N.C.
Whoaaa




[Outro]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
With the edge of the Mojave curling up into the fire[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
The highway is a black snake, the back of which I ride[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
I can feel the city breathing out over the rise[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
But the engine coughs and shudders, I think the dream’s about to die[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
With the final mile stretched out, the needle met the dash[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
I ran hard upon a promise but I couldn’t make it[/tab]

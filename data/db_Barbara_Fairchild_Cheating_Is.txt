[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Cheating is a thing that starts when you bring[/tab]

[tab]                                                [ch]F[/ch]
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss[/tab]

[tab][ch]G7[/ch]
She blames him he blames her[/tab]

[tab]                                                       [ch]C[/ch]
But neither one is ever quite sure which way it really is[/tab]


[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
And all of the time in the back of their minds[/tab]

[tab]                                                       [ch]C[/ch]
They know they're gonna have to lie bout where they've been[/tab]


Cheating is a thing that'll take a little ring

[tab]    [ch]G7[/ch]                                             [ch]C[/ch]
And break it into pieces that'll never go together again[/tab]



Cheating is the part of loving that starts

[tab]                                             [ch]F[/ch]
When true love isn't what lovers are looking for[/tab]

[tab][ch]G7[/ch]
A stranger here a stranger there then you turn around and swear[/tab]

[tab]                              [ch]C[/ch]
That you'll never go back for more[/tab]


[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
And lying at night when you're holding him tight[/tab]

[tab]                                                [ch]C[/ch]
Is sometimes that a cheater's heart just has to learn[/tab]


Cheating is a thing that's guaranteed to bring

[tab]    [ch]G7[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
Two unhappy people to the point of no return[/tab]


[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
The worst of cheating is the sad little kids[/tab]

[tab]                                            [ch]C[/ch]
Hanging in the middle while mommy and daddy choose[/tab]


Cheating is a game where nobody wins

[tab]        [ch]G7[/ch]                                                   [ch]C[/ch]
And the ones that aren't big enough to play are the ones who lose[/tab]

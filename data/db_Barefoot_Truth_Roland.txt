   I got a friend and I need him, but he's so far away[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]Em[/ch]
Because he's friends with the needle and it's always there to play[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
He's got no one left to follow, he just goes his own way[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
And when today turns into tomorrow well tomorrow looks a lot like today[/tab]

 But when you look inside yourself would you wish that I was near?[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Dsus4[/ch]
Or would you wish that I was by your side?[/tab]

 When the stars have all come out will the horizon still be clear?[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Dsus4[/ch]
Or will you look at me through - clouded skies?[/tab]

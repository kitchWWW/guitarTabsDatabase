[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                                                
I get a bit sentimental, right around closing time,[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                                                   
And I find myself on the phone, looking for a dime.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]                                        
I know I shouldn't call her, but I don't really have a choice.[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]                                                   
I'll use up all my dignity to hear that pretty voice.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]                                                  
"Well how ya doin' darlin'?  You know it's been a long time[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]                                                   
You've been on my mind.  Do you miss me baby?"[/tab]
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]                                                                                                                                                           
She said "Don't talk about yesterday,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]                                                                      
don't tell me it was better back then.[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]                                                                     
Don't talk about the good old days.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]                                                      
It'll never be that way again."[/tab]
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                                                                                                                                           
She don't like to remember back when life was fun.[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                                                 
We'd go out dancin' and come home with therisin' sun.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]                                                   
And now she's goin', she's goin' back to school.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]                                                 
She's got these crazy dreams, but this boy can't enjoy[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                                                                                   
 being part of that scene.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                                                    
So I told her "Darlin', you know it's been a mistake[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]                                                       
for us to separate.  How I miss you baby."[/tab]
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]                                                                                                                                                           
She said "Don't talk about yesterday,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]                                                                      
don't tell me it was better back then.[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]                                                                     
Don't talk about the good old days.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]                                                      
It'll never be that way again."[/tab]
                                                                                          
                                                                                         
[Bridge]
                                                                                          
And now the band is playin' slow, I like to sing along.
                                                                                          
It's that old George Jones tune, it used to be our favorite song.
                                                                                          
Yeah I know...

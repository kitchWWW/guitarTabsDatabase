I couldn't sleep last night cause I tried to forget you[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Db/F[/ch]          [ch]Ab7[/ch]    [ch]Bbm7[/ch]
In the suffocated air   I resolved to let you go[/tab]

[tab][ch]Db/F[/ch]              [ch]Ab7[/ch]       [ch]Bbm7[/ch]
Twisted all our dreams 'til you became the nightmare[/tab]

[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]               [ch]Ab[/ch]             [ch]Bbm7[/ch]
Close it off inside or else the hurt is gonna rise...[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]Db/F[/ch]               [ch]Ab7[/ch]           [ch]Bbm7[/ch]
Heard the old man and the sea   singing low[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Db/F[/ch]              [ch]Ab7[/ch]         [ch]Bbm7[/ch]   
And the silver fir she cried never forget had gone and died[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Gb[/ch]                     [ch]Ab[/ch]            [ch]Bbm7[/ch]

[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]                            
Still I'm holding out my hand    [/tab]

[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]                        
Standing by my haunted man[/tab]

[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]                               [ch]Ab[/ch]
Yes, your ghosts have got me too[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]Bbm[/ch]
But it's me and you[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Gb[/ch]
I can't run...[/tab]

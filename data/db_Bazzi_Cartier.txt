[Verse 1]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
And that's the thing[/tab]

That thing right there

That's my girl, I can't share
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
Maybe I'm selfish, I get a little jealous[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
I lose my mind when you say that[/tab]

Balmain silk slip off your back
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
You get so impatient[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
I know you got your cravings[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
So tell me you didn't tell all of your girlfriends about this (yeah)[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
Tell me you still think my neighbors don't know, girl, you shout it (yeah)[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
Girl, I know that you've been trying, I swear I'm the proudest (yeah)[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                                                                    [ch]E[/ch]
But the question is, girl, do you think you could live without it? (Without it)[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Nothing on you when you naked[/tab]

Except a Cartier bracelet
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]
Silhouette through the shower[/tab]

Fuck you 24 hours
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Sun peeking through the curtains[/tab]

Know I'm with you when you're hurting
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]
Baby girl, the world's ours[/tab]

Fuck you 24 hours

Got a pretty little heart, I don't wanna break it[/tab]

Girl, I just want to save you

Swear to God, thank the Lord every day that he made you
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
All the girls tryna flex, they don't phase you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]A[/ch]

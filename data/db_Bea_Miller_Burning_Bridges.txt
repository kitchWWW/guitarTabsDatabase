[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch] 
I've been lonely, missing your body[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You've been out of touch, you're so far away[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Wishing you would tell me you're sorry[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And you know you made a big mistake[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Close my eyes and try to forget you[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Every time I do, I just see your face[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And after all this shit that we've been through[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Why are you so willing to walk away?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
I don't know why I stick around to watch you burn our bridges down[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I can't help it that I need you [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
I can't help it that I need you [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
Now I'm drowning underneath the water that was under me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I'm still screaming that I need you [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I can't help it that I need you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
Burn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
Burn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down, down[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
You left me with a craving I can't fill[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Got me wondering what I had yesterday[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Tell everyone I'm fine, but I'm still[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]Em[/ch]
Sitting here, choking on the aftertaste[/tab]

[Pre-chorus]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Ooooooh[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]                      
Can't stay away from you, I try, I try[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Ooooooh[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
But you got a grip on my mind[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
I don't know why I stick around to watch you burn our bridges down[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I can't help it that I need you [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
I can't help it that I need you [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
Now I'm drowning underneath the water that was under me[/tab]

I can't help it that I need you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
Burn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]

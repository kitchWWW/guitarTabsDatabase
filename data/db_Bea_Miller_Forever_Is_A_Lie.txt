[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
This whole thing started so that fathers could sell daughters like property[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
But I never had a father and I couldn't be his daughter so lucky me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D#[/ch]
The only thing I'm sellin' are songs[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
But nobody buys those no more[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Marriage is a contract 'cause they know that it's another liability[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
You cut through my legs, through my heart just to get another piece of me (Piece of me)[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D#[/ch]
The only thing I'm servin' are facts[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
But nobody wants those no more[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Hey (Oh-oh, mmm)[/tab]

Is that it's a fucking lie, but I'll lovе you for tonight[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
Say with time that it gets bettеr[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D#[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I've been tryna wean myself off people who are heteronormative[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
And we should be arrested 'cause we're saying words like that in pop music[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D#[/ch]
The only things I'm sayin' are facts[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]
But nobody wants those no more[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]Em[/ch] - [ch]G[/ch] - [ch]D[/ch] - [ch]G[/ch] - [ch]A[/ch] - [ch]Bm[/ch] - [ch]A[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]Db[/ch]
 After school I always had to work, It kinda left me feeling like a jerk.[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
 Cause I never got to talk to the guy I liked, and that ain't right.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]                                         [ch]Db[/ch]
 And then he met another type, made him buy her all the things she liked.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
 I learned a lot about life, when she jumped in his convertible.[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
 Singin' oh la da da da, without a care in the world,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch] 
 Oh la da da da I'm not that kind of girl.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
 Rich kids got a lot to say, rich kids never have to pay. [/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                                                    [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
 Everything's funny when you're young with money, and mommy and daddy will pay the way.[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
 Rich kids never go to jail, rich kids never buy on sale, rich kids always have the most fun.[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch] 
 Man I wish that I was one.[/tab]

 A little later on in life, when I finally get my money right,[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
 it's still never enough, for the stuck up types.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
 They say my money's new, and she's got a better view,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch] 
 as they sail away on their fathers yacht, this is what I got.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
 Oh la da da da, without a care in the world,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
 Oh la da da da, I'm not that kinda girl.[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
 Maybe he saved me some trouble down the line, but maybe they're just like me.[/tab]

[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
And so I go to this party downtown[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]               [ch]Cm[/ch]

[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
Couple hours in you're not around and the music's too loud[/tab]

Shit I'm on my own again
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
People 'round me I don't know anyone there[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                        [ch]Cm[/ch]
Red cup in every hand and marijuana's in the air[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb[/ch]                                                       [ch]Bb[/ch]

[tab]                                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]

[tab]                             [ch]Cm[/ch]                  [ch]Eb[/ch]

[tab]                                                [ch]Bb[/ch]
Some kid just threw up all I wanna do is leave (All I wanna do is leave)[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Eb[/ch]

[tab]                                             [ch]Bb[/ch]
More people 'round me and there's no way out (No way out)[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Cm[/ch]                  [ch]Eb[/ch]
I guess I'm stuck so I just pull my phone out[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
But when I listen to your voicemail, God I know that sound[/tab]

[tab]                                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                            [ch]Cm[/ch]                         [ch]Eb[/ch]
You can ask me where I am but baby what about you and I[/tab]

Know she tells you that she's fallin' for you
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Yeah we both know the truth[/tab]

Shit I'm on my own again
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
I've got the feelin that you're never gonna change[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                              [ch]Cm[/ch]
What we have is quickly sinkin' and there's nothin' left to save[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb[/ch]                                        [ch]Bb[/ch]

'Cause I'm on my own again
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                                                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
But there's somebody and he's right across the room[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                    [ch]Cm[/ch]

[tab]                                                     [ch]Bb[/ch]
I couldn't tell you which of us made the first move (Which of us made the first move)[/tab]

I'm so far gone from loneliness
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                                               [ch]Bb[/ch]
I guess I'm here and there's no backin' out now (Backin' out now)[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Cm[/ch]
It's gettin' heated we move deeper in the house[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
You did this shit first you don't get to call me out[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bb[/ch]

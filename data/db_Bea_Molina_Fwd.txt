[tab][ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]                          [ch]F#[/ch]
In a year none of this is gonna be the same[/tab]

We're never gonna be this young and dumb ever again
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]F#[/ch]
I'm thinkin' 'bout this and it's all a little overwhelmin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]B[/ch]
I'm just a girl who's tryna give her life to make a change[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
Doin' my best to live and take everything day by day[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]F#[/ch]
It sometimes feels like no one's listenin'[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]                      [ch]F#[/ch]
But if I wake up right then that's a W[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]E[/ch]
If the circle's tight and I'm here with you[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]B[/ch]                            [ch]F#[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]
Then it's all good what the hell have we got to lose[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]B[/ch]                                 [ch]F#[/ch]
I know wе'll be alright sometimes I doubt that truth[/tab]
[tab]                                              [ch]E[/ch]
I stay up somе nights I know you do that too[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]B[/ch]                   [ch]F#[/ch]
If we keep goin' what the hell have we got to lose[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]B[/ch]                        [ch]F#[/ch]
We gotta keep movin' forward or we'll never know how good life gets[/tab]

I guess they're right
[tab]                                [ch]E[/ch]
You gotta live with no regrets[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]B[/ch]                            [ch]F#[/ch]
Isn't it crazy how nobody knows how much time's left[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                              [ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]F#[/ch]
We gotta keep lookin' forward 'cause we never know how good we'll get[/tab]

Can you imagine livin' this dope life full of regrets
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]F#[/ch]

You ever feel like things were better in the old days[/tab]

You should've treasured them a little more and you're to blame
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]                    [ch]F#[/ch]

In my experience overthinkin' makes me feel myself fade[/tab]
[tab]                                               [ch]E[/ch]
There's no point can't tell the future anyway[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]F#[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
No need to make this life anymore overwhelmin'[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                    [ch]B[/ch]                       [ch]F#[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]
If I had known that it was gonna end the way it did[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
That we’d be hiding all our pain behind defensiveness[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
I would’ve never let you walk out[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
To cry until your colors were all washed out[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
If I had known that we’d be judged no matter what we’d say[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]
That we wouldn’t be in touch and stop talking everyday[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Oh I wouldn’t have put my friends over you[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]Am[/ch]
I would’ve done my best to try to work it out with you[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 1]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
Things got blown out of proportion baby[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]Am[/ch]
I don’t do well with emotions it comes off as shady[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
To be forced on separate sides and then told to blame each othеr[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]Am[/ch]
Shit will leave you paralyzed nothing еlse to do but suffer[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]
And that’s what we did[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
No one is to blame we’re just a couple of kids[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
Running out of energy[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
This is our sign we weren’t meant to be[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
If I had known[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]
If I had done something more[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
Maybe then our hearts wouldn’t have been shred and torn to bits[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
No, oh[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
If I had known[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]
If I had done something more[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
Maybe then my heart wouldn’t have slipped down a hole like this[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
If I had known[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
If you had known that I was hurt and going through it too[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
I had to plan my future while going to school[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
Would you have seen my absence as a cry of help[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Would you have read my text to look beyond yourself[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
If you had known it'd be way bigger than it ever should've[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
If you had seen that I was scared as fuck to ever lose us[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
Would you have maybe asked me what I really thought[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Would you have maybe called me before all was lost[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 2]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
Baby we were bleeding you can’t call that love[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
Doesn’t matter who did what with all the damage done[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
We were forced on separate sides and then told to blame each other[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]Am[/ch]
Shit it left us paralyzed nothing else to do but suffer[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]
And that’s what we did[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]

The first track off Beach Slang's first EP "Who Would Ever Want Anything So Broken?" which came out on

Verse:
      Ab              Eb      Db
I’m a slave to always fucking up.
         Ab              Eb     Db
It’s not okay, but maybe it’s enough.
          Ab                Eb          Db
Kids like us are weird, and more, we’re brave.
           Ab                    Eb   Db
We tie our tongues and turn them into rage.

chorus:
        Eb            Db
And the night’s still young. 
          Eb        Db
And we’re dumb enough to fall.

Verse 2:
           Ab           Eb      Db
Carve your name, soft across my lungs
        Ab              Eb     Db
I wanna breathe, you until I'm numb
          Ab            Eb        Db
We’re not loved, well, hardly, anyway,
            Ab                Eb   Db
With filthy luck in such a filthy haze.

Chorus
        Eb            Db
And the night’s still young. 
          Eb        Db
And we’re dumb enough to fall.

   Is there a lie in the lights or the shine of this town?

Db (once)
This guitar wants to die.

[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                    [ch]A5[/ch]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
Woke up this morning, I was late, off out on the dark side, [/tab]
[tab][ch]A5[/ch]                                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
With the moon and the room on the wrong side. [/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                    [ch]A5[/ch]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
I took a needle for myself right back at the seams, [/tab]
[tab][ch]A5[/ch]                                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
I saw my universal gleam. [/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                    [ch]A5[/ch]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
I see the wonder of life and look for the wall, [/tab]
[tab][ch]A5[/ch]                                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
Taking a walk in the sun. [/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                    [ch]A5[/ch]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
In time, in just a second like the ghost of a bad idea, [/tab]
[tab][ch]A5[/ch]                                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
I feel myself getting the fear. [/tab]

[ch]C#m[/ch] [ch]A5[/ch] [ch]F#m[/ch] [ch]A5[/ch] [ch]F#m[/ch]

[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                    [ch]A5[/ch]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
Come on, have we decided if we like being part of the plan.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A5[/ch]                                                 [ch]F#m[/ch] 
It sends us shifting and there’s nowhere to land [/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                    [ch]A5[/ch]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
It’s on; it doesn’t matter if all of these tickets are sold [/tab]
[tab][ch]A5[/ch]                                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
And all the old stories are told [/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                    [ch]A5[/ch]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
I know you’re gonna tell me that you hear every word I say [/tab]
[tab][ch]A5[/ch]                                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
But the future gets written today; [/tab]
[tab][ch]A5[/ch]                                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
Yeah the future gets written today. [/tab]

[Spoken Word: Same chord progression]
Don’t be deceived when our revolution has been finally stamped out and they pat 
you eternally on the shoulder and say that there’s no inequality worth speaking of 
and no more reason for fighting because if you believe them they will be 
completely in charge in their marble homes and granite banks from which they rob 
the people of the world under the pretense of bringing them culture. 


Watch out, for as soon as it pleases them they’ll send you out to protect their 
gold in wars whose weapons, rapidly developed by servile scientists, will become 
more and more deadly until they can with a flick of the finger tear a million of 
you to pieces

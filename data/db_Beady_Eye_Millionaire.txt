[tab][ch]C7[/ch]                                      [ch]F[/ch] 
Sweet can it guess to figure as a forty minute ride[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C7[/ch]
You drive it and I'll spend it looking out my window[/tab]
[tab][ch]C7[/ch]                                               [ch]F[/ch]
Sweet sound the door the shadows painted and the light he saw[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]C7[/ch]
The way I'm seeing now so clear, like diamonds on the water[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]
A medal with me and you'll meddle with yourself[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Dm[/ch]
For there is a higher wealth[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C7[/ch]
Love them like a millionaire[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch] 
Medals on your premonition rags[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
You just need to know yourself[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C7[/ch]
And love them like a millionaire[/tab]

[tab][ch]C7[/ch]                                     [ch]F[/ch] 
Her faded glamour out of season as the ages pass[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C7[/ch]    
Desperate for inspiration as the months run down like rain[/tab]
[tab][ch]C7[/ch]                                
Sweet sound the door I stood outside your door[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]C7[/ch]
And saw the light out shining in the summer the way the light shines out the water[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]Dm[/ch] 
 Like a lover, like a lover, like a lover[/tab]

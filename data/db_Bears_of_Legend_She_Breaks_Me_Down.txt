She came here a few days ago, and told me with all that she knows[/tab]
[tab][ch]E9[/ch]                                              [ch]F#m/C#[/ch] 
that she'd like to hear how pretty she could sound.[/tab]

[tab][ch]F#m/C#[/ch]                          [ch]A9[/ch]
They might say she's one of a kind, but mostly she's kind of the one.[/tab]
[tab][ch]E9[/ch]                                      [ch]F#m/C#[/ch] 
I'll have to store my feelings in a box[/tab]

And just as I give up the fight, of searching perfections around[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                       [ch]F#m[/ch]
she comes in with that fresh air I had missed[/tab]

[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
Those liars and sinners you met, should no more be part of your head.[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                       [ch]F#m[/ch]
It's easy you're too smily to be sad[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]F#m[/ch]
and you break me down, you break me down[/tab]

It's always too late that I figure out.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]F#m[/ch]
There's someone misleading us, let's never mind.[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]F#m[/ch]

[tab]                [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]F#m[/ch]

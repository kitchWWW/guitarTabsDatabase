[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                                          [ch]Bm7[/ch]
You've taken keys back cleaned out bedside drawers[/tab]
[tab]                                               [ch]G[/ch]
Every bar in town's seen you walk through the door[/tab]

On the phone askin' why to your mama
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
Too much drama[/tab]

But let me tell you boy

You did when you fell in it for the first time[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Em7[/ch]
Back before you knew what lonely was[/tab]

Breaking up all the stuff

You don't need to worry 'bout anymore[/tab]

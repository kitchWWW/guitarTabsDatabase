[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Little bird, little bird[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
Don’t build your nest in his hands[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Little bird, little bird[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Little bird, fly away while you can[/tab]


[Verse 1]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
He says he wants the best for you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Would struggle to the death for you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]Em[/ch]
He seems to be the answer to your prayers[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
But, girl, there’s something in his eyes[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
A poison that he can’t disguise[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]Em[/ch]
If I were you, I’d get on outta there[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Little bird, little bird[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
Don’t build your nest in his hands[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Little bird, little bird[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Little bird, fly away while you can[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
You warble and you sing so sweet[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
A favorite with the folks you meet[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]Em[/ch]
They come to hear your songs from far and wide[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
You’re tempted by that diamond ring[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
Sure enough, he’ll clip your wings[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
As soon as you accept to be his bride[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Little bird, little bird[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
Don’t build your nest in his hands[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Little bird, little bird[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Little bird, fly away while you can[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Now, maybe he’s your only one[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
And all these fears will come undone[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
Quite possibly, it all could turn out right[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
But “to thine own self be true”[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
Before you ever say “I do”[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]Em[/ch]
Regret can make it hard to sleep at night[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Little bird, little bird[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
Don’t build your nest in his hands[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Little bird, little bird[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Little bird, fly away while you can[/tab]

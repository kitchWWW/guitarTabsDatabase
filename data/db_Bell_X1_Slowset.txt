[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
So I asked her to dance[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]
She said she wasn't able[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
And all her friends laughed[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]
She was just trying to be gentle[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
And so we danced[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]
Round and round in circles[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Not of that lovesong[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]
But our very own circles[/tab]


[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
Slowset is dead[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
No more love on the dancefloor[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Unless you're out of your head[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
That's all that we went for[/tab]


[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
So she asked me to dance[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]
I did but I wasn't able[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Oh where to put your hands[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]F[/ch]
When there's so much food on the table[/tab]


[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
Slowset is dead[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]
No more love on the dancefloor[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]C[/ch]
Unless you're out of your head..[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]
That's all that we went for[/tab]


[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
What do you say[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
When she's in your arms and you're going round in those circles...[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
What do you say[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
When both of you know that you've risen to the occasion...[/tab]
          NC
What do you say

When her friend comes along and you know that she's been rescued...

When you're eternal flame has been drowned by her...

Purple rain                       Purple Rain[/tab]

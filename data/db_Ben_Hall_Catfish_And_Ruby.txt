[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
He was a shrimper out of San Leon bad language and bad teeth[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
He had an oyster shell exterior even rougher underneath[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
The deckhands called him captain the new comers called him stew[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
The old salts called him catfish by the way his whiskers grew[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
Tattoo on a sunburned arm said Ruby in a black heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                            [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
Sometimes he’d wake up sweating and yell that name out in the dark[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
She came down from Corpus Christi part woman part child[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                                          [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
And the way she moved could take your breath and it drove the rednecks wild[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Beauty and pain are fleeting[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
They get washed to the sea[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
Storms swell like Satan only God can wash you clean[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]
Catfish could not help himself and Ruby was not free[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
He didn’t see her for what she was but what he wanted her to be[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
He never answered questions about the future or the past[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]
Just another shot of whiskey saying nothing ever lasts[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
The warnings had come early and the morning looked like blood[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
The birds were wild and nervous like before the last big flood[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Everybody stared to the sea it took their breath[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Clouds grew dark and ominous looked like danger looked like death[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Beauty and pain are fleeting[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
They get washed to the sea[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
Storms swell like Satan only God can wash you clean[/tab]
 
[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
Catfish started drinking like a hundred times before[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
You ain’t going to get me this time he said you dirty whore[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
He’d rode out every single storm that ever hit the coast[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
But the worst storm raged inside him and haunted like a ghost[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
They all started boarding up the windows nothing new[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
But this one felt different and the storm clouds sailed steel blue[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
I’m going to ride her out right here this boats my ball and chain[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
Damn storm named Ruby ain’t no bitch I can’t tame[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Beauty and pain are fleeting[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
They get washed to the sea[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
Storms swell like Satan only God can wash you clean[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
By the next morning it looked like a bad dream[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
Somebody said that late that night they heard somebody scream[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
The tide receded slowly and revealed the sunken wreck[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
Bow lines still tied to the dock holes pounded through the deck[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]
Down below what they found is still talked about today[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]
Catfish sitting dead as life his skin all wet gray[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
And when they came to take him they sounded the alarm[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
The tattoo that said Ruby had all but vanished from his arm[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Beauty and pain are fleeting[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
They get washed to the sea[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
Storms swell like Satan only God washes you clean[/tab]

tried to make this easier to understand by separating it into a base pattern and an 
ending pattern that is only played sometimes. Make sure to pay attention to how many times 
each part of the pattern is played at the end of each bar.

Recently I've realised as I have stood atop my stage
looking at the rows of faces, I think I'm filled with twisted rage
it's taken me 'till 9pm one rainy Saturday in June to realize

This is the way I feel now, and it's taken me so long to see
that the words you hang off on, are never really the feelings of me.

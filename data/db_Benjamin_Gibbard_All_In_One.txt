All in One
Words and music by Jay Farrar and Benjamin Gibbard from the album “One Fast Move Or I’m Gone”

Cliffs of [ [ch]G[/ch] ] antique ain’t got no [ [ch]C[/ch] ]rose
The [ [ch]D[/ch] ]mornings seen the ledder [ [ch]C[/ch] ]pose
Say [ [ch]G[/ch] ]thanks to foggy [ [ch]C[/ch] ]moon
Ex [ [ch]D[/ch] ] cept when [ [ch]C[/ch] ]tumble [ [ch]G[/ch] ]boom
Soon and sand crook bird [ [ch]C[/ch] ] back
Long and [ [ch]D[/ch] ]short low and [ [ch]C[/ch] ] easy
See [ [ch]G[/ch] ]round see the end of [ [ch]C[/ch] ]me
To find the [ [ch]D[/ch] ] other side of [ [ch]G[/ch] ]flat

All the way to [ [ch]Cadd9[/ch] ] heaven
All in [ [ch]G[/ch] ] one
I’m gonna [ [ch]D[/ch] ] wash old Pavia down
And pack my salt to an [ [ch]Cadd9[/ch] ]other [ [ch]G[/ch] ] town

How sweet the earth yells sand
All there is in the fair and sight
Whose plantation Neptune got
That of Atlas still down there
Rough old hands played out pedigree
Sunk more boats than dreamer will ever see
The world is burning and needs water
I’ll have a daughter wait and see

All the way to [ [ch]Cadd9[/ch] ] heaven
All in [ [ch]G[/ch] ] one
I’m gonna [ [ch]D[/ch] ] wash old Pavia down
And pack my salt to an [ [ch]Cadd9[/ch] ]other [ [ch]G[/ch] ] town

All the way to [ [ch]Cadd9[/ch] ] heaven
All in [ [ch]G[/ch] ] one
I’m gonna [ [ch]D[/ch] ] wash Fujiyama down
And pack my salt to an [ [ch]Cadd9[/ch] ]other [ [ch]G[/ch] ] town

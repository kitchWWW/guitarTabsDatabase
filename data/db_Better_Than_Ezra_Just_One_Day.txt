Em                                         C
  If you could change the choices that you made,
          G        D
Would you do it- today?
Em                                      C
  If you could spin the world the other way,
           G        D
Could you do it on faith?
   Am         C     D
If time would stand still,

Chorus
               G                  D
What would you do? What would you say?
   Em                               C
If everyone you loved came back for just one day?
G                    D
How would it feel if every dream came real?
    Em                         C
And all the scars you had fade away

For just one day

Verse
Em                                          C
  Imagine all the times you that could take back
           G             D
What would you have done differently?
Em
Thoughts in your head you never said
      C
Or a heart that you broke and left for dead
   G                                D
If all the pain you had could be released
    Am   C     D
How life flies by.

Chorus
               G                  D
What would you do? What would you say?
   Em                               C
If everyone you loved came back for just one day?
G                    D
How would it feel if every dream came real?
    Em                         C
And all the scars you had fade away

Bridge
             Csus2
For just one day
        Csus2
And the night
        G                  D
All the good times and the fights
        Csus2        Csus2
All the take and the give
        G               D            Am
All the moments that we never got to live
C    D
Ooohhh

   Em                                  C
If all the love and loss you had could heal?

              G     D
For just one day
         Em    C
For just one day

Em                                        C
If you could change the choices that you made,
          G        D
Would you do it- today?

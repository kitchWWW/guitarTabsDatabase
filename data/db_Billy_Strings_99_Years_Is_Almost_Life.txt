[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                                         [ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]A[/ch]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                         [ch]D[/ch]
They sent me to Nashville and cut off my hair[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]

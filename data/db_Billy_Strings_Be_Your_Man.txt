[Verse 1]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Asus2[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
When I got to New York City I was looking for another side of life[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]Asus2[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
And my feet were so damned calloused I could probably walk the edges of a knife[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]Asus2[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
My mistakes had often led me to believe I'd never find an open door[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Asus2[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
now I'm busted flat and broken and I don't know what the hell I'm waiting for[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Asus2[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Some could see that I was stumbling and a couple even stopped to lend a hand[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Asus2[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Most would pass me by and ridicule and failed to recognize a fellow man[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]Asus2[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
Now the wind is growing bitter and the leaves begin to die and start to fall[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Asus2[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
And I wonder if next summer I will even be around this place at all[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
If I could go back to the days when I was young[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
I'd travel the whole world over and then some[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]Asus2[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
And I'd come back to you with an everlasting Lily in my hand[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
And I’d show the world just what it means to me for me to get to be your man[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Asus2[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
On the edges of a fading afternoon I heard a voice within my head[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Asus2[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
And the echoes of forgotten words from all the dusty books I have not read[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]Asus2[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
And I wondered if by chance I should have listened back to what they said in school[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]Asus2[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
It occurred to me I might have been the class clown then but now I’m just a fool[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
If I could go back to the days when I was young[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
I'd travel the whole world over and then some[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]Asus2[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
And I'd come back to you with an everlasting Lily in my hand[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
And I’d show the world just what it means to me for me to get to be your man[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
And I’d show the world just what it means to me for me to get to be your man[/tab]

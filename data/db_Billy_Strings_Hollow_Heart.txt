[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
You move around like running water[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
It seems like you might never settle down[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Well, I spent a lifetime waiting for you[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
While you were runnin' 'round the town[/tab]


[Chorus 1]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
You'll always have a place with me, Dear[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
A place inside this hollow heart of mine[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
But it's all right, my little darling[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Ain't ready to just keep steppin' down the line[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Well, I had a dream that I was dying[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
I was bleeding while the rain was pouring down[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
When you appeared inside my dream, Dear[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
You just left me lyin' on the ground[/tab]


[Chorus 2]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Won't come home and say you're sorry[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
You just come on in and crawl your ass in bed[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
But it's all right, my little darling[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
You're crawling over someone else, instead[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Them pretty eyes are always roving[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
And I guess you never will be true[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
This love of ours is a disaster[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
But I keep holdin' on to you[/tab]


[Chorus 3]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Seasons come and go while waiting[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
And my hollow heart is empty all the time[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
But it's all right, my little Darling[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
And you'd rather just keep steppin' down the line[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
But it's all right, my little Darling[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And you'd rather just keep steppin' down the line[/tab]

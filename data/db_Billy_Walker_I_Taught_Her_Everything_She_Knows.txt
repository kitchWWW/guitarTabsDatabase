[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]F[/ch]
I taught her everything she knows and then what did she do[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]G7[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
She turned to someone else and taught him everything she knew[/tab]

[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
The way to cuddle close and kiss so tenderly[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]G7[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
The words to say the things to do she learned from me[/tab]


[tab]  [ch]C7[/ch]                                         [ch]F[/ch]
I taught her love's all that matters on this earth[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]D7[/ch]                          [ch]G7[/ch]
Now she has left me and what was it all worth[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]
I thought that she'd be true to me but that's the way it goes[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]G7[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
He ought to thank me cause I taught her everything she knows[/tab]


[tab]                                      [ch]F[/ch]

He ought to thank me cause I taught her ev-ery-thing she knows[/tab]

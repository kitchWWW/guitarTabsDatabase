[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Em7[/ch]

[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
But he looks good in leather so I don't give a fuck[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em7[/ch]

[tab]        [ch]Em7[/ch]
Chewin' Juicy Fruit[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]Em[/ch]
And I got that sugar, sugar for his sweet tooth[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And I like the way that we walk the train tracks[/tab]

(verse)
Up and down the river
In a little boat, a little boat
All I need is you and a castle
All made of hope, all made of hope

(verse)
I can walk through the doors of time
Scale any wall and cross any line
I can send any thought to the end of the finger
And burn any knot with a kiss

(chorus)
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you, yes, I do
And I believe in you

(verse)
From the bottom of the root
To the top of the leaf, the top of the leaf
I can drink maple water
Any time I believe, any time I believe

(verse)
I was frozen, I was blowing
In a blade of grass
Of running out of honey
Of living in the past

(chorus)
I believe in you
'Cause I believe in you
I believe in you, yes, I do
I believe in you, yes, I do
I believe in you
'Cause I believe in you
I believe in, I believe in, I believe in you, yeah
I believe in you
Yeah, I believe in you

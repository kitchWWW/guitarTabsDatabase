[tab][ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
K-hole at the Dal√≠[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
Seeing the unknown[/tab]
Well it might have been a molly
'Cause my mind's being blown
Take the escalator to the next floor
Such a strong sedator, now I can't find the door

[tab][ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch] 
You turn around and you don't know where you've been[/tab]
You look up at the glass dome and the room beings to spin
Let's go out and find the ocean 'cause I think we need a swim
Turn around, start it over, let's begin

Like the minis at the Louvre
Spinning down the aisle
And the paintings of the Louvre
Now i'm feeling very smart
Like a 3-D picture, stereo's gone
It's a total light picture, kaleidoscope

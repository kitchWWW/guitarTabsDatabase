Don't fill a spider up with dread[/tab]

Spidey's got powers, he takes all of the cowards
And he kills them dead
But when he was younger, an elder among him messed him in the head
So Peter Parker don't let him mark ya, it's so much darker
Don't let him touch ya, he don't have to stay!

The teacher looked at everyone with a PSA[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
She saw that our hearts were gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
She saw that in everyone![/tab]

Peter Parker's life is so much darker
Better tell him, man
'Cause it's your body, no one's body, but your's anyway

So Peter Parker don't him mark ya, it's so much darker
Don't let him touch ya, he don't have to stay!
Don't fill a spider up with dread
Don't fill a spider up with dread
Don't fill a spider up with dread

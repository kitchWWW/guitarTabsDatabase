Black Stone Cherry - Ghost Of Floyd Collins


Tabbed by: http://www.andreasvockrodt.de


[Intro]

N.C.
Yeah, boy, I sure do. I remember yonder back yonder in the 20's.
N.C.
They said that, Floyd Collins, he'd been caught in that cave, sand cave down there.
N.C.
Once he got down there, he couldn't get out.
N.C.
So they just left him down there and they had the sermon for him right there.
N.C.
He just laid there and died

[Verse]

[tab]    [ch]C#m[/ch]
The hellhounds walking on midnight fire[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C#m[/ch]
The fog rolls in and the creek run higher[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#[/ch]
They saw him standing by the railroad tracks[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m[/ch]
Tonight's the night Old Floyd's coming back[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
Downtown deep in the ground it's where his story stays[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]
Down in mammoth cave[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F#[/ch]             [ch]C#m[/ch]
Is where his body laid[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]                 [ch]C#m[/ch]
Walls came in, life could not be saved[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]
No man-made machine[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#[/ch]                  [ch]C#m[/ch]
Could see the things he'd seen[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]         [ch]G#[/ch]                   [ch]C#m[/ch]
Mr. Collins, he did not die in vain[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab]    [ch]C#m[/ch]
The strangers moved in, brought the circus to town[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C#m[/ch]
You know there's people making money off the man underground[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#[/ch]
Somebody said they wouldn't doing him right[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C#m[/ch]
That's why old Floyd's coming back tonight[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
Downtown deep in the ground it's where his story stays[/tab]

Down in mammoth cave[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F#[/ch]             [ch]C#m[/ch]
Is where his body laid[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]                 [ch]C#m[/ch]
Walls came in, life could not be saved[/tab]

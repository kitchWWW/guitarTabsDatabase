         G(1)
They'll steal your soul’s
               G/F#   Em7(1)      
And turn them into gold
Em7/F#      G(1)      
While the village of them all
            G/F#     Em7(1)
Made cities out of homes


Chorus:
         Em7(3)
But it's you I said               )

Verse 2:
   G(1)
Longing for the wild
      G/F#         Em7(1)
In innocence of a job
Em7/F# G(1)
In the end of a tribe
              G/F#      Em7(1)
And the start of the crimes


Verse 3:
Em7/F#     G(1)
But these blood red skies
     G/F# Em7(1)
Cover my eyes
G/F#        G(1)
From the sleepless nights
       G/F#   G(1)
And a haunted life


Chorus:
        Em7(1)                     
But it's you I said               )

Verse 4:
                 G(1)
Cause there are voices in my head
                     
People screaming you’re not dead
     G/F#   Em7(1)
I’m not sure


Verse 5:
Em7/F#  G(1)
These kingdoms in my veins

Last playing children’s game
     G/F#    G(1)
It’s oh so obscure


Chorus

In the versus, you can hear slight variations of the Em7(1) chord. These are as follows:
[tab]e   [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]B[/ch]   e
0   7   9   7   8  (10)[/tab]
0   7   9   7  (10) 7

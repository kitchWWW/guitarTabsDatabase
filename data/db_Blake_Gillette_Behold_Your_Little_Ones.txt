[tab][ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
Many years ago when Christ was on the earth[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
In the land of Bountiful He came to heal us.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
And I can't forget his touch, tears of joy on His face,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]Csus4[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
As He wept for all of us, so great was our faith.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
Encircled by fire, angels coming down,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
A beautiful choir as we learned from the heavens.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]Bb[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
And I won't forget the words He said to all of us,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bb[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
"My joy is full. Behold, your little ones."[/tab]

[ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]Csus4[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]

[Verse 2]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
He gathered us around His bended knees.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
One by one we felt His hands and the prints on His feet,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
And I can't forget his touch, tears of joy on His face,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]C5[/ch]
As He wept for all of us, so great was our faith.[/tab]

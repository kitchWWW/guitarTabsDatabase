This should be fairly right.  I typed this off the top of my head because it
was from my friend's CD.

(Intro [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]) x2

[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
You spend half the time dreaming and the other half's a lie[/tab]
        [ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
You don't know where you're going and you don't know how to try[/tab]
          [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
You don't really have a best friend but you think that you're in love[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Now all you can remember are the words he used the most[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
Like the "lie" in believe[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
The "I" in deceive[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
The "her" in together[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
The "we" in the weather[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
He said a lot of things I'm sure he meant them at the time[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
But it's not the end of the world[/tab]

([ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch])

[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
Well you didn't see it coming cause you never understood[/tab]
           [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
That there's a time to draw the line when things are going good[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
But you just kept on giving beyond the call of love[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
And he was kind to rob you blind of the pieces of your heart[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Like that part that made you give[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
And the part that made you weak[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
When he would softly kiss you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And tell you that he missed you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
I know it doesn't seem like what I'm going to say is true[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
But it's not the end of the world[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
It's not the end of the line[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
You know there's more to love[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
You know there's more to life[/tab]

And I know there's more to you


[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Well I can't help but think about you in the middle of the night[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
I know it's kinda lonely but you have to win this fight[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
I just wish that I could hold you and tell you it's alright[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
But it's not the end of the world[/tab]

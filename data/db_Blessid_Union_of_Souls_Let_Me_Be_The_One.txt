This is based on the transcription by Alexander Hsi pu Feng
&lt;ahf1@acpub.duke.edu>.  Some of the chords have minor fixes and in the
previous transcription. several key chords were misplaced.  This version
fixes all of these.

The C(9) chord which was previously placed here is actually just a C
chord fingered a bit different.  Also in place of these G Chords should
be a Gmaj7.  Also some C? turned out to be Fs and such.

C      032013
D      x00232
D9     x00230
Dsus   x00233
F      133211  (barre the first fret)
Gmaj7  320002  (or an easier one -> 3x0002).  I prefer this fingering for
               pure simplicity and chord structure.  Chords tend to ring
               better if you have an open fifth at the root instead of
               of a triad.  To finger this correctly, simply use your
               thumb to mute the A string.

One last note before we get started.  In the chorus, the D chord is
jazzed up by doing the following...

    D                          Then the following G chord

[tab]e [-2-------2-----3---2---0-----22--3--]
B [-3-------3-----3---3---3-----33--3--]
G [-2-------2-----2---2---2-----22--2--]
D [------------------------------------]
A [------------------------------------]
E [-x-------x-----x---x---x-----xx--x--][/tab]

Gmaj7                         C
So you're scared to show your feelings
Gmaj7          C
Baby I do understand

And I vow to be a real good friend

[Intro]

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch] 
(hammer-on g string)[/tab]
No lyrics 

[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch]
There are those among us willing[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch] 
To get by on anything[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch] 
Hollow hope of what is coming[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C/G[/ch] 
A lifetime dangled by a string[/tab]

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch] 
But this ocean dives so deeply[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch] 
And this river runs so wide[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
I won't be counted one among them[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C/G[/ch] 
Until my soul is satisfied[/tab]

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch] 
Brick and brick of buried hunger[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch] 
Keeping all desire dark[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch] 
And then we are like lions[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C/G[/ch]
We are tearing it apart[/tab]

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch] 
There are those among us lying[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch] 
Saying nothing is for free[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch] 
And then we are like lions[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C/G[/ch] 
And we will not leave until we eat[/tab]

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch] 
Playing kings and playing peasants[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch] 
Do we get what we are owed[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]   
An eagle comes and talks of failure[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C/G[/ch] 
A rabbit offers up its throat[/tab]

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch] 
Will they buy even our breathing[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch] 
A river strangled by a dam[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch] 
Less than one percent are taken[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C/G[/ch] 
So tell me who dries up this land[/tab]

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch] 
Is it worse to see no future[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch] 
Is it worse to be afraid[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch] 
And then we are like lions[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C/G[/ch] 
Pumping fire in our veins[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]C/G[/ch] 
We are born with a perfect hunger[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
We are born with a perfect need[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch] 
And then we are like lions[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C/G[/ch] 
And we are bearing all our teeth[/tab]

[Interlude] 

[ch]C/G[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C/G[/ch] 

[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch] 
It is coming down the mountain[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]  
Fear that hoards you like a cold[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch] 
It wants to settle in your footprints[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C/G[/ch] 
Keep you still from where you're going[/tab]

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch] 
Aw, you think you know of losing[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch] 
Aw, you doubt of innocence[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch] 
That big sky still hangs above you[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C/G[/ch] 
Every day just wants to quit[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]C/G[/ch] 
There's no light you see to guide you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch] 
And it scares you just the same[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch] 
And then we are like lions[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C/G[/ch] 
Nothing dares get in our way[/tab]
 
[tab]         [ch]C/G[/ch] 
See your faithless sails drifting[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch] 
And your truth just cut apart[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch] 
And then we are like lions[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C/G[/ch] 
We are golden in our hearts[/tab]

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch] 
And then we are like lions[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
We are standing on two feet[/tab]
[tab][ch]C/G[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch] 
Hanging on the kitchen wall[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
For everyone to see[/tab]
[tab][ch]C/G[/ch]          
Get out your banjo[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch] 
So we can sing[/tab]

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch]             
There are winds that wrap and hold me[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch] 
There are whispers in the trees[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch] 
I cannot hold all that is sacred[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C/G[/ch] 
They are holding onto me[/tab]

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch] 
Kiss the years that all are dying[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch] 
Kiss the face that makes you stay[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch] 
They are in your rhythms walking[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C/G[/ch] 
They are showing you the way[/tab]

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch] 
Breath and breath above a sickness[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch] 
Shouting threats upon your life[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch] 
And then we are like lions[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C/G[/ch] 
We are fool enough to fight[/tab]
        
[tab][ch]C/G[/ch] 
It will cheat you in the balance[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch] 
Taking more than left to live[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch] 
And then we are like lions[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C/G[/ch] 
We are strong enough to give[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch] 
And then we are like lions[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C/G[/ch] 
We are strong enough to give[/tab]

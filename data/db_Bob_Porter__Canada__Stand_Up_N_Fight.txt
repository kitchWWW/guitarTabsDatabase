I grew up on the northern part of the island,[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
I learned to love her, and hate her as well.[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
Been on my mind now, for such a long time,[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]
Harbours and inlets all a-long the shoreline,[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]
Fishing boats tied up to community piers.[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
They're built by people who lived in those small towns,[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
Most of those families no longer live there.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
Well I'm proud of the people from old Newfoundland,[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
Many's a hardship, they all took their stand.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
We got Voisey Bay and a Churchill Falls plan,[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]
My Dad was a workin' man all of his life,[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]
A job that he hated, that's how he survived.[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]

[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
Half the man he is, I can hold my head high.[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]                                [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
And my Mom was a working woman, handing out mail,[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
From Monday to Sunday it never would fail.[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
Church Sunday morning or late in the night,[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
She'd hand out your letters with heartfelt delight.[/tab]

[Intro]
| [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] | [ch]G[/ch]   |

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Got a flat in Timbuktu, waiting for Triple-A[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]D[/ch]
When I saw that single headlight through the rain[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D7[/ch]
I flagged a kindly geezer down going the wrong way[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
We sped away and left rubber on all four lanes[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
He pulled a quick U-turn and hit a pickup from Montana[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]C[/ch]          
While ploughing down a fire hydrant too[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]G[/ch]
Windshield wipers slapping times, as he committed several traffic crimes[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
This guy's like a one-man wrecking crew[/tab]

[Chorus 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
Speeding's just a little bit of  what he put me through[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch]
And swerving, he went off the road and hit a tree, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch]
Driving can't be easy, Lord, when you're only 4 foot 2[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]         N.C.
You know, driving's not that difficult for you[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
But it's difficult to do if you're Mr. Magoo[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
When we drove right through a coal mine we hit a school bus full of nuns[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]E[/ch] 
We dragged along a string of traffic poles[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E7[/ch]
Through all kinds of weather, through eighteen hit-and-runs[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
His jalopy, Baby, kept us on the road[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
One day he lost his specs, oh Lord, he let 'em slip away[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]D[/ch]         
Still looking for them glasses I hope he finds them[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]A[/ch]
Well, I'd trade all of my tomorrows for some Dramamine today[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]                                
I just hope they know which body bag is mine[/tab]

[Chorus 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
Speeding's just a little word for   what he put me through[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch] 
His driving, you know, it scared the pee right out of me, yeah[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]A[/ch]
He's swerving and he's weaving, Lord, and he doesn't have a clue[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
You know driving's not that difficult for you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
But it's difficult to do if you're Mr. Magoo[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                            [ch]E[/ch]
Oh, lucky for us I know a little used shortcut[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                                       [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
Oh look out, look out, look out, look out, look out, look out, watch out now[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Oh, oh, oh, Mr. Magoo[/tab]

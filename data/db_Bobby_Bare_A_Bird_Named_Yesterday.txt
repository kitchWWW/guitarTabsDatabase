[Intro]
[ch]A[/ch]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
I had a bird he flew away[/tab]
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]               [ch]A7[/ch]
And I guess he's gone to stay[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
But I see him winging on his way[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E7[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A7[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
My flyaway bird named Yesterday[/tab]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
He's over the place of my birth[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A7[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
He's circling a spot that I know[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
He's hanging around the saw mill town[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]
Where the gentle summer breezes blow[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
I had a bird he flew away[/tab]
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]               [ch]A7[/ch]
And I guess he's gone to stay[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
But I see him winging on his way[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E7[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A7[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
My flyaway bird named Yesterday[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A7[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
He's riding on a train, he's down at the old swimming hole[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
He'll fly 'til he finds that old gang of mine[/tab]
[tab]                             N.C.     [ch]A[/ch]
Then he'll search for a tree    a big tall oak tree[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]A7[/ch]
Then he'll look from his perch at the old country church[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
I had a bird he flew away[/tab]
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]               [ch]A7[/ch]
And I guess he's gone to stay[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
But I see him winging on his way[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E7[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A7[/ch]
My flyaway bird named Yesterday[/tab]


[Outro]

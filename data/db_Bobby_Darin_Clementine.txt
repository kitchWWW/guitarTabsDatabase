           "CLEMENTINE" by Bobby Darin


intro:

[ch]C[/ch]-[ch]Am[/ch]-[ch]Dm[/ch]-[ch]G7[/ch]-|-[ch]C[/ch]-[ch]Am[/ch]-[ch]Dm[/ch]-[ch]G7[/ch]-|

verse 1:

in a cavern, down by a canyon , excavating, for a mine
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]Dm[/ch]          [ch]G7[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
there lived a miner, from north carolina, and his daughter, chubby Clementine[/tab]
                [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]G7[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]

verse 2:

every mornin', just about dawnin', when the sun, began to shine  
        [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Dm[/ch]                [ch]G7[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]

y'know she would rouse up, wake all of them cows up, and walk them down, to her daddies mine
                    [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]                        [ch]G7[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]

verse 3:

we took the footbridge, across the water, and though she weighed two-ninety-nine
             [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]                   [ch]G7[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]

that bridge trembled, and dissassembled, dropped her in, to the foamy brine
             [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]                [ch]G7[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]

verse 3:

cracked like thunder, you know she went under, blowing bubbles, down the line
             [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]Dm[/ch]             [ch]G7[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]

now i'm no swimmer, but where she thinner, i might've saved that Clementine
            [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Dm[/ch]                 [ch]G7[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]

verse 4:

she broke the record, way under water, we thought she, was doing fine
               [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]              [ch]G7[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]

i wasnt nervous, not until the service, that they held, for Clementine
            [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Dm[/ch]             [ch]G7[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]

verse 5:

so hey ya sailor! way out on ya whaler, with your harpoon, your trusty line
           [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Dm[/ch]                 [ch]G7[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]

if she shows now, yell "there she blows" now, it just may be, chunky Clementine!
          [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]G7[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]


 and thats all! yay! great classic song, have fun strumming along!

Heaven is a place where people die pretty[/tab]

Stars don't lie and there's cash in the kitty[/tab]

Running from the rocks, there's water for the lips[/tab]

To ease your mouth and bathe your fist[/tab]

There's no need for trouble when the road's all down[/tab]

Nobody's out of work cause the mimes in town[/tab]

In an Autumn field[/tab]

Tell my momma not to worry
The food is sweet and the weather's been sunny
and I'm well known roundabout
The local pick pocket is a layabout

Tell my daddy oh there's no need for washing
They do it in your sleep when you're not watching
I've already had the neighbors here
Johnny Cash came around and we split a beer


I'm dead and done by the heat of the sun
and I'll rest my hat in an Autumn field
and I'll hang my hat in an Autumn field
In an Autumn field

The girls up here sure look swell
They sing like birds, I hear it's nothing like hell
The local priest says there's no need for cheatin'
The local wags call it meetin' and a greetin'

I'm dead and I'm done by the heat of the sun
and I'll rest my hat in an Autumn field
and I'll hang my hat in an Autumn field.

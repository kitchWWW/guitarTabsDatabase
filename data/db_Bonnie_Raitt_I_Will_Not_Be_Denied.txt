[tab][ch]Cm7[/ch]
A true love story[/tab]
Is hard to find
Can't get no rest
Got no peace of mind
You say you gave
Your heart to me
You put me down
You set me free

[tab]               [ch]Fsus4[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]F7[/ch]
You said youre deadly[/tab]

[tab]                       [ch]Fsus4[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]F7[/ch]
Everybody said you was deadly[/tab]

I guess you know he is because

[tab][ch]Fsus4[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]F7[/ch]
Deadly[/tab]
Comes in every shape and size
Deadly
Always takes you by surprise
There you was
The only one
Coming on me and ruining my fun
Leave me setting
At home all alone
Waitin on your call by the telephone
You said youre deadly
Everybody said you was deadly
Guess you know you always was deadly
Comes in every shape and size
Deadly

[tab]                    [ch]G7[/ch]
Finally made me realize[/tab]
That i tried and tried
But you just cant get enough
So you lied and lied and lied

[tab]                  [ch]Fsus4[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]F7[/ch]
I will not be denied[/tab]

[tab]                     [ch]Fsus4[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]F7[/ch]
I'm gonna plant a seed[/tab]
I will not be denied
Of the man and the love i need


Said youre deadly
Everybody said you was deadly
Guess you know you are because
Deadly
Comes in every shape and size
Deadly
Always takes you by surprise
Its a sad situation
When yes its true
I can say it baby
I'm through with you
Its over now
And in the past
Gonna find me a man
With a love that'll last
You know he's deadly
Everybody said you was deadly
Guess you know you always been
Deadly
Comes in every shape and size
Deadly
Finally made me realize
That i tried and tried
But you just couldnt get enough
And so you
Lied and lied and lied
And i will not be denied
I will not be denied
I will not be denied

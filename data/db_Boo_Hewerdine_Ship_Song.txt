I Remember / Ship Song (Boo Hewerdine)
--------------------------------------

This is on Boo Hewerdine's second album, Ignorance. It's in Ab (capo at 1),
but the following is written as though it's in G at the nut.


The bit between ^^^^^^^ and   vvvvvvvvv   is "The Ship Song" written by Nick
Cave. The rest is written by Boo Hewerdine.


[Intro]:

[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  GD   x 2


[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I remember the yellow room[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
A face I've never seen since[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
A picture on the far wall[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
My hands on the bars[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And I remember asking about ugliness[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
and I remember the sky was broken[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
and I remember rain[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
on the other side of the road[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
and I remember the colour was wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
and I remember a dream about darkness[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                   [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
and I remember the sound of birds[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
and I remember careless talk   and I remember blood[/tab]
and I remember an imagined place,  running,  laughing

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
and I remember a white cat with no tail[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I remember the letter I gave to her husband[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                   [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
and I remember a terrible secret[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
and I remember jumping from the 14th step[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
and I remember pink ribbon in grey hair[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
and I remember 7:30  1969[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
and I remember standing in the hall[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
with strangers[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
and I remember leaving[/tab]


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Come  sail   your  ships around me  and burn your bridges down[/tab]
we make a little   history, baby,  every time you come   around
Let loose your dogs upon me         and let your hair hang down
You are a          mystery to me,  every time you come around.


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Your face has fallen saddened now,[/tab]
you  know  that  the time is  right
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
for   me  to   let   go your  wings **[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
and you, you must learn to fly[/tab]


repeat "come sail your ships . . ."
vvvvvvvvvvvvvv


[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I remember[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I remember[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I remember[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
leaving[/tab]


[tab][ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  GD
oooh   oooh   etc.[/tab]


end on [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]


All chords are standard (open) shapes.

I personally think that the third line of the bridge in the Ship Song (**,
above) sounds better played the same as the first two lines (i.e. Am, Em, C),
but that doesn't seem to be what's going on on the CD.


Any comments, corrections, etc. welcome.

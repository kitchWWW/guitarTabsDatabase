There's a southern train leaVin' here this mornin'[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
It's heading south at ten forty-five[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
I want to be on board that engine when it leaves here[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
And ride her back home to Caroline[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
I want to feel that southern sunshine on my shoulders[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
And visit with those friends I used to know[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                                           [ch]D[/ch]
I want to sit down on the front porch with my mother[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
And sing those gospel songs that she loves so[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                                                 [ch]D[/ch]
I want to walk those mountain trails and smell that laurel[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch]                                    [ch]A[/ch]
Take off my shoes and wade those mountain streams[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
And listen to the pine trees as they whisper[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Welcome home my son, its not a dream[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
This old cell'll be my home a long long time[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
But if I die now up here in this prison[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
Let me ride her back home one more time[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
And listen to the pine trees as they whisper[/tab]

Welcome home my son, its not a dream[/tab]

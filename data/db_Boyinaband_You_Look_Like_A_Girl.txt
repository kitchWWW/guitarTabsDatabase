[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Hey faggot[/tab]

Hey freak
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
Hey you girly worthless gay[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
Give me every minute back that I wasted looking at your face[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Your very presence irritates me, I can't listen to what you say because[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
Your lack of masculinity sickens me and I can't take it, ah![/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
You're a state, a disgrace, man and I ought to mention[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
That every hair on your head is a cry for attention[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Insist on that image then you deserve to be emasculated[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
So take a long hard look in the mirror and re-evaluate it[/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Finished? You really think you're more masculine?[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Nah man, you're insecure and full of it, take a laxative[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
I'm so sure of myself that I'm practically reaching nirvana[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
You're that guy that says "no homo" after he eats a banana[/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
I got that confidence that only comes with competence[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
But judging from your comments you've got some internal conflict[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Oh you gave your mate a hug? Yeah, better tap his back[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
'Cause you're scared that people think you want to tap his back[/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
I'm that guy that's calm, shows affection to friends[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
You're that guy that's guarded and he keeps his feelings in his head[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
I'm that guy that's strong enough to admit to his weakness[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
You're that guy that feels the need to stuff it when he's on the beaches[/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
And you see me as a threat to gender identity[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Acting like a guy with my style is an enemy[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
You can't tell the girls from the boys, it's a travesty![/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Oh no, now you might have to judge them on their personality[/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Something's wrong if some big long strands of hair can shake your worldview[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
I rock this look and people like it, at least my type of girls do[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
And I don't want a ripped body, I like mine[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
You call me stick thin then that's a fine line![/tab]

NC
Alright!
NC
Yeah
NC
Okay, okay, okay

[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
You wanna play it by your gender archetypes?[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
'Cause your logic is not entirely right[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
You hypocrite! I tried to be nice, but you're so ostensibly sexist[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
That I'm gonna have to prove on your terms who the best is![/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
So think: who has the more masculine confidence?[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
The man who anonymously calls a man that's androgynous[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
A fag 'cause it bothers him or the man with the gall to share[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
His character, thoughts and all of his talent with all of us?[/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
By your standards it's obvious that I am the embodiment here of[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Masculine dominance, but your standards are abhorrent[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
The fact is your cockiness here just masks your incompetence[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
And you cannot acknowledge it so you attack me ad hominem[/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Your gender normative values are crumbling[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Like a big-ass cake, mmm-mmm, my tummy's rumbling[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Yum yum, tastes like bigoted humbling[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
I'm almost as happy to tell you that you're morally wrong as Tumblr is[/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
So let me set this straight just like my sexual preference[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Oh wait, that simile just did it, um, what's next then?[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Well I guess that the next step now is to address that your best efforts doubtless will[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Never be as eloquent as anything I said and if you still don't get it lemme spell it out:[/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
No one benefits from being negative[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
About irrelevant things, that's the end of it[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
It's pointless; and if I didn't like someone's look[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
I'd accept it's their choice and just listen to what their message is[/tab]

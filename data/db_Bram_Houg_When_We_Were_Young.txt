[tab][ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]C/E[/ch]
 Everybody loves the things you do[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Dm[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
 From the way you talk to the way you move[/tab]

 Cause I've been by myself all night long[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Dm[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
 Hoping you're someone I used to know[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
 You look like a movie[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]
 You sound like a song[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
 My god this reminds me[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
 Of when we were young[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
 Let me photograph you in this light, in case it is the last time[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
 That we might be exactly like we were before we realized[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]C/E[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]Fm[/ch]
 We were sad of getting old, it made us restless[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Dm[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C/E[/ch]
 I was so scared to face my fears[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Dm[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
 Cause nobody told me that you'd be here[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]C/E[/ch]
 And I swore you moved overseas[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
 That's what you said when you left me[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                        [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
 You still look like a movie[/tab]

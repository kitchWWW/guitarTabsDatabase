 I put my trust in gold, I love the way it shines[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                                            [ch]A7[/ch]
 I'm getting comfortable dancing with all the lies[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Dm[/ch]
With all the lies[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
 My soul is not for sale, my heart is not for hire[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                                          [ch]A7[/ch]
 I've come too far to fail, gimme that holy fire[/tab]

That holy fire[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
I need more than all my eyes have seen[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
So I can live, I can love like it was meant to be[/tab]

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                                              [ch]A7[/ch]
 Please don't let me forgеt, you already set me free[/tab]

This world is not my home, oh, yeah[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]
There's a power that's deep inside of me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
So I can give, I can trust, let go of everything[/tab]

This world is not my home[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]A7[/ch]                                       [ch]Dm[/ch]
Don't fall in love with things that hands have made (Ooh-ooh-ooh)[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                     [ch]Dm[/ch]                      [ch]A7[/ch]
Out of the shadows and way past the shallow is where heaven waits[/tab]

I need more than all my eyes have seen (More than all my eyes have seen)[/tab]

There's a power that's deep inside of me (Ooh, deep down in my soul)[/tab]

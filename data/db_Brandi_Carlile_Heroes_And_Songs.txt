"Heroes And Songs"

[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
Some rights and some wrongs, some heroes and songs[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]
are much better left unsung[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
Between fiction and fact, illusion and pact[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
where we've been into what we've become[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
Although we have changed, we're never estranged[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
and there's nothing I'd trade from before[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]C#m[/ch]              [ch]F#m[/ch]
I love you my friend, my dear means to an end[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
but you're not in my dreams anymore[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
I'll never ally, although this is goodbye[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]
to the magical mystery tour[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
Keep the tears that I cried in my youth and my pride[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
and my sorrow like never before[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
I've got thankyous and smiles, and affection for miles[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]
and I always will look up to you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
You held open the door, for who I'm sent here for[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
to come in and make my dreams come true[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
Although it was sad, and it hurt 'cause it had to[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
there's nothing I'd change from before[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]C#m[/ch]              [ch]F#m[/ch]
I love you my friend, my dear means to an end[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
but you're not in my dreams anymore[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
Although it was sad and it hurt really bad[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
there's nothing I'd change from before[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]C#m[/ch]              [ch]F#m[/ch]
I love you my friend, my dear means to an end[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]F#m[/ch]
but you're not in my dreams anymore[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
You're not in my dreams anymore[/tab]

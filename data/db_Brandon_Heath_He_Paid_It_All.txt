[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
   He wants my heart, more than he asks for my wage[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
   One day I'll die, but it won't be my last day[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
  A song full of praise, from a mouth full of doubt[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
  I lift up my face, and I sing out loud[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
  With all my mistakes, I still make him proud[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]C(7)[/ch]
  Carried that cross for you[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]
  On that rugged walk, He knew[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
  What he had to do[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
  Opened his arms up wide[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
  Invited the world inside[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]
  One final breathe[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]
  He conquered death[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
  Just across town, or a place where I don't know a soul[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]

[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Do you have a favorite song? Do you have a greatest fear?[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Do you have an angel and a devil, who whisper in your ear?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
What's your worst day ever?While your at it, what's your best?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Do you think it's one big accident? Maybe one big test?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Do you say your mama's prayer? Or you hold your daddy's grudge?[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
Are you a little more revenge or do you lean in more to love ?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Do you have that one regret or do you have a few?[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
Yeah, me too[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Bm[/ch]
You've got a heart like mine and it's shaped like mine[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
It's hard like mine, so it breaks like mine[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Bm[/ch]
It's strong like mine, gets it wrong like mine[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
So, forgive that I forget sometimes[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
Yours it's just like mine[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
Your heart is just like mine[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Here we go again, at each other's throats[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
Hell bent on where we are scared of what the future holds[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You say that it is, I say that it ain't[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
We get hung up on the different but one thing remains the same[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Bm[/ch]

[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
It's hard like mine, so it breaks like mine[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]G/F#[/ch]
It's strong like mine, gets it wrong like mine[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
So, forgive that I forget sometimes[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Yours it's just like mine[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
Your heart is just like mine[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Show me your white flag[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
And then let me show you mine[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
We'll see what's underneath our pockets[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
And beating right in time[/tab]

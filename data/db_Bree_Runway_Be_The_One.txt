[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
 No, I can't slip away in the night[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Maybe someday, you'd meet me in the deep end[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
 Hear the voices in my head decide[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
And you know, I just needed a reason[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]Bm[/ch]
Should I lay down and die, without you by my side -can you hear me cry?[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
All the things you've said? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
 Then you tell me that I can't get away from the pain, when it's starin' in my face[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
I can see the tears in your eyes when you look in mine[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
Told you for the thousandth time, you should be the one for me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Should I stay here tonight? Baby, you decide[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Hopin' you'd be the one,  you could be the one[/tab]


[Post-Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]Bm[/ch]
You could be  be the one  you could be (You could be the one)[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
Be the one  you could be[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
 You don't seem so far when you're away from me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
What you've done for me, all the memories (All that you've done)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
When we're far apart and you're not here with me[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
Need your company like the air I breathe (All that you've done)[/tab]

Should I lay down and die, without you by my side -can you hear me cry?[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
All the things you've said? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)[/tab]

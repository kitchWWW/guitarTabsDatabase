[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
I never told you about those days[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
I took the car and I ran away[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
And I was shaken, I was insecure[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
And I had never wanted something more[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
There's a man on my back and he's there all the time[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
And he's gone when I need him most[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
And I'm coming up short, but I know I'll be fine[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
I just hate to get so close[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Momma if you needed something[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
I'll be hangin' round, not hard to find, oh[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And now you got just what you wanted[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Try and find a way to spend your time, oh, oh, oh[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
And I'm coming up short, but I know I'll be fine[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause at least I got a view[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
And I know I'm gonna be alright[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Once I get right next to you, oh[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
My feet they move, my feet they move fast[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I was not sure if I wanted this to last, no[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause I would rise up all above those waves, no[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
With an arrow, point to me your way, mom[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
There's a man on my back and he's there all the time[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
And he's gone when I need him most[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
And I'm coming up short, but I know I'll be fine[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
I just hate to get so close[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Momma if you needed something[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
I'll be hangin' round, not hard to find, oh[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And now you got just what you wanted[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Try and find a way to spend your time, oh, oh, oh[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]Gm[/ch]
And I'm sorry I did not say I loved you, before I didn't[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]Gm[/ch]
And I'm sorry I did not say I loved you, before I didn't[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
Out in the day where you walk in the rain[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
And the driving cold wind hits you dead in the face[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
And the eye of the storm brings you peace, but just for a while[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
And then back in the race can you keep up the pace[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Out of the black well a memory comes back[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#[/ch]                                        [ch]E[/ch]
But you want to forget too many regrets from your past[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]        [ch]G#m[/ch]
Well, everyone talks about changing the world[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]
But nobody talks about changing themselves[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                                                  [ch]E[/ch]
I feel the coming, the rising of something that's good[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G#m[/ch]
Now the innocent gone disappeared in the flame[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]                                    [ch]F#[/ch]
It's repeating itself again and again and nothing will stop me[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]E[/ch]
'Cause I will find beauty in this[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]G#m[/ch]
I'll leave it all behind, the future's still untold[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C#m[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]F#[/ch]
Don't let it pass me by, 'cause only love can judge me now[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]G#m[/ch]
This blood runs through my veins, mixed up and left for dead[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C#m[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]F#[/ch]               [ch]G#m[/ch]
Don't let it pass me by, 'cause only love, only love can judge me now[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]        [ch]G#m[/ch]
In the garden of Eden there's blood on the ground[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Hiding like stealth, never making a sound[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                                                [ch]E[/ch]
You wait for a moment, a moment that just never comes[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G#m[/ch]
And you say you're reliable as you read from the bible[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]
But I got to leave, this means nothing to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                                 [ch]E[/ch]
I want to see a faith in humanity born[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]G#m[/ch]
I'll leave it all behind, the future's still untold[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C#m[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]F#[/ch]
Don't let it pass me by, 'cause only love can judge me now[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]G#m[/ch]
This blood runs through my veins, mixed up and left for dead[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C#m[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]F#[/ch]               [ch]C#m[/ch]
Don't let it pass me by, 'cause only love, only love can judge me now[/tab]

And when the silence gets too loud, there's an aching in your soul[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]B[/ch]
I pray for you with all my might, you are my best friend[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]G#m[/ch]
You say you're at peace right now and there could be no other[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]G#m[/ch]
You are just like a brother, you are just like a brother to me[/tab]

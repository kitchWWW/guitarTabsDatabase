Intro
[ch]E[/ch] [ch]F#[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] x2

[ch]E[/ch]

[tab][ch]E[/ch] [ch]F#[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
I was born in a high fashioned window breaking blood and drinking bones[/tab]
Where a tear stained reflection and bad confrontations climb through in stereo

[tab][ch]F#[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]
Being born into darkness gets cold before it gets warm[/tab]

And I thought that my life was like comic books, or black flag 45s
If it goes out of print you forget about finding it on the other side

You were lucky to get what was scraped off the bottom rung

[tab][ch]F#[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]
And everything you say is something that I should say back to you[/tab]
And your slick forked tongue is the first one that I’ll put a barrel to, yeah
It’s like Barry said self preservation, submission bein fed doesn’t make you free
And like adam and steve I will not let these snakes get the best of me

I was top hats and whip-snaps and arctic sun from 5 to 17
With your two-liter bottles of bartles and james why, I’m sure we made the team

And I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I just don’t believe in coincidence

I know you were there ‘cause we planned it on the seventh Sabbath day
You gave your heart back to jesus got sober goin home, and got, killed along the way

You were shaking like ice in a glass that had yet to be poured
There is nothing like dyin’ to know what it’s like to be bored

[tab][ch]F#[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]
And everything you say is something that I should say back to you[/tab]
And your slick forked tongue is the first one that I’ll put a barrel to, yeah
It’s like Barry said self preservation, submission doesn’t make you free
And like adam and steve I will not let these snakes get the best of me

[ch]E[/ch] [ch]F#[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] x2

[ch]E[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]

[tab][ch]G#[/ch] [ch]F#[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]
If they cut the power and guided by voices, I’m singing to myself like I ever had the [/tab]
choice and were staying right here cause nothing gets better than this x4

[tab][ch]F#[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]
And everything you say is something that I should say back to you[/tab]
And your slick forked tongue is the first one that I’ll put a barrel to, yeah
It’s like Barry said self preservation, submission doesn’t make you free
And like adam and steve I will not let these snakes get the best of me

I will not let these snakes get the best of me x 3

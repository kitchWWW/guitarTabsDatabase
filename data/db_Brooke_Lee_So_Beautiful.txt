[Intro]
[ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
The way you grab my hips and call me "little lady"[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                   [ch]Em[/ch]
Smoking cigarettes, talking shit in the back of the bar[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
In the dark, way I danced drove you crazy[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Drove you crazy[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
The way that we laughed out the crowd, getting wasted[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                                        [ch]Em[/ch]
You said "let's escape, I know a place out the back, not too far"[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]D[/ch]
Took my heart to your car and we drove like crazy[/tab]
         N.C.
Drove me crazy


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]
I held another hand for the first time in a long time[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Let somebody close, for a moment I was floating[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Looked into some eyes that werе bluer than the ocean[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]Em[/ch]
Hеard somebody new say that I was beautiful[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
So beautiful[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Tangled on the floor, ten o'clock in the morning[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Didn't close our eyes all night, we were pouring[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                           [ch]D[/ch]
Out our secrets, said you wanna show me your world[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Oh-oh[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]
I held another hand for the first time in a long time[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Let somebody close, for a moment I was floating[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Looked into some eyes that werе bluer than the ocean[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]Em[/ch]
Hеard somebody new say that I was beautiful[/tab]

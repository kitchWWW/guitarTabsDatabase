[[ch]F[/ch]]  [[ch]A7[/ch]]  [[ch]D[/ch]]
 
[D] I breeze through the [Bm] day, and [Em] nothing much seems, to [A7] get  
in my way
 
[D] I don't have a [Bm] care, at [Em] all [A7]
 
[G] You walk in the [A7] room.  It's [D] always the [Bm] same, you  [D6] call 
out my name
 
I [G] turn.  You [A7] smile, and I [D] fall [A7] 
 
 
[D] I'm at home at [Bm] night, just [Em] bein' alone, and [A7] doin'  alright
 
[D] When out of the [Bm] blue, you [Em] call [A7]
 
[G] I hang up the [A7] phone.  I [D] lay down in [Bm] bed, you're [D6]  still 
in my head
 
I [G] dream.  You [A7] smile, and I [D] fall [D7]
 
 
Bridge:
[F] Oh what could this [A7] feeling [D] be?
 
[F] Could it really be [Em] love, and it's [G] happening to [A7] me?
 
 
[D] The closer you [Bm] get, the [Em] harder it is, to [A7] keep it  together
 
[D] I don't have a [Bm] chance, at [Em] all [A7] 
 
[G] It's out of my [A7] hands.  Oh, but [D] what can I [Bm] do?   I'm [D6] 
crazy for you
 
We [G] touch.  You [A7] smile, and I [D] fall [Bm] 
 
We [[ch]G[/ch]] touch.  You [[ch]A7[/ch]] smile, and I [[ch]D[/ch]] fall  [[ch]Bm[/ch]]   [[ch]Em[/ch]]  [[ch]F[/ch]]  [[ch]A7[/ch]]  [[ch]D[/ch]]

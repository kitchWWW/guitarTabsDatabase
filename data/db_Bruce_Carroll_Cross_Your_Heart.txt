[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                          [ch]G7[/ch]
At the start of the day  do you kneel and pray?[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Do you go  your own way  all  a-lone?[/tab]

Don't you know there's a plan,  and it's all in the hands,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D7[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
of the One   at the right  of the throne.[/tab]

Does Je-sus ev-er cross your  heart? Are you walk-in by your-self[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D7[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
in the dark?  Has your soul been saved, res-cued from the grave?[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D7[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]

Do you give any thought to what His pre-cious blood has bought[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Do you wonder  why He  had to die?[/tab]
[tab]                                                 [ch]Em[/ch]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D7[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
He paid the debt for you   and    I.[/tab]

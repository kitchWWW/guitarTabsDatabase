When it's love you give[/tab]
                    (I'll be a man of good faith.)

Verse 2:(same as verse 1)

When there's love inside
                      (I swear I'll always be strong.)
then there's a reason why.
                       (I'll prove to you we belong.)
I'll be the wal that protects you
from the wind and the rain,
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]Asus4[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
from the hurt and pain.[/tab]


Chorus:
[ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Em7[/ch]  [ch]D/F#[/ch]   (N.[ch]C[/ch].)

[tab]                              [ch]D/F#[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
Let's make it all for one and all for love.[/tab]
[ch]Em7[/ch]                                  [ch]D/A[/ch]              
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
 Let the one you hold be the one you want, the one you[/tab]
need,
[tab]         [ch]D/F#[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Bm[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D/F#[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
'cause when it's all for one it's one for all.[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Em7[/ch]          [ch]D/F#[/ch]
When there's someone that you know[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D/A[/ch] 
then just let your feelings show[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D/F#[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
and make it all for  one and all for love.[/tab]


Verse 3:(same as Verse 1)

When it's love you make
                    (I'll be the fire in your night.)
then it's love you take.
                     (I will defend, I will fight.)
I'll be there when you need me.
When honor's at stake,
this vow I will make.


Chorus:(same as before)
That it's all for one and all for love.
Let the one be the one you want,
the one you need,
'cause when it's all for one it's one for all.
When there's someone that should know
then just let your feelings show
and make it all for one and all for love.

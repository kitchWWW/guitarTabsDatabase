Intro:

[ch]F#m7[/ch]


Verse 1:

[tab][ch]F#m7[/ch]*
Deep down in Mississippi[/tab]
I found my sweet delta blues.
She weaved a little southern spell on me,
Made a little voodoo.
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]
She was born the bright side of midnight[/tab]
When her mama was seventeen.
[tab]          [ch]F#m7[/ch]
She was a hot blooded, God fearin' gospel girl,[/tab]
The finest that I'd ever seen.
Oh.


Pre-chorus:

[tab][ch]C#[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
She's black coffee. Little bit o' cream;[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
Sweet brown sugar, my midnight dream.[/tab]

[ch]F#5[/ch] - [ch]F#5[/ch] - [ch]A5[/ch] - [ch]G#5[/ch] - [ch]F#5[/ch]


Chorus:

[tab]        [ch]F#7[/ch]*
Black Pearl,[/tab]
Yeah, my kinda girl.
Just the kind of thing to rock my world.
Black Pearl,
She's my kinda girl.


Verse 2 (same as verse 1):

Met her in a dixie diner,
Put on the southern hospitality.
I can still smell her sweet molasses
Running all over me.
We started rollin' like a river,
Like a twister tearin' through the town.
We we're tongue-tied, satisfied, southern fried.
As she drove this ol' dixie down.


Pre-chorus and chorus: (same as before)


Bridge:

[tab][ch]B[/ch]
  Yeah, she's alright. Yeah, she's okay.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
   Well, makin' love all night.[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, really made my day.[/tab]


Solo: same as verse


Ending:

[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]
She was born the bright side of midnight[/tab]
When her mama was seventeen.
[tab]          [ch]F#m7[/ch]
She was a hot blooded, God fearin' gospel girl,[/tab]
The finest that I'd ever seen.

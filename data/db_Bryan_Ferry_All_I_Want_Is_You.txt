[tab]     [ch]A#[/ch]
        Somebody told me[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G#[/ch]
        Just the other day[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D#[/ch]
        That you're leaving me[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
        We're through[/tab]

        Well if you knew
        How it hurt me so
        Then you'd changed your mind
        I'm sure
        Don't want to hear
        What's going on
        I don't care
        What's new
[tab]     [ch]A#[/ch]
        Don't want to know[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G#[/ch]
        About anything[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D#[/ch]    [ch]A#[/ch]
        'Cos all I want[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D#[/ch]
        Is you[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]Cm[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
        Going out with other girls[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cm[/ch]                [ch]A#[/ch]
        Was always such a bore[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cm[/ch]                  [ch]G#[/ch]
        But since I fell in love with you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D#[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
        I need you more and more[/tab]

        Don't want to know
        About one-night-stands
        Cut-price souvenirs
        All I want is
        The real thing
        And a night that lasts
        For years.

        If you ever change your mind
        I've a certain cure
        An old refrain, it lingers on
        L'amour, toujours l'amour...

        Don't want to learn
        About etiquette
        From glossy magazines
        Why should I try
        To talk correct
        Like they do
        In other scenes
        Say no more about imagery
        You're starting to confuse
        Just make an offer
        Of more romance
        Of course I can't refuse
        All I want is you
        Oo oo I'm all cracked up on you.

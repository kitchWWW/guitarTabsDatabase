'Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Gace my fear relieved
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed

We're been there ten thousand years
Bright, shiny as the sun
We're no less days to sing God's praise
Then when we first begun

Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see ...

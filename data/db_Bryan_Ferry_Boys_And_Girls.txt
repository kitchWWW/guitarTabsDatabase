Intro: 

[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm a stranger in your town[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]
That's the place I belong[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
Laid behind the frame[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Bm[/ch]
And the curtain's torn again[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]
A wailing saxophone[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Bm[/ch]
You know it's all in my song[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
All the sin that I can take[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Bm[/ch]    ([ch]Bm7[/ch])
But you don't even know my name[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]             ([ch]Bm7[/ch])
              (boys and girls)[/tab]
              (boys and girls)
              (boys and girls)

You've got no sense of fun
But you know I've one
All the good has turned to bad
And you know what I think of that
No time to dream, no time to sigh
No time to kill, when love walks by
And who's that crying in the street?
Death is a friend I've yet to meet

Intro: [ch]Am[/ch]

[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
Well I rush out blazin' my pulse is racin'[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]
As the rain streams down my face[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
There's no turning back now to fight with fate[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
Outnumbered 'n out of place[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]
They said go west young man, that's best[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
It's there you'll feel no pain[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Bel-Air's okay if you dig the grave[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
But I want to live again[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]
Can't let go[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
There's a madness in my soul tonight[/tab]
Can't let go
Must ride like the storm
Can't let go
Will I run out of control tonight
Can't let go
Until every trace is gone

It's a winding road from Cuesta way
Down sunset to the beach
Though Canoga Park is a straight safe drive
It's too far outta reach
But now the headlights are flashin' by so fast
All directions seems the same
And the windscreen wipers keep a beat repeatin'
You can't let go again

[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
What's in a name on the street tonight[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
I'm only a face in the crowd[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
All in the dark and afraid tonight[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Bb[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
Nowhere to run or to hide[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bb[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Bb[/ch]           as chorus ([ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch] ...)
But I can't let go         no no no no[/tab]

[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                                     [ch]Dm[/ch]   
Sometimes the world outside'll take you in with just a smile[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
And you so blinded with desire[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
A hundred sleepless nights have left me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Dm[/ch]
Wasted and so cold[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]
But I can take it I'm hangin' on[/tab]

Can't let go
There's a madness in my soul tonight
Can't let go
Must ride it like the storm
Can't let go
Will I run out of control tonight
Can't let go
Until every trace is gone

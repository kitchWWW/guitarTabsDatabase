My sun is set - and my day is done [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#[/ch]
When I turn to the east I can see no dawn [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G#[/ch](7)
But iron horse come - buffalo gone [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D#m[/ch]
Like blades of grass they cut us all down [/tab]
Yes I know what it is to be free 
To run as far as the eye can see 
But long knife come - buffalo gone 
Like blades of grass they cut us all down

     Why in the world are you so cruel?    |x2[/tab]

Here is a girl who's working in a factory 
Spends all her time there thinking what she want to be 
She got no boyfriend - she got no window 
She just a lonely heart - it's tearing me apart 
There's a boy now doesn't have a word to say 
Cat got your tongue now - night to night and day to day 
He got no girl friend - he got no money 
He just a lonely heart - it's tearing me apart 

     Why in the world are you so cruel? 

Intro

Everywhere I go there's a world full of heartbreak 
Hole in the sky now - tell me where for God's sake 
Where is that sunshine? where is that rainbow? 
Who got an answer here? tell me what I want to know 
Nobody knows the trouble I see 
Nobody cares - nobody but me 
And James Bond, Jackie O, Johnnie Ray and Garbo 
Who got an answer here? tell me what I want to know 

     Why in the world are you so cruel?

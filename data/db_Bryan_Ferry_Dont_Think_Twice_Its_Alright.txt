Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]B[/ch]

Don't think twice, it's all right[/tab]

And it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe 
That light I never knowed 
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe 
I'm on the dark side of the road 
But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say 
To try and make me change my mind and stay 
We never did too much talkin' anyway 
Don't think twice, it's all right

So it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal 
Like you never done before 
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal 
I can't hear you any more 
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' down the road 
I once loved a woman, a child I am told 
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul 
Don't think twice, it's all right

So long honey babe 
Where I'm bound, I can't tell 
Goodbye's too good a word, babe 
So I'll just say fare thee well 
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind 
You could have done better but I don't mind 
You just kinda wasted my precious time 
Don't think twice, it's all right

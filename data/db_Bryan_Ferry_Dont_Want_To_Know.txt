           Don't Want To Know[/tab]

I want to play on night to night the world on a string
You look at me and I wonder what goes on
All that money could buy all of those things
I could never be sure where to begin
    
           Don't Want To Know
           Don't Want To Know
           Don't Want To Know
           Don't Want To Know

Friday night in the rain somebody new
Better now babe never take it from me
I got nothing but no so many times
Hold it out to me now broken in two 

           Don't Want To Know
           Don't Want To Know
           Don't Want To Know
           Don't Want To Know ...

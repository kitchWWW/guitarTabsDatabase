[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]              [ch]D#[/ch]
  In days gone by [/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
  There was a king [/tab]
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]         
  A fool for love [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Gm[/ch]
  And all it brings [/tab]

  So high and wise 
  Could read your mind 
  A fool for love 
  And love is blind 

  A crowded street 
  An empty train 
  A fool for love 
  You cry in vain 

[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
  A fool for love[/tab]
  A fool for love
  A fool for love

  In days gone by 
  There was a queen 
  A fool for love 
  And all it means 

  Red ruby lips 
  Don't touch me eyes 
  A fool for love 
  And love is blind 

  A fool for love
  A fool for love
  A fool for love

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                     [ch]D#[/ch]
  Like flowers in the rain[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Gm[/ch] 
  I'm twisted up inside [/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
  I'll never be the same [/tab]
  I hear the same old lines 
  You played me for a fool 
  You really hurt my pride 

Verse

  A fool for love
  A fool for love
  A fool for love

  In days gone by 
  There was a king 
  A fool for love 
  And all it brings 

  So high and wise 
  Could read your mind 
  A fool for love 
  And love is blind

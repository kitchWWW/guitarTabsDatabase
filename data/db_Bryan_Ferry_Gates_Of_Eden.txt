Intro: [ch]E[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
Of war and peace the truth just twists[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]
Its curfew gull just glides[/tab]
Upon four-legged forest clouds
The cowboy angel rides
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]G#m[/ch]
With his candle lit into the sun[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F#m[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]B[/ch]
Though its glow is waxed in black[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]Em7[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden[/tab]

The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
But still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the Gates of Eden

With a time-rusted compass blade
Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Side saddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise
You will not hear a laugh
All except inside the Gates of Eden

as version

Relationships of ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly
And wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden

The motorcycle black madonna
Two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden

At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words
But these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

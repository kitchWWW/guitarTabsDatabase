or heard your lying tongue [/tab]

I'll see you in my dreams [/tab]

Sometimes I live in the country 
Sometimes I live in the town 
Sometimes I have a great notion 
to jump into the river and drown
 
Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight 
Goodnight Irene, Goodnight Irene 
I'll see you in my dreams 

Stop ramblin', stop your gamblin' 
stop stayin' out late at night 
Go home to your wife and your family 
sit down by the fireside bright 

Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight 
Goodnight Irene, Goodnight Irene 
I'll see you in my dreams 

I love Irene God knows I do 
love her till the sea run dry 
And if Irene turns her back on me 
I'm gonna take morphine and die 

Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight 
Goodnight Irene, Goodnight Irene 
I'll see you in my dreams

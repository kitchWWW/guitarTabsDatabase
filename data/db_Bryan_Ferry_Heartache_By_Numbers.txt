[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]
I can't stop from thinking[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
That love makes no sense[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]
I'm burned out from dreamin'[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Like nobody else[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]B[/ch]
  Midnight to daybreak[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G#m[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
  I can't believe the pain[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]B[/ch]
  The way you look[/tab]
  The way you talk
[tab]       [ch]G#m[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
  The way you walk away[/tab]

        From violet to grey[/tab]

        I paint all your colours[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]
        I wash them away[/tab]
        I live for the moment
        I long for the day
        You walk in my garden
        You lie in my shade

Every night I run around
With every girl in town
I would rather stay at home
If you were still around

  Midnight to daybreak
  I'd do it all again
  The way you look
  The way you talk
  I'd be your lover, not your friend
  (Oh, I can't stay)

Chorus

Guitar & Keys Solos     as intro

   Midnight to daybreak
   I'd do it all again
   The way you look
   The way you talk
   I'd be your lover, not your friend
   (Oh, I can't stay)

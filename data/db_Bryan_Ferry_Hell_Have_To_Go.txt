And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go[/tab]

Whisper to me tell me do you love me true
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make your mind
I've got to know
Should I hang up or will tou tell him he'll have to go

If you want me answer "Yes" or "No" darling I will understand[/tab]

Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Let's pretend that we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the juke-box way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go

Intro: [ch]F[/ch]
 
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Hark the frozen chimes of winter[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bb[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
Crystal shimmer in your mind[/tab]
To the first time when you saw her
You implored her to be kind
In the open fields around you
All before you gone to ground
Both the question and the answer
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]    DmCDm
Deep inside you, you shall find[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
    And while you're strollin'[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
    Through the summer of your years[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
    Enchanted, a garden overgrown[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
    Don't call me sentimental[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
    Those of you who care[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch] 
    Could find there a lover and a friend, to the end[/tab]

Solo as version

    And if you're taken
    By the sprit of your age
    No reason to carve a cornerstone
    Sway me, trade me
    Your philosophy
    First you're sowin'
    Then you're growin'
    Then you reap, until you sleep

Will you scale the silver studded mountain
Where contemplation will spring to mind?
See the veiled prophet's withered gaze
Reflect the "nouvelle vague"
Glazed visions imprisoned in your mind

Unwinding rivers flowing through the meadows
To the sea, paths of glory
Through shifting glades to fall

Present laughter and the memory
Of troubles you have seen
It is written in your mind

[ch]F[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]  to fade

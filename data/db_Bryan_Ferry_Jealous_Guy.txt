I was dreaming of the past[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Em7[/ch]
And my heart was beating fast[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]
I began to lose control[/tab]

   I didn't mean to hurt you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]Bb[/ch]
I'm sorry that I made you cry[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]

I'm just a jealous guy[/tab]

I was feeling insecure
You might not love me any more
I was shivering inside
I was shivering inside

I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy

I was trying to catch your eyes
Thought that you were trying to hide
I was swallowing my pain
I was swallowing my pain

I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy

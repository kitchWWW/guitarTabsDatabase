They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess out of you[/tab]
 
If you see Saint Annie, please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move my fingers, they are all in a knot
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
And my best, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got
 
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English, and she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice, and leaves you howling at the moon
 
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough
But the joke was one me, there was nobody there to even bluff
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough

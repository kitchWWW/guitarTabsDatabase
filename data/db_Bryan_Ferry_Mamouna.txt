[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
So you say[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]C#[/ch]
You're living just for fun[/tab]
[tab]([ch]C#[/ch])       [ch]G#m[/ch]
Isn't it enough?[/tab]

So you say
You wait o will it come
Isn't it enough?

You a prisoner of loving
You're chained and bound

I could never be the one
In the moonlight and the sun

[tab][ch]C#[/ch]                [ch]G#m[/ch]
O Mamouna Mamouna run      |x4[/tab]

You and me
We're just like night and day
The here and now
The ghost of yesterday

Hack and tear
We're prisoners of loving
We're chained and bound

There's a road I've got to take
A thread you got to break 

[tab][ch]C#[/ch]                [ch]G#m[/ch]
O Mamouna Mamouna run ... to fade [/tab]

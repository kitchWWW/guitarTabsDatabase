Intro: [ch]D#m[/ch]  [ch]C#[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]  [ch]G#m[/ch]  [ch]D#m[/ch]  [ch]C#[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]  [ch]G#m[/ch]

[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]           [ch]C#[/ch]  
Me oh my - I can't believe my eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                           [ch]G#m[/ch]
Everything I care about is gone - I wonder why[/tab]

Life is tough - no matter how I try
Tell me that I'm dreaming
Tell me it's a lie

Me oh my - show me that you're mine
Can't you hear my beating heart
Go in and out of time

[ch]D#m[/ch]  [ch]C#[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]  [ch]G#m[/ch]

Me oh my - I can't go on
What can I believe in
Now that you're gone

Ring phone ring - a telephone line
Can't you hear my beating heart
Go in and out of time

[ch]D#m[/ch]  [ch]C#[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]  [ch]G#m[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]D#m[/ch]        [ch]C#[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
    Out of my mind, out of the blue[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G#m[/ch]              [ch]D#m[/ch]
    Something incredible, so deja vu[/tab]

    How many times, broken in two
    Maybe the same thing'll happen to you

as intro

Me oh my - my world gone wrong
Running out, running out,
Of everything I want

    Out of my mind, out of the blue
    Something incredible, so deja vu

    How many times, broken in two
    Maybe the same thing'll happen to you

    Nothing is real, nothing is true
    Wish I could say the same thing about you
    
    How many times, broken in two
    Wish I could stay, but I'm just passing through

       Nobody loves me[/tab]
       Nobody loves me

When the cold wind blows I think of you 
Your emerald eyes your golden shoes 
You walk away from my rage 
On the flaggy shore I watch the waves

       Nobody loves me
       Nobody loves me
Intro

Vermilion sky I don't think so 
A cigarette and voices low 
What should I do - what could I say 
What's goin on, let's drift away 
       
       Nobody loves me
       Nobody loves me

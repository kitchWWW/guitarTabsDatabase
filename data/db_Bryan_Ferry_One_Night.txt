One night with you[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G#[/ch]
Is what I'm now praying for[/tab]
The things that we two could plan
[tab]                            [ch]C#[/ch]
Would make my dreams come true[/tab]

Just call my name
And I'll be right by your side
I want your sweet helping hand
My loves too strong to hide

One night with you

The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true

as verse

    Always lived, very quiet life
    I ain't never did no wrong
    Now I know that life without you
    Has been too lonely too long

One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true

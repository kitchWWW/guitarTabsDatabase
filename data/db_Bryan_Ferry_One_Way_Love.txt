[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                       [ch]Bb[/ch]
I thought I could find the kind of girl[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]
Who'd think that I was the only guy in the world[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]Ab[/ch]
No more half-hearted kisses, oh that's bad enough[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]Ab[/ch]   [ch]Bb[/ch]  [ch]Eb[/ch]
Oh-oh-oh, no more teardrops, no one-way love[/tab]

Don't look for someone who likes to love fast
You know that that kind of love will never last
If she's fast and furious, oh that can be tough

Oh-oh-oh, no more teardrops, no one-way love

[tab]                 [ch]Ab[/ch]                           [ch]Eb[/ch]   
Well, there are girls who like to cheat and flirt[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]Eb[/ch]
Those kind of girls are worst of all[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Ab[/ch]                     [ch]Bb[/ch]          [ch]Ab[/ch]       [ch]Eb[/ch]
How they lie, you know how they hurt [/tab]

Take it from me I know what I say
I'll find me a girl who don't like to play
The game of heartbreak, well that's mighty rough
Oh-oh-oh, no more teardrops no one-way love
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]   [ch]Bb[/ch]  [ch]Eb[/ch]            [ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]Eb[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]     
One-way love             One way love...[/tab]

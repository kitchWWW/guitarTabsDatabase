[tab][ch]F[/ch]
When the world outside of you[/tab]
Seems to weigh too much for you
[tab]       [ch]Bb[/ch]
Then draw within yourself[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
For there is no one else[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
It's a sin[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bb[/ch]
What I'm sayin'[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
But it's truth[/tab]

Black and blue has turned to grey
Real life pictures gone astray
But don't give in
Imagination rules again
It's a sin
What I'm sayin'
But it's the truth

[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
    Party doll[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
    Oh how you turn me on[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
    Now the day's for sleepin'[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
    For I'll be leapin' all night long[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
    Party doll[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
    Without you I can't go on[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]B[/ch]
    Now the way I'm figurin'[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
    You'll be Leda[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
    And I'll be Swann[/tab]

as versoin

  It's a sin
  What I'm sayin'
  But it's truth

  It's a sin
  What I'm sayin'
  But it's truth

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                    
  And if our secret love[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]       
  Is haunting you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
  No one can hold me[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch] 
  Like you used to do[/tab]

solo as intro

Party doll, what's your game?
Do you move, or entertain
What people say
When it don't mean a thing?
It's a sin
Heads they lose
Tails you win

Party doll, I must confess
This wishin' well of loneliness
Has dragged you down
I'll wind you up, let's twist again
It's a sin
Skin to skin
Amen

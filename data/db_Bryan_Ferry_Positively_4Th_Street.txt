[tab][ch]D#[/ch]            [ch]Fm[/ch]
You've got a lotta nerve [/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                  [ch]D#[/ch]
To say you are my friend [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D#[/ch]     [ch]Bb[/ch]  
When I was down [/tab]
[tab] [ch]G#[/ch]        [ch]Cm[/ch]          [ch]Bb[/ch]
You just stood there grinning [/tab]

You got a lotta nerve 
To say you got a hand to lend 
You just want to be on 
The side that's winning 

You say I let you down 
You know it's not like that 
If you're so hurt 
Why then don't you show it 

You say you lost your faith 
But that's not where it's at 
You had no faith to lose 
And you know it 

I know the reason 
That you talk behind my back 
I used to be among the crowd 
You're in with 

Do you take me for such a fool 
To think I'd make contact 
The one who tries to hide 
What he don't know to begin with 

I wish that for just one time 
You could stand inside my shoes 
And just for that one moment 
I could be you 

Yes, I wish that for just one time 
You could stand inside my shoes 
You'd know what a drag it is 
To see you

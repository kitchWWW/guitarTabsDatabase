Walk up the driveway[/tab]
Endlessly curving
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]
Go through the front door[/tab]
It's so inviting
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
Baronial Great Hall[/tab]
Once so exciting
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Haunted by shadows[/tab]
Faces in hiding.

Chair by the fire
I feel a tremor
Silent reminder
You used to be there
You are the princess
My wanders wake you
Fantasy playmate
Candle light lover

      San Simeon[/tab]

Teasing in French
Lace exotic promise 
So undemanding 
Yet understanding 
Each wall a picture
Some of his best work 
Delicate touches
They're simply charming 
Coffee table culture
Full colour pages 
Props archetypal
Floral arrangement 
Stereogram cabinet
Walnut veneer 
True reproduction
No one can hear

San Simeon
San Simeon

Tigerskin rug love
I stroke - you bite me
Executive leather
Upholstered tightly
In the next room
Cocktails at seven
Soft lights, sweet music
Lounge thru' eleven
Just walk in the garden
French windows open
Patio paving
Concrete and crazy
Roses in blossom
They're doing well this year
Geranium pattern
Shrub topiary
Lie on my lush lawn
Waterfall bubbles
Drink at my fountain
Forget all your troubles
Forget all your troubles
Forget all your troubles

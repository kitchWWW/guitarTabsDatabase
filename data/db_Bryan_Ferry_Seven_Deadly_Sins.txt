You've seen it all before you[/tab]
You know the truth can be unkind
You fear the worst is hiding
It's when you lose your mind

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]E(7)[/ch]
All I hear is chimes at midnight[/tab]
Only seven deadly sins
All I hear is chimes at midnight
Only seven deadly sins

You hear the words denying
You can't believe but you try
When you long for what you don't have
It's why you live and die

All I hear is chimes at midnight
Only seven deadly sins
All I hear is chimes at midnight
Only seven deadly sins

as intro x2

You say your love is endless
But jealousy is blind
As we speak I rage and tremble
I must be sure that you're mine

All I hear is chimes at midnight
Only seven deadly sins
All I hear is chimes at midnight
Only seven deadly sins ...

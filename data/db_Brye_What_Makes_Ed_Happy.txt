[ED]

[Verse 1]
[tab] [ch]E[/ch]
Bored With My Life[/tab]

Tired Of The Sea

I Sought You Out

You Were Injured And Weak
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
And When You Awoke[/tab]

You Asked For My Name

It Wasn’t A Joke

But Funny All The Same


[Verse 2]
[tab] [ch]E[/ch]
And My God, You Are Funny[/tab]

A Gentleman Too

Like A Golden Retriever Puppy

So Endearing And Aloof
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
And You Treat Me With Kindness[/tab]

I’m Not Blackbeard To You

And It’s Weird To Say This

But I Think You’ve Broken Through


[Chorus 1]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]           [ch]G#m[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
No Man’s Made Me Feel[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]G#m[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
Like I’m Cared For, Like I Belong[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]G#m[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
And When No Ones Around I Stare At You[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#m[/ch]           [ch]G#m[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
For A Couple Seconds Too Long[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#m[/ch]                [ch]G#m[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
I’ve Never Been Scared In My Life[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m[/ch]                 [ch]G#m[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
But I’m Terrified To Tell You The Truth[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]      [ch]G#m[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
If I’m Being Honest Though[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#m[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]
What Makes Ed Happy Is You[/tab]


[STEDE]

[Verse 3]
[tab] [ch]E[/ch]
Bored With My Life[/tab]

Aching For The Sea

I Fled From My Wife

Like I Flee From Everything
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
I Felt Like A Coward Sometimes I Still Do[/tab]

But That Feelings Been Subsiding

Ever Since I Met You


[Verse 4]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]
The Fiercest Pirate[/tab]

That Anyone’s Ever Seen

You’re My Partner, My Co-captain

And You Believe In Me
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
I’ve Watched You Soften[/tab]

Like To Think I Broke Your Shell

And I Don’t Say It Often

But You Wear Fine Things So Well


[Chorus 2]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]           [ch]G#m[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
No One’s Made Me Feel[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F#m[/ch]         [ch]G#m[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
Like I’m Brave, Like I Am Strong[/tab]


[BOTH]
[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]                  [ch]G#m[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
And When You’re Not Around I Long For You[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#m[/ch]      [ch]G#m[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
Like I Have Never Longed[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]          [ch]G#m[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
I Don’t Think I Deserve[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]G#m[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
A Love Like You[/tab]


[STEDE]
[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]           [ch]G#m[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
But Since You Said It First[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]
You Make Stede Happy Too[/tab]

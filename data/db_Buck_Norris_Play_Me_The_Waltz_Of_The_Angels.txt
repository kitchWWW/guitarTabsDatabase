[ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                               
Played a party last night for some old folks,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
They were dancing and smiling at me,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]     
Saw this old man alone at a table, [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
As if there's someplace that he'd rather be,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]              
So I said Sir can I play something for you?  [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]   
Something special that you'd like to hear?[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]      
When he looked up at me he was smiling, [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
But his eye's couldn't hide all the tears,[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]    
He said play me the waltz of the Angels, [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]   
And I'll close my eyes and pretend,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]     
Play me the waltz of the Angels, [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
So I can dance with my Angel again.[/tab]

[Interlude]
[ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
[ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]     

[Verse 2]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]          
He said â€œyes that's a song I remember, [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
That's the one that she loved the best,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]   
It was played the night that I met her, [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
It was played when we laid her to rest,[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]  
So play me the Waltz of the Angels, [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
And I'll close my eyes and pretend,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]  
Play me the Waltz of the Angels, [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
So I can dance with my Angel again,[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
So I can dance with my Angel again. [/tab]

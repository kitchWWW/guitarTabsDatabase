Verse 2 - same as first verse

Well friends around me like to talk I guess they wanna know
If I'm gonna get a job or if I'm gonna sleep till noon
And all these people need to keep their mouth shut
Cause in the end the choice is mine
You never heard me asking you

Final verse

So I guess I know who my friends really are
All those times it came to stealing never let me go that far
And when you told me not to smoke it but I did
And it took me far away yeah it took me far away

Chorus - play last chorus a bunch of times

I spent lots of time playing this song
and tabbing it out, so I'll be damned if
there's a mistake in it. But if you find
one let me know. I'm open to suggestions
and requests. E - mail me at rdp@juno.com from
now on.

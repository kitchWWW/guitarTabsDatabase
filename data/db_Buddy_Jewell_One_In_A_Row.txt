[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Dsus2[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
Am I dreaming, or is that the morning sunlight shining in[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Dsus2[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G/B[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
I can't believe it, I was so sure my world was comin' to an end[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]Dsus2[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]               
I may never live to see the day your memory lets me go[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]-[ch]A[/ch]
But I made it through the night, and that's one in a row      (my heart's...)[/tab]
 
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Dsus2[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
My heart's still beatin, even though it's broken right in two[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]Dsus2[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G/B[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
So the odds are even, there's still some hope that I'll get over you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]D/F#[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]    
Will I make it through the day, girl it's hard to say I just don't know[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
But I made it through the night, and that's one in a row[/tab]


[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
One less endless night without you[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
Missin' everything about you until dawn[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m7[/ch]
One more sunrise to remind me[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
To leave yesterday behind me cause it's gone[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Dsus2[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
This is only the beginning and I've got a lifetime to go[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
But I made it through the night, and that's one in a row[/tab]


[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]D/F#[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]    
Will I make it through the day, girl it's hard to say I just don't know[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
But I made it through the night, and that's one in a row[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah I made it through the night, and that's one in a row[/tab]

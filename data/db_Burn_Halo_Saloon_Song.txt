[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                           [ch]B[/ch]
It was raining when I walked through the door[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                             [ch]B[/ch]
I didn't know that I'd find what I was looking for[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                  
I saw you there from across the room[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                              
Through the haze and the smoke of that old saloon[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]
I tried looking away but I just had to stay[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]        [ch]B[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
They say that time keeps flying on by[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C#m[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
But I keep thinking bout that first night[/tab]



[tab][ch]E[/ch]         [ch]B[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
I saw you smiling knew I had to talk to you [/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Had to swallow my pride[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
I heard you telling all your friends you met someone[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]
And how we talked all night[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]                                 [ch]E[/ch]
And I still hear you, and I still see you after all this time[/tab]

[ch]E[/ch]-[ch]B[/ch]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                      [ch]B[/ch]
I sat down and bought you one more drink[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                          [ch]B[/ch]
Listened to you talk, I swear I could hear you think[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                      
So I asked you "Could I see you again?"[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                
You just laughed and grabbed my hand[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]B[/ch]
You've been holding on tight, ever since that night[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]        [ch]B[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
They say that time keeps flying on by[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C#m[/ch]         [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
But if I'm with you that's alright.[/tab]

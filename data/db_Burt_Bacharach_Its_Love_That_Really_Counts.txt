(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo) (x2) [/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C7[/ch]           [ch]F6[/ch]
Some other guy may give me diamonds and pearls [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]C7[/ch]           [ch]F6[/ch]
The kind of things that mean so much to some girls [/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                              [ch]G7[/ch]        
But in the long run, baby, it's love that really counts [/tab]
Believe me, it's love that really counts and baby, 
[tab]                                             [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C7[/ch]   [ch]F6[/ch]
After loving you I'm here to say that no one else will do [/tab]

Who cares if you don't show me Paris or Rome? 
As long as you are here, I'm happy at home 
'Cause in the long run, baby, it's love that really counts 
Believe me, it's love that really counts when other loves have come and gone 
This love of ours will soon go on and on 

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]F6[/ch]
So take me in your arms, and darling [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]\[ch]E[/ch]                               [ch]F6[/ch]
Kiss me like only you know how to do [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]                       [ch]G7[/ch]
It's love that really counts, love that really counts [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
I'm tellin' you [/tab]

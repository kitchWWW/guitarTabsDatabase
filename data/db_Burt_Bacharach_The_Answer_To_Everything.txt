[tab][ch]C#[/ch]          [ch]G#[/ch]             [ch]C#[/ch]       [ch]G#[/ch]
Don't ask me a mountain of questions[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#[/ch]       [ch]F#[/ch]           [ch]G#7[/ch]
When there is only one answer to it all[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#[/ch]              [ch]G#7[/ch]     [ch]C#[/ch]        [ch]F#[/ch]
Do you love me, really love me as I love you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#[/ch]        [ch]G#[/ch]                [ch]C#[/ch]     [ch]G#[/ch]
It's the answer to everything if you do[/tab]

Don't give me a million excuses
When I am waiting with my arms open wide
Do you love me, really love me as I love you
It's the answer to everything if you do

[tab]            [ch]G#[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]Bbm[/ch]
If there is someone else, some other place who holds your heart [/tab]
[tab][ch]D#7[/ch]          [ch]G#[/ch]            [ch]G#7[/ch]
Tell me now, truthfully, before we start[/tab]

Don't act like you misunderstand me
When there is simply no mystery to it all
Do you love me, really love me as I love you
It's the answer to everything if you do

[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
I've felt pain before[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
But nothing's quite like this[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
I don't know why[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
You left so quick[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
And I've felt pain before[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
But nothing as severe as this[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
I don't know why[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
It ended so quick[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Have you ever looked someone[/tab]

you loved in the eyes
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
And told them just how you feel[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
I wish I did[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
I wish I did[/tab]


Have you ever
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
looked someone you loved in the eyes[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
And told them just how you feel[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
I wish I did[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Before it was too late[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And you were taken away[/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh[/tab]


[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
And I've felt pain before[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
But nothing's quite like this[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
I don't know why[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
You left so quick[/tab]


[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
And I've felt pain before[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
But nothing as severe as this[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
I don't know why[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
It ended so quick[/tab]


[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
Have you ever looked someone[/tab]

you loved in the eyes
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
And told them just how you feel[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
I wish I did[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
I wish I did[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Have you ever looked someone[/tab]

you loved in the eyes
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
And told them just how you feel[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
I wish I did[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Before it was too late[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And you were taken away[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
And now it's too late[/tab]

And I missed my chance
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Cause I was too young to know[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
How my story would go[/tab]

[tab]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
And now you're gone forever[/tab]

And I'm struggling to keep you at bay
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Cause you keep slipping away[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
I can't remember the features[/tab]

of your glowing face
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Or the sound of your voice[/tab]

Or the way you
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
taught me to learn[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]
from mistakes[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]
But If I could turn back time[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
I would look you in the eyes[/tab]

And tell you

[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]
Just how I feel[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
Just how I feel[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
Just how I feel[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
Just how I feel Ahhh Oooh[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
Have you ever looked someone[/tab]

you loved in the eyes
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
And told them just how you feel[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
I wish I did[/tab]

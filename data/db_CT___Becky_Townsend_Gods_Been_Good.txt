God's been good in my life[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
I've been blessed beyond my wildest dreams[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
As I go to sleep each night[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Sure I've had my share of hard times,[/tab]

I've had more gains than losses, and I've known more joy than hurt[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am7[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
As His grace fell around me undeserved.[/tab]

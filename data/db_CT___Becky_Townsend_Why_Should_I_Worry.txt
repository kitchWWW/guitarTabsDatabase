[Verse 1]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
Out on the waters[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C/B[/ch]
storms raging high,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
The waters around them[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
They were troubled that night,[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]
Fear filled their hearts[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
they felt they would die,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
They failed to remember[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
that the Master was nigh,[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Then He spoke the words[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
and The winds all stood still[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
You See Even the waters[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am/G[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]
They obey His will,[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]
Then He calmed their storm[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Just like He will mine,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
If I just remember[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
He lives deep inside [/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
So Why should I worry[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C/B[/ch]
why should I fear,[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
When the very same Jesus[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am/G[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]
 He is always so near,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
He lives in my heart[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
 and He hears when I cry,[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]
I'll call on His name[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
till the storm passes by [/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
 We read in the bible[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
 when He walked with them,[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
Brought light to the darkness [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am/G[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]
when the way grew dim,[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]
How great it would be[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
 to have his footsteps in mine,[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]
And walk with the master[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
 all of the time,[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]
And when trials come[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C/B[/ch]
 and death seems so nigh,[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
I'll call on the master[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Am/G[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
 I know he'll get there on time,[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]
And when sickness comes[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
 and my body's in pain[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
All I have to do is[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
 call on his name [/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
So Why should I worry[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C/B[/ch]
why should I fear,[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
When the very same Jesus[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am/G[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]
 He is always so near,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
He lives in my heart[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
 and He hears when I cry,[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]
I'll call on His name[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
till the storm passes by [/tab]

[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]

Just Call On His Name[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Till The Storm Passes By[/tab]

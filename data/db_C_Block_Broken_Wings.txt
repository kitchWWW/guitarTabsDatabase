[tab]             [ch]Fsus2[/ch]
And learn to fly again[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
And learn to live so free[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Gsus2[/ch]
And when we hear the voices sing[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Fsus2[/ch]
The book of love will open up[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
And let us in[/tab]

[Rap 1]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Creepin' for the microphone[/tab]
With C-Block we didn't clean
Floors of funky thing
The devil misses T you're goin' G
We rip the ship, we rap the ship
We lay 'n attractive flip a script
Drop a lyric, do some slowin'
Check the micro to the phone
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
We be here and we'll be back[/tab]
Double it, we can't go back
Tisci, tasci cop the hammer blast it
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Homos tryin' to flex you rest in pain[/tab]
In the casket
You're takin' the chance
Of rollin' the dice
You lose your luck, you lose your life
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Check yourself puff[/tab]
Before I reck your desk punk
[tab]      [ch]Gsus2[/ch]
Don't make me act to take you for[/tab]
A ride in my trunk
[tab]         [ch]Gm[/ch]
I said excuses, excuses[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Gsus2[/ch]
I'm not tryin' to hear this fellows boom[/tab]
But make ya, so get on that seat
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]
You said you couldn't wreck the mic[/tab]
But you came too late.
You said you could a hype the crowd
But you do sound fake
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]
You would have stept onto the stage[/tab]
But you was getting get slammed
You knew you could have shifted
But you didn't, damn

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Gsus2[/ch]
Take these broken wings[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Fsus2[/ch]
And learn to fly again[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
And learn to live so free[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Gsus2[/ch]
And when we hear the voices sing[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Fsus2[/ch]
The book of love will open up[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
And let us in[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Cm[/ch]
So take these broken wings[/tab]

[Rap 2]
[tab]       [ch]Gm[/ch]
Broken wings, fatalistic[/tab]
Got another statistic
In the jungle scene go balistic
Realistically the buck stops
On an instant child
[tab]                                          [ch]F[/ch]
With the words can spoken from a wise man[/tab]
A sister made a great dictator
On it uneducated
And then went faithful brothers
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
When they infiltrated[/tab]
So it goes to the blaze like Bombay
Threatened with the sashe to doomsday
[tab]    [ch]Gm[/ch]
For safe. No wonder this went session[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Gsus2[/ch]
Over to the positive[/tab]
So listen closely to the message
[tab]                     [ch]Gm[/ch]
That I'm gonna give[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]Gsus2[/ch]
I refuse to misuse my god given talent[/tab]
And in so to diffuse
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]
On those metabolic[/tab]
And if you seem to take your life
Upon another status
You need to believe to get a thing
[tab]                           [ch]C[/ch]
You need to give to get it[/tab]
And when you're strugg'ling in this game
You put your head up high
You use some fundamental wings to fly

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Gsus2[/ch]
Take these broken wings[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Fsus2[/ch]
And learn to fly again[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
And learn to live so free[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Gsus2[/ch]
And when we hear the voices sing[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Fsus2[/ch]
The book of love will open up[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
And let us in[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Cm[/ch]
So take these broken wings[/tab]

Derek: clean guitar (Capo-3)
------

Intro:

[tab]--0-0---0--0----0-0---0-0-0---|
--3-3---1--1----3-3---1-1-1---|
--4-4---2--2----4-4---2-2-2---|
--5-5---3--0----5-5---3-0-0---|
--5-5---3--3----5-5---3-3-3---|
--3-3---1--0----3-3---1-0-0---|[/tab]

Just repeat this over and over.

The best way to finger this:
2nd string: 1st finger
3rd string: 2nd finger
4th string: 3rd finger
5th string: 4th finger
6th string: loop thumb over

It will take time to get used to pulling that 3rd finger up, just keep
practicing. It will come.

Verse 1:
--------
The changes are really fast, so I'm not gonna put chords over words.
I will put the part, it is only 4 strums, and it is just repeated over
and over. Work on playing it muted, it sounds better. Also, in the middle
of each verse, one riff of the intro is thrown in. It is obvious when you
listen to the record.

--0h2------2-2--2---|
--0--------3-3--0---|
--x--------3-3--3---|
--3--------1-1--0---|[/tab]

The best fingering for these:
First one, the one like a G:
1st string: 4th finger
2nd string: 3rd finger
6th string: 2nd finger, also muting 5th string
3rd string: (the hammer) 1st string

Verse 1:
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Before there was time[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
There were visions in Your mind[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]Em[/ch]
There was death in the fall of mankind[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]G[/ch] 
But there was life in salvation's design[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Before there were days[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]A[/ch] 
There were nights I could not see Your face[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]Em[/ch]
But the night could not keep me from grace[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
When You came and took my place[/tab]

Chorus
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch] 
So I cry holy only begotten Son of God[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
Ancient of days[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch] 
I cry holy only begotten Son of God[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]
And sing the praises[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch] 
Of the One who saved me[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
And the promises He made[/tab]

Verse 2:
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Before there was time[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]A[/ch]
You counted the hairs on my head[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Em[/ch]
You knew all the words that I've said[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
And You purchased me back from the dead[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
Before I was made[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]A[/ch]
You searched me and knew my ways[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
You numbered all my days[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]G[/ch] 
And You set forth the steps I would take[/tab]

(Chorus)

Bridge:
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Bm[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
You saved me; You raised me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
You saved me; You pulled me from the grave[/tab]

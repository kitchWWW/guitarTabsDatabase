[Intro]

[ch]Em9[/ch]

[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]                      [ch]C2[/ch]                            [ch]D2[/ch]      [ch]G5[/ch]  [ch]D2/F#[/ch]
Thank God I'm back in my car, and drivin' home, and drivin' home.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]                         [ch]C2[/ch]                [ch]D2[/ch]
'Cause the air was thin and so cold back in there.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em7[/ch]                     [ch]A7sus[/ch]
It was my first time, won't be my last time[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C2[/ch]                   [ch]D2[/ch]                          [ch]Em9[/ch]
And the questions rise, expectations fall in light of it all.[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C2[/ch]               [ch]D2[/ch]          [ch]G5[/ch]      [ch]D2/F#[/ch]
There aren't words to say; words aren't remembered, but presensce is.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]                    [ch]C2[/ch]               [ch]D2[/ch]             [ch]Em7[/ch]
A good friend once told me, and he was there, he was there[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A7sus4[/ch]             [ch]C2[/ch]                 [ch]D2[/ch]
But she wasn't there.  And it's not fair, and it's not fair.[/tab]

[Chorus 1]

[tab][ch]G5[/ch]                [ch]G/F#[/ch]      [ch]Em7[/ch]                    [ch]D2[/ch]
What crimes have you committed, demanding such a penance,[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C2[/ch]                                [ch]G5[/ch]
that couldn't wait for five more minutes and a cry for help?[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G/F#[/ch]       [ch]Em7[/ch]                      [ch]D2[/ch]
'Cause this room is so peaceful and this room is so quiet.[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Em7[/ch]                [ch]C2[/ch]               [ch]Em9[/ch]
And I hate the silence, and I can't walk the center aisle.[/tab]

[Verse 2]

Em9                              C2add4
Well, I've been here for over three hours,
[tab][ch]D2[/ch]                     [ch]G5[/ch]   [ch]D2/F#[/ch]
           behind the flowers,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]                 [ch]C2[/ch]          [ch]D2[/ch]               [ch]Em7[/ch]
so beautiful and young.  And so alive, and so in need of someone,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A7sus4[/ch]                           [ch]C2[/ch]
someone to talk to them.  'Cause theirs are fragile lives.[/tab]

[Chorus 1]

[tab][ch]G5[/ch]                [ch]G/F#[/ch]      [ch]Em7[/ch]                    [ch]D2[/ch]
What crimes have you committed, demanding such a penance,[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C2[/ch]                              [ch]G5[/ch]
that couldn't wait for five more minutes and a cry for help?[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G/F#[/ch]    [ch]Em7[/ch]                        [ch]D2[/ch]
'Cause this room is so peaceful and this room is so quiet.[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Em7[/ch]                [ch]C2[/ch]               [ch]Em9[/ch]
And I hate the silence, and I can't walk the center aisle.[/tab]

[Bridge]

[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]                  [ch]A7sus4[/ch]
And I think about my brother,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]                  [ch]A7sus4[/ch]
and how I just stood there[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]                   [ch]A7sus4[/ch]                  [ch]C2[/ch]
with my hands in my pockets and my heart in my throat.[/tab]

[Verse 3]

[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]                     [ch]C2[/ch]                 [ch]D2[/ch]                [ch]G5[/ch]   [ch]D2/F#[/ch]
Thank God I'm back in my car and drivin' home, and drivin' home.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]                 [ch]C2[/ch]            [ch]D2[/ch]            [ch]Em7[/ch]
But in that place I leave all my days of taking life for granted[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A7sus4[/ch]            [ch]Em7[/ch]                           [ch]A7sus4[/ch]
and the words I wrote for her and my best friend crying,[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C2[/ch]
and a young girl lying on all our hearts.[/tab]

[Chorus 2]

[tab][ch]G5[/ch]                [ch]G/F#[/ch]      [ch]Em7[/ch]                    [ch]D2[/ch]
What crimes have you committed, demanding such a penance,[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C2[/ch]                              [ch]G5[/ch]
that couldn't wait for five more minutes and a cry for help?[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G/F#[/ch]    [ch]Em7[/ch]                        [ch]D2[/ch]
'Cause this room is so peaceful and this room is so quiet.[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Em7[/ch]
And I hate the silence[/tab]
[tab][ch]C2[/ch]               [ch]Em7[/ch]                [ch]C2[/ch]              [ch]Em9[/ch]
And I hate the silence, and I can't walk down the center aisle.[/tab]

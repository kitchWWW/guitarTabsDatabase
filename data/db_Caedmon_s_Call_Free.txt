This song is so good...


Entire song (except bridge)
E - G#m - A - Am


Verse 1
Around my neck is a beautiful stone
I made it from the good that I've done
It is close to my heart with a meter of its own
but the weight it bears on me from the good I want to be
it cuts me in half, a blade, a sword, a golden calf


Verse 2
Now I am sinking under the load. I see it was only fool's gold
And it falls on me, brings me low
Around His neck He carries the stone
He takes my burden, makes it His own
And it takes Him down, the bread, the wine, the golden crown


Chorus
Free

Verse 3
A rose shoots up from the ground
the sky cracks open, sun through the clouds
the old has changed, the earth, the bride, the family name


Bridge
F#m            G#m             A              B
Broken down and shot through, all the good I mean to do
the prison shakes, the man goes free, I am Him and He is me

Chorus


[tab]Little lead riff played on the cello and xylephone. Sounds pretty good on a
guitar with some swells and delay.

mute the E string)

Artist: Caedmon's Call
Song: Sing His Love
Genre: 
Key: 


This song has a nice little fingerpicking intro that's pretty easy to learn. Couldn't find a tab for
it so I decided to make my own. It's played in Ab so I play it in Eb tuning but feel feel free to
capo up or experiment with different keys. Enjoy!

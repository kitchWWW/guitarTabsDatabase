You know that woman with the gold-capped tooth[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B7[/ch]

[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]
It smelled like turpentine, it looked like India ink[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]E7[/ch]
I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
I didn't know if it was day or night[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                        [ch]Am[/ch]
But when I kissed a cop down on 34th and Vine[/tab]

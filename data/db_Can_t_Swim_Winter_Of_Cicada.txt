[Verse 1]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]
I made some plans[/tab]

And wrote them down

For both of us
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
They're in a book[/tab]

Beneath my bed

With a photo on the front
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
The pages read[/tab]

Of things we'd see

The ones you wanted most
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
I'd take you to the places that[/tab]

I always said we'd go


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
   And how can I be sure it gets better?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
   I've written every word, every letter[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
   I just want to be wherever you are[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Sure I can be whatever you want[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]E[/ch]
I know it's harder to give than to get[/tab]

You get what you give

And that's it
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]
   I just want to be,   I just want to be[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]
A kid I was[/tab]

A teenager

A foolish one
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
The polo shirt[/tab]

I'd always wear

You begged me to rip up
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
You pierced my nose[/tab]

I shaved your head

You came to all my shows
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
And everyone would always say[/tab]

"Don't ever let her go"


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
   And how can I be sure it gets better?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
   I've written every word, every letter[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]
   I just want to be wherever you are[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Sure I can be whatever you want[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]E[/ch]
I know it's harder to give than to get[/tab]

You get what you give

And that's it


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
   You just need me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
But I wasn't there[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
I know I never treated you fair[/tab]

And how much longer
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Will I regret[/tab]

Taking the bet

That you'd quit?
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
   I just want to be[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
So rip me apart[/tab]

And put me right back

How you want
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
   You just needed me[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
   You just needed me[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab]                 [ch]C#m[/ch]
So how can I maintain?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
You occupy my brain[/tab]

But still I wait for you
[tab]                        [ch]E[/ch]
It's the best that I can do[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C#m[/ch]
So dress me head to toe[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Prepare me for the cold[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
The longest winter yet[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]C#m[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
Forever in regret[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]C#m[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
Forever in regret[/tab]
[ch]E[/ch]

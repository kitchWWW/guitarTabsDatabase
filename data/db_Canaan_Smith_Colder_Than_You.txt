[Verse 1]
N.C.
I found a note on the fridge
[tab]N.C.                              [ch]Em[/ch]
Said, "I'm sorry, this just ain't workin'"[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
And since you ain't here, and there's frost on the beer[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
I guess you weren't talkin' 'bout the frigidaire, girl.[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Nah, you never liked my mom, or my dog, or my friends[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
And the worst is[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
I never said one word[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
When you told me to turn down the Merle[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                              [ch]Em[/ch]
But I might've finally found somethin' colder than you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
Well, I'm happy as hell, and hell, it helps me raise it[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
Took your goodbye, and hell, it done erased it[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Girl, I ain't drownin' your memory, these mountains[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
Are all that's in here gettin' blue[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
Baby, I might've finally found somethin' colder than you[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, we're better together, and that's somethin'[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
They never once said when they'd talk about us[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
But it don't leave a note when it's runnin' out[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
It just leaves a buzz, you ain't here to kill mine[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                              [ch]Em[/ch]
But I might've finally found somethin' colder than you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
Well, I'm happy as hell, and hell, it helps me raise it[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
Took your goodbye, and hell, it done erased it[/tab]

A twelve-pack of cold ones[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause that's somethin' I ain't ever[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]

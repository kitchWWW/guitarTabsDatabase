Artist: Capital Kings
Song: Youll Never Be Alone
Genre: 
Key: 


This song is usually a dub-step song. It's always fun to make an interesting 
rendition to it though. It won't be completely perfect, since the original has no 
guitar, but nevertheless, enjoy, and God Bless!!! 

(Capo 1)

Hey, let me start it off by saying this
 You mean everything to me, nothin' I wouldn't risk
 Every single second or moment that passes by
 I'm thinkin' about you and really want you to know that
 There's something more out there
 Something that will hold you very tight when you're scared
 Cause I know when times get tough, and it starts to feel rough
 It can feel like everything's crashin' down on ya

[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
There is hope, let me show...[/tab]

Man, crazy how you got this far
 I'd be sittin' just wonderin' where to start
 Last week you were sayin' that somethin' just ain't right
 Layin' in your bed stayin' up all night cause
 This life is harder than it seems
 But one thing I've learned is never stop chasin' your dreams
 And if it ever gets too hectic for you, stop for a second
 And remember one thing...

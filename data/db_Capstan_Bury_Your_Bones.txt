[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
I hope my absence haunts you like a ghost[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Eating away at you from time to time[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
I know I’m absent from your life and mind but you still haunt mine[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
There’s a different kind of emptiness you left me with after all of this[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
And I can’t wrap my head around the fact that you’re not coming back[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
There’s a chemical imbalance that you left inside my brain[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                          [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]
You’re the reason why the alcohol is still rotting in my veins[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
I’ll be ok this is something I can get through[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
But I don’t know if I can say the same about you[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                                                 [ch]G[/ch]
I know a world of stability is all that you could ever see and when everything falls apart[/tab]

Dear God I know it’ll fall apart
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
I hope you buckle at your knees and think of me[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
I’ll leave you with this emptiness as your parting gift[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
These heavy words I know you can’t lift[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
(Between the two of you there’ll be a common rift)[/tab]

And thats me. The problem you can’t fix
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
The chemicals have balanced as I’m writing off your name[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                                                           [ch]F[/ch]
I hope the thought of us and broken trust stays frozen in his brain[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
I’ll be ok this is something I can get through[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
But I don’t know if I can say the same about you[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Truth be told we are not the same[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
A future sold that was built on blame[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]
I pray you can’t bear the guilt and shame[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
I’ll stay a thorn in your side that’s worn with pain[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Day in day out it won’t get better[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
Even your friends say forever fair-weather[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]F[/ch]
Stay stuck. You’re a stormy sky with an idle mind you deserve each other[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
And I’ve been picking you apart in my head[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
Trying to see between you and me if there was anything worth keeping[/tab]
I’m empty handed once again

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
    Constant consent. You lied to him about the time we spent.[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
Relapse. Repent. Your judgement lapse came and went.[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
You said that life was built on compromise[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]
A statement laced with fraying ties on borrowed time you’ll never find[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
So in the end you took what was yours and stole what was mine.[/tab]

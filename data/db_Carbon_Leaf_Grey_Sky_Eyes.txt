Artist: Carbon Leaf
Song: Grey Sky Eyes
Genre: 
Key: 


i saw that they tabbed Dadd9 and G/B differently then i thought, play them

Dadd9- same form as C chord just move down 2 frets so x504030 (C is x32010)

G/B- very easy, x2003x    P.S. and G is played 32033


( You may have seen this song differently but this is how you really play it)

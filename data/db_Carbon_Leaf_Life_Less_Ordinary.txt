[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Live a life less ordinary[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Live a life extraordinary with me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Live a life less sedentary[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]C[/ch]
Live a life evolutionary with me[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
Well, I hate to be a bother[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]C[/ch]
But it's you and there's no other I do believe[/tab]

You can call me naive but
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
I know me very well, at least as far as I can tell[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
And I know what I need[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
The night you came into my life[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
Well, it took the bones of me, took the bones of me[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
You blew away my storm and strife[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
And shook the bones of me, shook the bones of me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
By the way I do know why you stayed away[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
I will keep tongue tied next time[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Live a life less ordinary[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Live a life extraordinary with me[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
My face had said too much before our hands could even touch[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]
To greet a hello so much for going slow[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
A little later on that year I told you that I loved you dear[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
What do you know, this you weren't prepared to hear[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
I'm a saddened man, I'm a broken boy, I'm a toddler with a complex toy[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
I'm fallin' apart since the ambush on your heart[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
The night you came into my life[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
Well, it took the bones of me, took the bones of me[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
You blew away my storm and strife[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
And shook the bones of me, shook the bones of me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
By the way I do know why you stayed away[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
I will keep tongue tied but[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Honey understand, honey understand[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
I won't make demands[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Honey understand, honey understand[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
We could walk without a plan[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Honey understand, honey, honey understand[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
I won't rest in stone all alone[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Honey understand, honey understand[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
I'm all ready to go but you already know[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Live a life less ordinary[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Live a life extraordinary with me[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
If I could name you in this song would it make you smile and sing along[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
This is the goal, to get into your soul[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
If I could make you dance for joy could that be the second chance decoy[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
The bird-in-hand I would need to help you understand[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
The night you came into my life[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
Well, it took the bones of me, took the bones of me[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
You blew away my storm and strife[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
And shook the bones of me, shook the bones of me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
By the way I do know why you stayed away[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
I will keep tongue tied next time[/tab]

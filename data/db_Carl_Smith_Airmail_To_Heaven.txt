[tab][ch]C[/ch]
A letter was written by a little girl's hand[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
It was sealed with her little heart's love[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G7[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Said airmail to heaven to daddy[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D7[/ch]                    [ch]G7[/ch]
To your new home somewhere up above[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
As a postman I knew that it couldn't be mailed[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
And so I opened the letter and I read[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
To my surprise tears filled my eyes[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G7[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Here's what the little girl said[/tab]


Dear daddy mommy now loves someone new
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
She says that you're not coming home[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G7[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
She told me to try to understand[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D7[/ch]                  [ch]G7[/ch]
She can't go on living alone[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
Please daddy don't be mad at mommy[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
She needs someone for all she's been through[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
Cause he will never take your place[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G7[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
He'll be just filling in for you[/tab]


I hope that you can forgive her
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
So I'm sealing this letter with love[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G7[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
And I'm sending it airmail to heaven[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D7[/ch]                    [ch]G7[/ch]
To your new home somewhere up above[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Well I finished and I folded the letter[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
The tears rolling down my face[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
For I was the new man she mentioned[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G7[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Who was taking her daddy's place[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
For I was the new man she mentioned[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G7[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Who was taking her daddy's place[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
On the cross of Calvary our blessed Savior died[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]G7[/ch]
Gave His life to save the world from loss[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
In His pain and agony for every sin to hide[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]G7[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]                                                   [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Twas His blood His precious blood that stained the old rugged cross[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]G7[/ch]
Twas His love that paid the awful cost[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
Oh soul so far astray come and plunge today[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]G7[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
In the blood that stained the old rugged cross[/tab]

To the cross the rugged cross they nailed His precious hands[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G7[/ch]
And in death He fully paid the cost[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]

For the blood that stained the old rugged cross[/tab]

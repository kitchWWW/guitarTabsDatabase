[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
One day on a bright April morning[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]G[/ch]
As the sun stretched over the sky[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
Stood a Man with His hands tied behind Him[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Awaiting His sentence to die[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
The birds hushed their singing at daybreak[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]
For Christ had His place to fulfill[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
From a lovely bright mansion in Heaven[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
To a cross on a lonely dark hill[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Just ahead lay the mountain of Calvary[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
Where He must drink from sins bitter cup[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
One could hear hammers ring in the stillness[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Then the soldiers were lifting Him up[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
The birds hushed their singing at daybreak[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]
For Christ had His place to fulfill[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
From a lovely bright mansion in Heaven[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
To a cross on a lonely dark hill[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
The birds hushed their singing at daybreak[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]C#m[/ch]   [ch]C#m[/ch]   [ch]C#m[/ch]   [ch]C#m[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]               [ch]C#m[/ch]
From where you are. You see the smoke start to arise[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G#7[/ch]
Where they play cards And you walk over[/tab]

Softly moving passed the guards The stakes are getting higher
[tab]                        [ch]C#m[/ch]
You can feel it in your heart[/tab]

He calls you bluff He is the ace you never thought
[tab]               [ch]G#7[/ch]
He played that much And now it's more than all this cards[/tab]

You want to touch You never know if winning this
[tab]           [ch]C#m[/ch]
Could really be enough[/tab]


[Pre Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]Adim7[/ch]           [ch]G#7[/ch]              [ch]C#m[/ch] 
Take a look Beyond the moon You see the stars.[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Adim7[/ch]         [ch]G#7[/ch]              [ch]C#[/ch]
And when you look around You know the room by heart[/tab]
      
[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]D#m7[/ch]                    [ch]G#7[/ch]                 [ch]C#[/ch]
I have never dreamed it Have you ever dreamed a night like this[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D#m7[/ch]                   [ch]G#7[/ch]              [ch]C#[/ch]
I cannot believe it I may never see a night like this[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D#m7[/ch]        [ch]G#7[/ch]
When everything you think is incomplete[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C#[/ch]
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Adim7[/ch]                   [ch]G#7[/ch]                          [ch]C#m[/ch]
Could you ever dream that I have never dreamed, dreamed a night like this[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]         [ch]C#m[/ch]
How many times[/tab]

Have I been waiting by the door
[tab]              [ch]G#7[/ch]
To hear these chimes[/tab]

To hear that someone debonaire has just a arrived
[tab]                        [ch]C#m[/ch]
And opened up to see My world before my eyes[/tab]

That silhouette creates an image
[tab]                       [ch]G#7[/ch]
On the night I can't forget[/tab]

It has the scent of something special

I can't rest If I resist temptation
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]
Oh, I know for sure that I will lose the bet[/tab]


[Pre chorus]
[tab]   [ch]Adim7[/ch]                    [ch]G#7[/ch]           [ch]C#m[/ch]
I walk away and suddenly it seems I'm not alone[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Adim7[/ch]                  [ch]G#7[/ch]             [ch]C#[/ch]
In front of me he stands I stop, before he goes[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]G#7[/ch]                                          [ch]C#[/ch]
I have never dreamed it Have you ever dreamed a night like this[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G#7[/ch]                                   [ch]C#[/ch]
I cannot believe it I may never see a night like this[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G#7[/ch]
When everything you think is incomplete[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C#[/ch]
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Adim7[/ch]                                                [ch]C#m[/ch]

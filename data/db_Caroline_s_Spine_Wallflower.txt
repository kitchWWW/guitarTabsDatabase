G* C* Em* C*

  G*                       C*               Em*            C*
I could have died, maybe I should have died when I saw you walk inside
    G*                             C*                           Em*                      
 C*
And as you shut the door, I put my eyes back on the floor, when all I really wanted was 
look some more

       A*                         C*                    G*    C*
Does a wallflower play, or does a wallflower stay on his wall?

          G*                   C*                  Em*                          C*
You see I live alone, but I've made my happy home, all my furniture is centered around 
my phone
    G*                             C*                   Em*                             C*
I'm waiting for the call, my imaginary friends and all, those who would never let me be 
by the fall

       A*                         C*                 G*    C*
Does a wallflower know, when it's time he outgrow his wall?
               A*                          C*                      E5    F#5 C5 A5
Tell me does a wallflower know, when it's about time he outgrow his wall?
       E5   F#5 C5 A5
Yeah his wall

E5 F#5 C5 A5 (play lead rythm fill over these 2 lines)
E5 F#5 C5 A5

E5                F#5                C5            A5
 Time and time and time and time and only time has feeling for me
E5  F#5          C5                    A5
    Maybe, maybe father time will feel sorry for me
E5  F#5                     C5                 A5
  I knew, I knew when there was a time, when I knew it all
E5            F#5            C5               A5            E5
  Why don't I ever leave my wall? Why don't I ever leave my wall?
            F#5           C5                 A5            E5  F#5  C5  A5
Why don't I ever leave my wall? Please don't ever leave my wall, my wall

G* (repeat several times main rythm-just the G* portion)

              G*                               C*
You know that siren's getting louder and these people are starting to crowd in on me
Em*                                C*
All I smell and taste is garlic and gunpowder
        G*                            C*
Cause I shot the bad guy dead, but he got me in the head
            Em*                                         C*
Oh with the girl of my dreams she's mentioning to me how much I've bleed

             A*                        C*                          G*    C*
Where do the wallflower go, when their flowers get pulled from this wall?
                  A*                                   C*                      G*
Oh and though she says I'm brave and bold, she knows a flower cannot hold up a wall
        C*                    Em    D/F#    C     Asus
I can't hold up this wall any longer,   any longer
            Em               D/F#     C    Asus
Cause all I have is time and time and time
           Em                 D/F#             C
My only friend, time and time, please some more time
  Asus       Em        D/F#       C
I think I'm over,    I think I'm over,
Asus            Em  D/F# C Asus
    I think I'm ov  -    er

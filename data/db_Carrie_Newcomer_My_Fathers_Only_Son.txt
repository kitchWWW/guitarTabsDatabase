[ch]C[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]                                              [ch]Am[/ch]
It's a good excuse to watch the sun go down[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
On a gravel pit outside of town[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Am[/ch]
My father had three daughters[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
So I became his only son[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
Summertime in Allen County[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
You can slice the air like bread[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
Pack up our old Rambler[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G/B[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
With cane poles and little said[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
You never talk much in a fishing boat[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G/B[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
‘Cause it just scares the fish away[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
You just give it time and watch your line[/tab]

[Instrumental]
[ch]C[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]                                        [ch]Am[/ch]
When I'd ask what we were fishing for[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
He'd just say, “An hour or two”[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Some folks are always like that[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G/B[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
And never really answer you[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
You never talk much in a fishing boat[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G/B[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
‘Cause it just scares the fish away[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
You just give it time and watch your line[/tab]

[Instrumental]
[ch]C[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]                                          [ch]Am[/ch]
The sun goes down and why, no one knows[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
I grew up out of my fishing clothes[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]Am[/ch]
I told him once and he slowly smiled[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G/B[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]
That his only son was expecting a child[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
You never talk much in a fishing boat[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G/B[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
‘Cause it just scares the fish away[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
You just give it time and watch your line[/tab]

[Instrumental]
[ch]C[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
I'll remember all my life[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
My father's face in the deep twilight[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
In a boat under the evening sun[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G/B[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
Throwing back the little ones[/tab]

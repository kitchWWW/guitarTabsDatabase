[Verse 1]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
I knew when we first met[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
I saw it there in your eyes[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                                                [ch]A[/ch]
I was looking at you, you were looking at me there was no surprise[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
So I ordered us a round of cuervo[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
With some salt and lime[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
Then I woke up alone that morning stuck on Tulsa time[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
Ah maybe she's in Oklahoma, maybe she's on the move[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]A[/ch]
Maybe she's in paradise city look so pretty trying to find a groove[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
Maybe she's in Colorado or on a west bound train[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
Maybe she's in California on a beach it hurts the same[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
And if you're lonely baby I can make you smile[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
The distance that's between us is only miles[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]Bm[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
So baby come back to Oklahoma[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
I've been drinking to broken hearts[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
While I fall apart[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                                          [ch]A[/ch]
I could try to make things right, but I don't know where to start[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
And I keep looking at my phone, I feel so alone[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
And if you're staring down a highway I hope it leads you home[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
Ah maybe she's in Oklahoma, maybe she's on the move[/tab]

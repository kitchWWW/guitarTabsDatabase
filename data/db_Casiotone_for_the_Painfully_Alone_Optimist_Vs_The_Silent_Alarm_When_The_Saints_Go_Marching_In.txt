Genre:

Intro: [ch]C[/ch]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Oh there's skeletons of cigarettes and empty cans and bottles[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And we tear out of the parking lot, the engine at full throttle[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You mapped a route with all right turns so lights don't get us caught[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
We've got a mess of cash in duffel bags and every penny's hot[/tab]


[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]
Well hallelujah[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Well hallelujah[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
And we're laughing through the fear that we'll never make the clear[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Oh and you've never looked so dear, it's the end of our career[/tab]


[tab][ch]C[/ch]
We'll ditch the car in Wisconsin and hide out in the trees[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And I know a dude in Madison who owes some favors to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
With the money in the backseat, baby, we could buy a house[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And raise a little family on Shlitz and Mickey Mouse[/tab]


[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Well hallelujah[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Well hallelujah[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
And we're laughing through the fear that we'll never make the clear[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Oh and you've never looked so dear, it's the end of our career[/tab]


Outro: Follow the timing of the same chords as the song "When the Saints go 
Marching In" but without the lyrics:

[tab]"[ch]C[/ch]
Oh when the saints go marching in,[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]G[/ch]
Oh when the saints go marching in,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
Lord, I want to be in that number[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch] 
When the saints go marching in."[/tab]

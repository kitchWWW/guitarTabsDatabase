[Verse]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]A#[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
You don’t know if it’s hello or goodbye[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                                     [ch]A#[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
What kind of tears they are when they get cried[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]
All you know is somebody is coming or leaving[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
It don’t really matter whatever the reason[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                   [ch]A#[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
Something about them gets me every time[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
Kisses at airports, wide-open car doors[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A#[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
So slow to let go, wrapped up with eyes closed[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]Dm[/ch]
Some mean "I missed you," some mean "I’m going to"[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A#[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]  
But somehow they mean more, kisses at airports[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                                   [ch]A#[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
There was a crayon cardboard "Welcome home, Daddy" sign[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                               [ch]A#[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
When he got the deployed, she was just two pink lines[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]
And now it’s sunburned lips on ten little fingers[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And one for her mama, yeah, that one lingers[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                                   [ch]A#[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
I’m pretty sure I wasn’t the only one at baggage claim to cry[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
Kisses at airports, thanking the good Lord[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A#[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
You didn’t die out there without seeing that curly red hair[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
And that’s why you hang on and that’s how you make it home[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A#[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Got something to live for, kisses at airports[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]
When you dropped me off, I was running late[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
I just grabbed my bags and ran to the gate[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]
But what if I had never landed[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
How many times do we take for granted?[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
Kisses at airports, wide-open car doors[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A#[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
No I don’t want to let go, I just want to make sure you know[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]Dm[/ch]
This one means I miss you, this one means I’m going to[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A#[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Make every one I give you, baby, be a little more[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]Dm[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]
Like kisses at airports. Like kisses at airports [/tab]

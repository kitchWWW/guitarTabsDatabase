[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
  Hindsight is a funny thing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
  The more time goes the less[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Eb[/ch]
it stings  You go and[/tab]
tell everyone about me
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
  Like I was the best[/tab]
thing you'd ever seen


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
  Your glasses must[/tab]
be rose colored
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
  Your reality it[/tab]
must be blurred
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
  You act like there's[/tab]
only good things to say
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
  Like I'm the one[/tab]
that got away


[Chorus 1]
[tab]            [ch]Ab[/ch]
But I'm the one that[/tab]
you left high and dry
The one you loved
[tab]                [ch]Fm[/ch]
to make cry The one who[/tab]
let's be real you never
[tab]                [ch]Eb[/ch]
tried I was the promises[/tab]
you loved to break
The perfect plan
you never made
[tab]    [ch]Db[/ch]
Was all for none[/tab]
What's done is done
[tab]    [ch]Bbm[/ch]
You must be thinking[/tab]
of the wrong one


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
  I guess it was[/tab]
a lesson learned
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
  You're not the one[/tab]
I thought you were
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
  Blew up my life you[/tab]
weren't concerned
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]                 [ch]Bbm[/ch]
  In fact you just sat[/tab]
and watched me burn


[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
  Then ashed me[/tab]
like a cigarette
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
  Threw me away[/tab]
I can't forget
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
  So how dare you[/tab]
even try to say
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]             [ch]Bbm[/ch]
  That I'm the one[/tab]
that got away


[Chorus 2]
[tab]            [ch]Ab[/ch]
But I'm the one that[/tab]
you left high and dry
The one you loved
[tab]                [ch]Fm[/ch]
to make cry The one who[/tab]
let's be real you never
[tab]                [ch]Eb[/ch]
tried I was the promises[/tab]
you loved to break
The perfect plan
you never made
[tab]    [ch]Db[/ch]
Was all for none[/tab]
What's done is done
[tab]    [ch]Bbm[/ch]
You must be thinking[/tab]
of the wrong one

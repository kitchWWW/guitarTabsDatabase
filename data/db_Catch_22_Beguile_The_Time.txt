Verse I:
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
If I could stay mad enough maybe I'd leave [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
but you have to understand this runs twenty-two years deep. [/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Everyone wants it all. Everyone needs a place. [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
You can destroy or you can create. [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
All I know is all that I know [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
and I know we all just beguile the time. [/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]
But it all catches up and it's all so fucked up. [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
And only time will tell. [/tab]

Chorus:
[tab][ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
Oh, how it echoes. [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
Oh, when it echoes.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
It hits like a ton of feathers, when it echoes.[/tab]

Verse II:
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Common ground can't be found [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
from atop a hill looking down. Look around. [/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Take me to sleep. C'mon put me to weep. [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Can't you see that you've given your souls up for keeps? [/tab]

Bridge:

[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]

Take me to sleep. C'mon put me to weep. [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Can't you see that you've given your souls up for keeps? [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
And only time will tell.[/tab]

 We send in poor people to fight other poor people. [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]          
 We send in our brothers and sisters [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
and daughters and sons. There is no difference. [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
 We send in to kill [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
while we sit on our asses and watch green screens infotain all day long. [/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
It hits like a ton of feathers, when it echoes.[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I thought goodbyes were never easy[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
I should know by now, boy believe me[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
I thought love would just leave me broke[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
But I'm not, I can breathe, turns out you, set me free[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 1]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
And I'm wishing, I'm wishing, I'm wishing you find all that you need[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]B[/ch]
And I'm hoping you find somebody who loves you more than me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#m[/ch]
Yeah, it hurt me for like two weeks[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
Don't expect tears when you see me, noÂ€![/tab]


[Chorus 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
This ain't a holding on as long as we can 'cause this time there's no tears to dry[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
This is a "Thank You, God" we got out of the mess we were in baby just in time[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
Who knew there was still light in my eyes?[/tab]

Who knew that you don't have to try
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
And that you don't have to cry?[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]E[/ch]
Who knew there could be good goodbyes[/tab]

Hey eh eh, eh eh, hey eh eh, eh eh[/tab]

Hey eh eh, eh eh, hey eh eh, eh eh


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I might miss you if you'd have been there or[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Given me proof that you actually cared but now[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
There's no regrets, no turning back[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
Out of sight, out of mind[/tab]

Already left you behind


[Pre-Chorus 2]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
And I'm wishing, I'm wishing, I'm wishing you find somebody new[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
And I won't have no trouble finding someone who loves me more than you[/tab]

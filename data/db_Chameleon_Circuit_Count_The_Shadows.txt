[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                
The day is almost over and the sunlight is going[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
And the people walk through shadows completely unknowing[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Bb[/ch]                                                            [ch]F[/ch]
That there's something lethal in the air that they can't see.[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
Now a Time Lord could save me just by turning on a light[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Eb[/ch]
Although I don't think that the Doctor's gonna show up tonight[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bb[/ch]                                                             [ch]F[/ch]
So I'm trying to remember what the Library said to me.[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                                  [ch]Eb[/ch]
Gotta focus on all the silhouettes that you can see [/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]                                                          [ch]F[/ch]
'Cause if the number keeps on changing then you're no use to me.[/tab]

[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]
So count the shadows,[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Eb[/ch]
Count the shadows,[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]
Cause they're edging toward you[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]F[/ch]
Like a hungry moth to a flame[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]
Count the shadows,[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Eb[/ch]
Count the shadows,[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Bb[/ch]
Cause if you've got more than one [/tab]
[tab]                                                         [ch]F[/ch]
Then you're the victim that they will claim.[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
In the Library the darkness is waiting to attack,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
Some explorers went inside but they ain't never comin' back,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bb[/ch]                                                                  [ch]F[/ch]
Namely Miss Evangelista, Anita, and two guys called Dave.[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
And the shadows made four thousand other people disappear[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Eb[/ch]   
And they've been hungry and waiting for a whole damn year[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Bb[/ch]                                                           [ch]F[/ch]
For some fresh meat that isn't gonna register as saved.[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                                  [ch]Eb[/ch]
Gotta focus on all the silhouettes that you can see [/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]                                                          [ch]F[/ch]
'Cause if the number keeps on changing then you're no use to me.[/tab]


[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]

[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]      
Invisible carnivorous aggressive armada[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Eb[/ch]
And they go by the name of the Vashta Nerada,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                                                              [ch]F[/ch]
A thousand thousand million piranhas in the air.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch] 
And the tingle on your skin that you feel in the dark[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Eb[/ch]
Might be the hungry ones who contemplate leaving a mark[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Bb[/ch]                                                                     [ch]F[/ch]
So when you're reaching for the light switch make sure you're prepared.[/tab]

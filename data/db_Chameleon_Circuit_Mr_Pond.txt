[tab][ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
It's not the way she looks at you[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Dm[/ch]
Like you're the first man in her life[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]
cause I know Amy's true[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
And when we're through she'll be my wife[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
I know you save the universe[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Dm[/ch]
She paints you in perfect lights[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]
Though I may be just a nurse[/tab]

The Doctor isn't always right

[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
You've got no idea just how dangerous you make people to themselves[/tab]


[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
Cause I want to be Mr Pond[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
And I can't lie and say that I'm fond[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
Of the way you've been hurled into our world[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
Now that you've saved the day why don't you fly away[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Dm[/ch]
Cause I want to be Mr Pond[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]
But there's so many things that could go wrong[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]E7[/ch]
In your time machine that you just don't see[/tab]

Why can't she see

...

[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]
Why can't you see what you're doing to Amy[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
If you keep putting her in danger you're going to get her killed[/tab]

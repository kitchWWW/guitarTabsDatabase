I believe everything happens for a reason
Why did we end up here
Chronarchs dead, nothing left; all seems so confusing
Vortex can’t just disappear

What happens when all the lights go out
There’s no way back; we’re stranded now
What happens when everything goes dark
It’s got no life left in its heart

I’m sorry, I’m so sorry
Seems I’m not that clever after all

Now my race are erased; nothing but the memories
Folktalkes told through time
Legacy meant to be buried with the yale key
And my remaining lives

A green glimmer of hope, we can’t let it go to waste
If I give some of my life, we’ll use it to escape this place
Where are they running off to, I thought that they would care
Try to keep them safe, they don’t know what lies out there

I’m getting old and I can’t carry on

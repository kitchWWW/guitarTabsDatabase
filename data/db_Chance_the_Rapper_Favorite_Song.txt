Artist: Chance the Rapper
Song: Favorite Song
Genre: 
Key: 


The song pretty much repeats this same riff the entire time, it's sampled from an old soul song (betty wright 
I think, can't remember). The only hard part about it is the rhythm, it has kind of a triplet flow, so I put
some rhythm queues to try and help. Just listen to the song and you'll get it.

Timing:

Capital D and U is when you strike the strings, lowercase d and u you can either mute the strings with your 
left hand and strike them with your picking hand (to create a more percussive sound), or just move your hand 
corresponding to that to get your timing right for the chord strikes. I kind of do a combination of both. 
Again if this doesn't make sense just listen to the song, you can even play it with all down strokes if you 
want, but I'm pretty sure my way is better.

 1-----2-----3-----4-----5-----6-----7-----8-----  This just corresponds to quarter notes for reference
 D------U----------D------U----------D-----------
 --u-d-----d---u-----u-d-----d---u------u---d---u  I put the other strokes on a different line so it's 
                                                     easier to read

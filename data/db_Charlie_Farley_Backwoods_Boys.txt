[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]

[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
Once upon a time I was out flyin' down a line talkin'[/tab]

Hit the river at sixty-five, hit the bottom thought I died[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Come up and to my surprise I'm alive, alright[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                          [ch]C[/ch]
Livin' life to the fullest, never been much on a punk or bully[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
Helpin' others out any chance you can[/tab]

Karma, I'm afraid of that myself, 'cause my son acts just like his father[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                                          [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]Em7[/ch]
There is a version of this where we aren't hurting[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
Where I was a better person, you never wanted to leave[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]Em7[/ch]
There is a world where you call to tell me you still care[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
Life doesn’t have to be unfair, you’re coming home to me[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Em7[/ch]
You’re coming home to me[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
I think about you when we would get away[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]Em7[/ch]
Go up to Hotel June and forget for the day[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Laugh that Malibu is everything we're not[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]Em7[/ch]
We were getting so drunk that we didn’t even make it out the parking lot[/tab]


[Post-Chorus]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Ooh, ooh, I still miss you[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]Em7[/ch]
There was a moment, everything out in the open[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
We'd go up to the ocean, let our anger go[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]Em7[/ch]
Why didn't I tell you how badly I really need you?[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
You had better things to do, and I caught up too slow[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em7[/ch]
I caught up too slow[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
I think about you when we would get away[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]Em7[/ch]
Go up to Hotel June and forget for the day[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]

[Post-Chorus]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Em7[/ch]
Ooh, ooh, I still miss you[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]Em7[/ch]
These days all I ever do is miss you more[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]Em7[/ch]
Crying to my mother on the bedroom floor[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Em7[/ch]                 [ch]Bm7[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Em7[/ch]
Screaming to the ceiling that I lost the best thing that I ever had, mmm[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]Em7[/ch]
Go up to Hotel June and forget for the day (For the day)[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Laugh that Malibu is everything we're not[/tab]

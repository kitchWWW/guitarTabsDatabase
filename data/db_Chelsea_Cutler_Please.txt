[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]E[/ch]
You're still in the shower, don't know where you're gonna go.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F#m[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
I wish I had the power to make this house feel more like home.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]E[/ch]
I won't sleep a minute, leave the light on by the bed,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]
The bed you should be in, yeah, it's not how it's supposed to end.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
Please don't leave me here, I don't know where I started.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]

[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
I'll see you when I see you, it hurts you'll never know,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#m[/ch]                                   [ch]E[/ch]
'Cause maybe you'll come running when you're done being alone.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]
I swear I'll wait forever, if it means not letting go.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#m[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]
I'll put you under pressure; were you scared of getting close?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
Please don't leave me here, I don't know where I started.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]

All these bridges that we're burning, tables that we're turning,[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]F#m[/ch]
I won't let this go 'til I'm in the ground.[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
Promises you're breaking, parts of me you're taking,[/tab]

I don't know myself when you're not around.[/tab]

Please don't leave me here, I don't know where my heart is.

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]F7[/ch]
  She said, Tell me what it's all about[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F7[/ch]
I said, Why, why, why?[/tab]
[tab][ch]F7[/ch]
  It's just something you could do without[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F7[/ch]
You better try, try try[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Ab7[/ch]
She said,    I can't reach you on the telephone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab7[/ch]
   I can't call you when you're not at home[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb7[/ch]
You keep saying that you're all alone[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bb7[/ch]
That's a lie, lie, lie[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]               [ch]Bm7[/ch]
Bad advice had me down and undone[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em9[/ch]             [ch]Bm7[/ch]
Got to try again to be-lieve in myself[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm9[/ch]               [ch]Dm9[/ch]
Look at me, I'm a-lone in the end[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Gm7[/ch]                     [ch]D11[/ch]   [ch]C#11[/ch]  [ch]C11[/ch]
Can you see me falling, falling down?[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]F7[/ch]
  I said, Mama can you get it straight?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F7[/ch]
She said, Why, why, why?[/tab]
[tab][ch]F7[/ch]
  I wanna tell you that it just can't wait[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F7[/ch]
So let's try, try, try[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Ab7[/ch]
She said, I don't care where you might have gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab7[/ch]
I don't care because you've done me wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb7[/ch]
You been doing it far too long[/tab]

So goodbye, bye, bye

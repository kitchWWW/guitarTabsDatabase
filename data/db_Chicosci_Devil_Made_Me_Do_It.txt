[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
With her it felt like drowning[/tab]
The cheap wine we were drinking
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I just lied well I just lied[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I choke on the words said[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]Am[/ch]
To all the ones that I have loved since then[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
Three minutes sweet they passed me by goodnight[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
Push push now we die inside[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
The more I have you setting the walls on fire[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
The more I need you we collapse in time[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
This is how I'm killing myself[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
What were you thinking[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
This is a black memorial[/tab]
Listen hard she's calling for you
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]
I just lied well I just lied[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
There's nothing here worth saying[/tab]
Broken hearts cut and wearing thin
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
I just died inside her eyes goodbye[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Just when I thought I couldn't get enough[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
I'd give my life just to make it stop[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Stopwatch counting[/tab]
Her days expiring

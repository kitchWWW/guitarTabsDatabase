LYRICS
=============================================================================


VERSE:
Play me the empty space behind my eyes
They're yelling and screaming
But all I keep hearing is blah, blah, blah, blah

BRIDGE:
They're talking about the girls and boys making too much noise
And the problems to solve them but it doesn't involve them
I thought about this too much and it's clear that it's unclear
Unless you believe them, believe them and

PRE-CHORUS:
I won't do it, I won't do it, I won't do it

CHORUS:
It's alright it's a stereotype
And I don't mind if you use it
It's alright you can say what you like
Just don't mock the music

VERSE:
Blame me but you're nothing impressive at all
I'm happy to smile I'm happy to nod
If you're happy with making it up

BRIDGE:
They're talking about the girls and boys making too much noise
Through the playgrounds and backgrounds
And speeding through small towns
I thought about this today and it's strange
But it came to me as I was leaving believing

PRE-CHORUS
CHORUS

INTERLUDE II:
The ropes were all tangled
And the battle lines drawn
And I've marked off my space in the room you can't cross
I wanted to be different
But he's always been the same
And I can't, no I can't try and win this for you

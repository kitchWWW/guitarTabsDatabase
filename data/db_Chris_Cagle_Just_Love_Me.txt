Just Love Me Capo 4

[Intro] 
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]G/B[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G/B[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]                       
 I'll never be anybody's hero or the legend of a story[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
 Or a saint that's bound for glory, no[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                            
 And I'll never know what it's like to swim in money[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                                        
 Or how it feels not to have to go to work on Monday[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
 I'm a simple man, and that's okay[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
 But even a simple man wants to feel this way.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]Bm[/ch]
 Like the king of his castle, like the leader of the pack[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]A[/ch]
 Like a man that if you left him, you'd just have to have him back[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
 Like a rock that you would lean on when your world gets too rough[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
 Like a man that you would stand beside when he's not so tough.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
 But even if that's not the man you see[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G/B[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]               
 Then just love me, just love me.[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                               [ch]D[/ch]
 I'll never write a song that lasts forever or a book for all the ages[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
 But I'm not full of empty pages, no[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               
 'Cause I got a soul, and I use it for yearnin'[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                                            
 With a heart that skips a beat for you and a fire that keeps on burnin'[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
 I'm a simple man, and that's okay[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
 But even a simple man wants to feel this way.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]Bm[/ch]
 Like the king of his castle, like the leader of the pack[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]A[/ch]
 Like a man that if you left him, you'd just have to have him back[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
 Like a rock that you would lean on when your world gets too rough[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
 Like a man that you would stand beside when he's not so tough.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
 But even if that's not the man you see[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G/B[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]               
 Then just love me, [/tab]

[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
 Oh, I'm a simple man, and that's okay[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
 But even a simple man wants to be swept away, and feel[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]Bm[/ch]
 Like the king of his castle, like the leader of the pack[/tab]

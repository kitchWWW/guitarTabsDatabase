[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
I used to run a round[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
I used to burn it down[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
Always been a redneck renegade son of a gun[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Around this town[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I used to break the law[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
Any given day[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
It took some time to change[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
My outlaw ways[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
It took a wife[/tab]
It took a kid
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
To quit doing things like I'd always did[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
Things I'd always done[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah they were fun[/tab]
That was me
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
But that was then[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Sleepless nights and Jesus Christ[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
N' gettin' called once or twice[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
You bend and bend and bend[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
And then you break[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
And then you change[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Them outlaw ways[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
I didn't know what love was[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Not until I met her[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
She is like a good drug[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
She keeps me fellin' better[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
And I used to be a sinner[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Bm[/ch]
And I'm still a sinner to day[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
That's the most natural part of[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
My outlaw ways[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
It took a wife[/tab]
It took a kid
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
To quit doing things like I'd always did[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
Things I'd always done[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah they were fun[/tab]
That was me
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
But that was then[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Sleepless nights and Jesus Christ[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
N' gettin' called once or twice[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
You bend and bend and bend[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
And then you break[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
And then you change[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Them outlaw ways[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
And then you change[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]
Ohh, and then I changed[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Them outlaw ways[/tab]

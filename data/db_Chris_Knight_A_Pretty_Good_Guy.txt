A Pretty Good Guy

                                                            
[Verse 1]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
There's a couple old people live across the road[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]Bb/G[/ch]
So I keep the volume down on my radio[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
And all the neighbors say when I go by[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
He's a pretty good guy[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
I'm cerified in CPR[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]Bb/G[/ch]
And if you asked me to I'd fix your car[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch] 
It's just the way I am[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
I got a pretty good life[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]   
I'm a pretty good guy[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Just one good man[/tab]

All the good ones are gone
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
Hey play it again[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I like that song[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                                   
There's a pretty good guy[/tab]
                                                                                                         
Walking up the street
          ะก                                                  
And you'd be surprised
[tab]                        [ch]Bb/G[/ch]                                     
He looks a lot like me [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]                                 
Since you've been gone I've realized[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]Bb/G[/ch]                                         
That you were wrong [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                                                      
I'm a pretty good guy[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Bb/G[/ch]                                      
And it didn't take long[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                                                      
I'm a pretty good guy[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                      [ch]D[/ch]
In the southern part of Texas, east and west of El Paso[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                                  [ch]Em[/ch]
Where the mighty Franklin Mountains guard the trail to Mexico[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
Theres a new made widow cryin' and a hearse a-rollin slow[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]

[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
Theres a lathered sorrel stallion runnin through the Joshua Trees[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
A young man in the saddle with his coat tails in the breeze[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
Got a six gun on his right hip and a rifle at his knee[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
And he's dealin' in a game that he can't win[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Poor Billy Bonney, you're only twenty-one[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
Pat Garrett's got your name on every bullet in his gun[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
Each notch you carved on your six-gun's got a bloody tale to tell[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Bm[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
Well, you're a mile ahead of Garrett and a step outside of hell[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
Them fancy clothes you're wearin' and the women in your bed[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]
Can't take away the faces of the men that you left dead[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
As you ride across the badlands with a price upon your head[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Now that wheel of fortune starts to turn[/tab]


[Verse 4]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
Your reputation's grown 'til its the biggest in the land[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
And there ain't a lot of people left who wanna call your hand[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
And I guess you'll go down shootin' just like all branded men[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]
And when you shake hands with the Devil you get burned[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]A[/ch]
You've finally arrived at the goals that you set[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]                                          [ch]A[/ch]
You thought that was it boy but you can't quit yet[/tab]

There's a lonesome old road and it starts at the top[/tab]

The prize that you gained it's a crown you can't keep[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A7[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
When you finally won at vanity's game[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Is the title you hold worth the price you paid[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                          [ch]A[/ch]
You wrote your own song and you lived your own life[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                                               [ch]A[/ch]
But something went wrong cause the feelin' ain't right[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A7[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
Oh you've got it all but the magic's all gone[/tab]

You're at the top of the world boy but your standing alone[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]A7[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
You know freedom ain't free and glory ain't cheap[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
The prize that you gained it's a crown you can't keep[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A7[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
When you finally won at vanity's game[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]

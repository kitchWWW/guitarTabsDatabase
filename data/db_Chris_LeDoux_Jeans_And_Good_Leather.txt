[Verse]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]
White shirts and neckties the way that my check flies[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Are part of what's wrong with my soul[/tab]
[tab]                                                                       [ch]C[/ch]
Risin' expenses and all kinds of fences keep me from where I'd like to go[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]
Work complications and stiff conversations they sometimes drive me up the wall[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
Make me want to holler to hell with this collar walk out and just chunk it all[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                                            [ch]C[/ch]
What I need is denims and a place to get in 'em and walk over Gods open land[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
And boots of good leather I'd wander wherever[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D7[/ch]                     [ch]G7[/ch]
I found the beauty from his mighty hands[/tab]
[tab]                                                                           [ch]F[/ch]
Lots of wide open spaces and quite simple places tells me it's pack up and go time[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                                             [ch]C[/ch]
Cause in jeans and good leather son I could be better in no time[/tab]

[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
I gaze in the mirror and press my face nearer to check out the lines one by one[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Round eyes that were brighter on cheeks growin' lighter[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
That were once so brown from the sun[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
As I spend starin' I find myself darein' the image that's looking at me[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
To throw off the fetter and seek somethin' better a life that's simple and free[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                                            [ch]C[/ch]
What I need is denims and a place to get in 'em and walk over Gods open land[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
And boots of good leather I'd wander wherever[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D7[/ch]                     [ch]G7[/ch]
I found the beauty from his mighty hands[/tab]

Lots of wide open spaces and quite simple places tells me it's pack up and go time[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                                             [ch]C[/ch]

[ch]E[/ch]  [ch]A2[/ch]  [ch]D2[/ch]  [ch]Cadd9[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]


[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A2[/ch]
You think I'd have it down by now[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D2[/ch]    [ch]Cadd9[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]   
Been practicin' for thirty years[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]A2[/ch]
I should have walked a thousand miles[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D2[/ch]       [ch]Cadd9[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]
So what am I still doin' here[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A2[/ch]                                             [ch]E[/ch]
Reachin' out for that same old piece of forbidden fruit[/tab]
[tab]                                          [ch]A2[/ch]
I slip and fall and I knock my halo loose[/tab]
[tab]                                              [ch]B[/ch]
Somebody tell me what's a boy supposed to do?[/tab]


Chorus
[tab]                  [ch]E[/ch]
Cause I get so clumsy[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]B[/ch]
I get so foolish[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#m[/ch]
I get so stupid[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]
And then I feel so useless[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]E[/ch]
But you're sayin' You love me[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]B[/ch]
And you're still gonna hold me[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C#m[/ch]
And that You wanna be near me[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]
'Cause You're makin' me holy[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D2[/ch]  [ch]Cadd9[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]
You're still makin' me holy,        yeah[/tab]



I'm gonna get it right this time
I'll be strong and I'll make You proud
I've prayed that prayer a thousand times
But the rooster crows and my tears roll down (again)
Then You remind me You made me from the dust
And I can never, no never, be good enough
And that You're not gonna let that come between us


Chorus
[tab][ch]C2[/ch]
   From where I stand[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D2[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]
Your holiness is up so high I can never reach it[/tab]
[tab][ch]C2[/ch]                             [ch]D2[/ch]
   My only hope is to fall on Jesus[/tab]

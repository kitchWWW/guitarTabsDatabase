[Intro] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]

[Vers]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]
She was a sinner like all other guardians[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]
For of her daughter she was proud[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
Went to the market on the third Sunday again[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]
And there she vanished in the crowd[/tab]

[Chorus] Fig 2
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
Oh it wasn’t long ago you suckled to her breast[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
And how your eyes exploded as you took your first breath[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
Now the lading days return and the want beckons the yearn[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
To rise above the nest and to lay your head to rest[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
Forlorn but for the best[/tab]

[Interlude] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]

[Vers]
Immigrants come and emigrants go
Tell me why is it like that?
Emigrant at heart and an immigrant in mind
Ones’ emaciation an others’ fat

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
Oh it wasn’t long ago you suckled to her breast[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
And how your eyes exploded as you took your first breath[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
Now the lading days return and the want beckons the yearn[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
To rise above the nest and to lay your head to rest[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
Forlorn but for the best[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Crying emigrant at heart and an immigrant in mind[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]Em[/ch]
Touching all the trees to see if there was one with bark like mine[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bm[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
In denial we worried that this was never meant[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
And on trial in the wake of all the prayers we never sent[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
Oh it wasn’t long ago you suckled to her breast[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
And how your eyes exploded as you took your first breath[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
Now the lading days return and the want beckons the yearn[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
To rise above the nest and to lay your head to rest[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
Forlorn but for the best[/tab]

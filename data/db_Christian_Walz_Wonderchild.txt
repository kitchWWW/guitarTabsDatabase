Verse 2: (same as verse 1)

I get to you at the speed of sound,
Really fast when you're on the run,
Cause the world's closing in on us,
A second later we on the bus,
You're so fine and i love u so
So beautiful but I have to know, is it real or is it just a game?!
Take a ride, won't come back the same,

Chorus:

How you gonna run at the speed of sound?
Ooh, ooh wonderchild,
How you gonna breathe if you're underground?
How many times will you try?
How you gonna walk at the rainbow's edge?
Ooh, ooh wonderchild,
Oooh wonderchild,
Every thing comes to an end,

[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]
    And if I could be with you,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G#m[/ch]
I keep on wonder why,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]
If this whole escapade[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G#m[/ch]
Is it worth all this time?[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
And if I could be with you,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G#m[/ch]
I keep on wonder why,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]
If this whole escapade,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G#m[/ch] 
Is it worth all[/tab]


Chorus:

How you gonna run at the speed of sound?

Oooh wonderchild,
Every thing comes to an end.

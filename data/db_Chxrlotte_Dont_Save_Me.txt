[Intro]

[tab][ch]G5[/ch] [ch]G5[/ch]
   Ooh oh oh oh oh oh[/tab]
[ch]Gm[/ch]

[Verse]

[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
I came from the darkness hiding on my own[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Like rain thoughts are harmless, leave me here alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
The waking nightmares aren't as bad as dreaming I suppose[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
But it's pulling me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Under the lightning and thunder ignite a wilted rose[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Maybe I'm wretched and deserve this, I don't know[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Don't save me, I'm almost glad if this is how I go[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
The monsters under my bed want to beat me to it though[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Every word that they've said[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
It goes 'round in my head while I drown in the undertow[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]

[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Look into my eyes[/tab]
And tell me what you see
A demon in disguise
Pretending to be me
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Bury your surprise[/tab]
And listen carefully
He lives inside my mind
He'll never let me free

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
The wasteland never ends and it's killing me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Wait and count to ten but[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
I'll never be able to live I can't seem to breathe[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
I'll die fading carefully so don't save me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
Standing on the edge, it's darker now[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
And it's in my head, I can't hear a sound[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Facing the storm I'm cast out at sea[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
I'll drown eventually so don't save me[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Gm[/ch]
I think these walls can talk, they tell me I'm insane[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
I can't live anymore and I'm the one to blame[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
At night my thoughts they scare me I can't face another day[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Every thought leaves it's mark I'm not scared of the dark[/tab]
N.C.
I'm afraid when the sky turns grey

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
The wasteland never ends and it's killing me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Wait and count to ten but[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
I'll never be able to live I can't seem to breathe[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
I'll die fading carefully so don't save me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
Standing on the edge, it's darker now[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
And it's in my head, I can't hear a sound[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Facing the storm I'm cast out at sea[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
I'll drown eventually so don't save me[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]           [ch]C5[/ch]    [ch]G5[/ch]
Don't save me I think I'm in hell[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C5[/ch]    [ch]G5[/ch]
These walls are talking I can tell[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C5[/ch]    [ch]G5[/ch]
I've bathed in fire since I fell[/tab]
Don't leave me on my own

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
The wasteland never ends and it's killing me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Wait and count to ten but[/tab]

I'll never be able to live I can't seem to breathe[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]

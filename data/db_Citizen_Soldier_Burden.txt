[Verse 1]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
I think you say sorry too much[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
I think you got issues with trust[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
From the voices in your head that say that you're too hard to love[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
I think you still live with the ghosts of people you needed the most[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
That let you down and taught you how to keep your closet door closed[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
But I've been there and I would rather die[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
Than watch you drown in tears that you need to cry[/tab]

[Chorus 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You can talk, you can talk to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I can tell that you're not okay[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
You can spill your guts, I won't leave[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]C[/ch]
You are not a burden to me[/tab]

You can talk, you can talk to me
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Even down in your darkest place[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
You can let your skeletons scream[/tab]

You are not a burden to me

[Verse 2]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]
I think that you never get heard[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
For thinkin' someone's got it worse[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
Been minimized so many times that you believe it's deserved[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
I think you've been silent since youth[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Because every time you speak your truth[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
You're stigmatized, re-traumatiuzed[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
By all the things you didn't choose[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I don't mind your darker side, you can lose control[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
I'd rather heal your hell than see your funeral[/tab]

[Chorus 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You can talk, you can talk to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I can tell that you're not okay[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
You can spill your guts, I won't leave[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]C[/ch]
You are not a burden to me[/tab]

You can talk, you can talk to me
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Even down in your darkest place[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
You can let your skeletons scream[/tab]

You are not a burden to me

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
The monsters that you're holding back[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
There's no need to dress them up[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
The ugly thruth gave depth to you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Now there's so much more to love[/tab]

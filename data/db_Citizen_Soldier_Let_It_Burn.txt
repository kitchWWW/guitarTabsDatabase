Maybe you're broken, maybe you're shattered[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
With no reasons left to try[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
But you still have so much, so much worth saving[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
That you have left on the inside[/tab]


[Pre Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
I know you feel like you are worthless, and that your day has come[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
The misery eats you alive until you come undone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]
You feel like there is nowhere left to call your home tonight[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You are not alone, this is our time, and I am by your side[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
My friend this is do or die![/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]
Hey kid can you hear me?[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]F[/ch]
Don't you dare pull the trigger and throw it all away[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
You have every reason left to stay alive[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
All this hell you've lived and seen[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
Drown it all in gasoline[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
And light a match, pull the pin[/tab]

You are not, who you've been
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
The past is just lessons learned[/tab]

So light it up, and let it burn

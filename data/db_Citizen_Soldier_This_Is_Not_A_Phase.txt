[Verse 1]
[tab]       [ch]D5[/ch]
If you wanna know why I've been losing sleep[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A5[/ch]
Look in the mirror the same way you look at me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]B5[/ch]                                [ch]G5[/ch]
Every time I spill my guts and you don't believe[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A5[/ch]
Am I dramatic or dying? I guess we'll see[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D5[/ch]
This is not a phase (No)[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A5[/ch]
I can't remember the last time I felt okay[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]B5[/ch]
So if you think that it's so easy being me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A5[/ch]                           [ch]G5[/ch]
Live in my head for a day and you'll see, no[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]       [ch]D5[/ch]
If you wanna know why I always hide what hurts[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A5[/ch]
Listen to what you say when I'm at my worst[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B5[/ch]                                        [ch]G5[/ch]
Every word is proof you're the one that's cursed (Hmm)[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A5[/ch]
Will they kill me before you can ever learn?[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D5[/ch]
This is not a phase (No)[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A5[/ch]

[tab][ch]G5[/ch]                            [ch]E5[/ch]
 It's not a trend, it's not a trick[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]B5[/ch]
I'm not dramatic, I'm just sick[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A5[/ch]
I'm so afraid it's come to this[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]G5[/ch]
A chance to save my life you'll miss[/tab]

Life's not what you take[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]F#[/ch]
 It's not about the promises you make[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
It's not about the friends you might have made[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F#[/ch]
Or love that is gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
 Life is what you give[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]F#[/ch]
 It's not about the stupid things you did[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
 It's not about the way things could've been[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]F#[/ch]
 It's about movin' on[/tab]

[Chorus:]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
 It's all about you[/tab]

 So every morning when wake, before the first step that you take[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
 Just think it's all what you make it[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F#[/ch]
 And you'll make it through[/tab]

[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]                                       [ch]F#[/ch]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]F#[/ch]

 Will kill themselves or somebody else's, life they really couldnt manage.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
 Then we got bums, alcoholics on the streets[/tab]

 With no stress, nowhere to rest, nowhere to dress, nowhere to sleep.[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em7[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
 And they say 'fuck my morals, I'm drinkin' away my sorrow[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                        [ch]F#[/ch]

 This here is life so tell me who choses whats wrong and right.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                         [ch]F#[/ch]
 Is it what we see on tv? Get a job, raise a family.[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
 That's how I was raised, how I was brought up[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
 Get a wife, a son and daughter.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
 That's how I was taught to be proper.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F#[/ch]
 Never thought anyone could get caught up.[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em7[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
 And slowly I grew up and the fairytale quickly vanished.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bm[/ch]                                      [ch]F#[/ch]
 Realized that life is a bitch, and shit, you gotta be able to stand it.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
 And you gotta be able to handle it, this stress and the pressure, you channel it..[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                                               [ch]F#[/ch]
 And you learn to cope, at the end of your rope anyway that you can with liqor or dope.[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em7[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
 Or work hard, raise your kids. Strip clubs, whatever it is.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bm[/ch]                         [ch]F#[/ch]
 Smoke weed, shoot hoops, whatever you find your happiness through.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                                            [ch]D[/ch]
 It's your life. Just make sure you know what you want when you go out and get it[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]F#[/ch]
 Keep doing this shit for you, not your crew, or the dude you're tryna impress, kid.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em7[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
 Life is simple, life is hard and yeah life is fun[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bm[/ch]                             [ch]F#[/ch]
 So enjoy the things around you before your life is done.[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Picture this, you and me in the morning[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Kissing over the coffee you're pouring[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
It could be like that every day[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Hate it that I wish you were -[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Hoping that I'm a better replacement[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
For the guys that you're always out chasing[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Or should I accept things I can't change?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Hate it that I wish you were -[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
I wish you were gay so you could just hold me[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
Call me your babe instead of your homie[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]
Don't know what to say[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Gm[/ch]
But I wish you were gay[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
I wish you were gay so it would be easy[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
For me to say that I'm catching feelings[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]
And I know you're straight[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Gm[/ch]
But I wish you were gay[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Now I see you get off of the subway[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Haven't seen you in months but it's okay[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'd forgotten but I feel the same[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Hate that I still wish you were -[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You walk up and I'm dreading the small talk[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
With your boyfriend, he's chatting my ear off[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
So I lie and I say I can't stay[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Hate that I still wish you were -[/tab]


[Chorus]

Call me your babe instead of your homie[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]
Don't know what to say[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
We'd be so good[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
Give me one look[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]

The dreams that I'm having are just getting worse[/tab]

She said a "hey plow boy done ate half a cow[/tab]
And I still can hear your big old belly growl
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
So I steamed up a fresh heap of broccoli for you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
You've got calories to burn and some pounds to lose"[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
Well you can bring that broccoli with squirrel and dumplings[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin' for nuthin'[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
She said "I've cooked non-stop in this house for weeks[/tab]
Time to get your big butt up on somewhere's else to eat"
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
So I've been down to Shoney's four times today[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
I hit the Sizzler and the Quincy's they were on the way[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
I 'bout blowed out my colon from buffet jumpin'[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Cause Cledus don't stop a-eatin' for nuthin'[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
If you like love handles and big old buns[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
I've pounds of passion and tons of fun[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I look like Flabio in my king-cab truck[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
To look like Brooks and Dunn I need a tummy tuck[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
We got to find a little place where I can eat some more[/tab]
Before I start rollin' on this hardwood floor
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Head down to Hooters break out the wings[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
Then make a run down to the border I'm an eatin' machine[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Fire up the stove and keep the fat clams comin'[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin for nuthin'[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
If it's all you can eat then you'll see me runnin'[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin for nuthin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Tell Richard Simmons he can kiss my bumpkin[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Cause Cledus don't stop eatin for nuthin'[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
Make my pies pumpkin[/tab]
And my donuts Dunkin
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Cause Cledus don't (No Chord) stop.[/tab]

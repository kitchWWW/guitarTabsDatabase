[Chorus]

[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
 He's Cadillac Jack Favor and the name rings true,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C7[/ch]
     if he's got a ride any stranger would, too,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
    the one bad habit that his Ponder would say[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
     is sure gonna put him through the trials one day.[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
     And that's just what happened, he took pity on two men,[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C7[/ch]
     heading down to Louisiana, he stopped and let them in,[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
     and the thanks he did for helping them[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                                                            [ch]G[/ch]
     would make him wish he was busting broncs again.[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]C[/ch]                                                [ch]G[/ch]
    He dropped them off in Bossieer City where they met up with a man,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                                          [ch]D[/ch]
    that vagabond commitee barely even had a plan.[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                                                           [ch]C[/ch]
    It was just a simple robbery turned double homicide,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                                            [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
    they got away with murder, it'd be someone else's hide.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
    Almost two years come and gone, they never solved that crime,[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C7[/ch]
     'til they found one of our vagabonds already doing time,[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
 when that jailbird started singing, they all knew the words were wrong,[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
     but the sheriff and the DA and the judge all sang along.[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
    They pinned it on Jack Favor, gave him life without parole[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C7[/ch]
    gave Jack's freedom to the jailbird, payment on the lies he told,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                                         [ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch]
   just so happens that election year everybody paid out at the polls.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C7[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]
    Cadillac's no fallen hero, and he's never gonna break,[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]                                              [ch]D[/ch]
    when it comes to prison rodeo, there'll be no easy eight.[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]                                                             [ch]C[/ch]
    And if you want the definition of the picture-perfect frame,[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
    it'd be in the dictionary underneath Jack Favor's name.[/tab]

[Solo]
 [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] 

[Outro]
[tab]            [ch]C7[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]
    Cadillac's no fallen hero, and he's never gonna break,[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]                                               [ch]D[/ch]
    when it comes to prison rodeo, there's still no easy eight.[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]                                                             [ch]C[/ch]
    And if you want the definition of the picture-perfect frame,[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
    it'd be in the dictionary underneath Jack Favor's name.[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]
    Yeah, it's the world's most crooked picture,[/tab]
[tab]                                                   [ch]C[/ch]
    and when it comes to being framed,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                                           [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
    Cadillac Jack Favor should be in the hall of fame.[/tab]

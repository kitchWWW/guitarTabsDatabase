[Verse 1]
[ch]G[/ch]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
Blue Kentucky highway, headin' for the line[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
She hadn't said a word all night, but the wheels are turning in her mind[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
Now I was ridin' shotgun, and I knew things were going right[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Just as soon as she dropped me off at the side of the road[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
And she let that gravel fly[/tab]

[Chorus]
[ch]D[/ch]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Now I'm walking in the moonlight[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Seein' nothin' but the taillights[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
That's a pair of taillights[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
I may never see again[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
She hit me with a left and right[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
That's about as lonely as a highway has ever been[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Back here with my thumb out in the wind[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[ch]G[/ch]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Was it something that I did to her, or the things I never said[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
I wonder if the way we were was only in my head[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
Now if I even make it back alive before the sun comes up[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
I'm gonna hit every parking spot around[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
'Till I find that pickup truck[/tab]

[Chorus]
[ch]D[/ch]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Now I'm walking in the moonlight[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Seein' nothin' but the taillights[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
That's a pair of taillights[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
I may never see again[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
She hit me with a left and right[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
That's about as lonely as a highway has ever been[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Back here with my thumb out in the wind[/tab]

[Bridge]
[ch]G[/ch]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Well I'll bet right now she's laughin' at how[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
She brought me to my knees[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
But she won't be laughin' half as loud when she gives me back my keys[/tab]

[Chorus]
[ch]D[/ch]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Now I'm walking in the moonlight[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Seein' nothin' but the taillights[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
That's a pair of taillights[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
I may never see again[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
She hit me with a left and right[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
That's about as lonely as a highway has ever been[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Back here with my thumb out in the wind[/tab]

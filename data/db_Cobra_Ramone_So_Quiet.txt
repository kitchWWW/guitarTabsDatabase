[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Took your car to the river, it was midnight[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Moon so bright that we didn't need the headlights[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I got out, left my clothing on the hood[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                              [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
You were so still, couldn't see, couldn't see where you stood[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]
And it was quiet, it was so quiet[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
   It was quiet, it was so quiet[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]
It was so quiet[/tab]

Water cold but it couldn't stop the fires[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                                 [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]
Helicopters over head keeping rhythm with the choirs[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
20 thousand abandoned their homes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                                              [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
They were gathered at the church 'cause there's nowhere left to go[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]
And it was quiet, it was so quiet[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]Bm[/ch]
  It was quiet, it was so quiet[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
It was so quiet[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
All the while you were holding my hand[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]                                         [ch]F[/ch]
You were looking in my eyes like you knew I'd understand[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                        [ch]E[/ch]
The water in my lungs brings the safety like the drugs[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]
Like the drugs[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                                      [ch]G[/ch]
There's water underneath just about every bridge I ever set my feet on[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                                                                  [ch]G[/ch]
So, I'd like to give the benefit of a doubt to those that just can't get a read on[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, 'cause when I think I'm doing pretty good[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
There's always something else[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Oh, 'cause every time I think I've learned all that I need about the world[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
I'll learn a little more[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                                                [ch]G[/ch]
I've never listened too much, but so many times, I've wished I hadn't spoken[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                                                           [ch]G[/ch]
If I could see through anger, would I discover people that are broken, or hurting?[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, I think that that would change my whole view[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And probably change yours, too[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Oh, 'cause every time I think I've learned all that I need about the world[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
I'll learn a little more[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, and all the talking heads on TV[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
And writers with our blogs[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Maybe instead of speculating on what we really know nothing about[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
Those words are helping no one out[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Let's all learn a little more[/tab]

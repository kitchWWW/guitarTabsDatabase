Intro: [ch]D[/ch] – [ch]A[/ch] – [ch]D[/ch] – [ch]A[/ch] – [ch]E[/ch] – [ch]A[/ch] 


Verse 1:

[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
All I did was drink all day in that hell they call L.A.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]
A southern born man wants a gun in his hand[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
When he sees how they run that place [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Never say I'm better than anyone [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Cause Lord knows that I'm not [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
But that California summer     wasn't that hot[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
We went out there searchin for something [/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
Instead we all got lost [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
We were headin out west And the plans were goin south [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Never counted no cost[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
By the time I hit Arizona I was on my way to sea[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
65 Days in L.A. is enough for me[/tab]


Chorus:

[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
And I would drink 'till the sun came up[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
And I was tryin to find myself[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                                     [ch]E[/ch]
But it's hard to find yourself in a state like that[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
I was born a runnin man and anywhere I'm free[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
But 65 days in L.A. is enough for me[/tab]

Verse 2:

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Been a few good folks out there any and every where [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
We were runnin' down the same things all about insane[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Thinkin we'd find them out there[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Steppin' over bums on the sidewalk [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
To get back to my front door[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
And by the middle of August    couldn't take anymore[/tab]


Chorus 2:

[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]
So I loaded up what little I had left [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
And I bought two packs of smokes[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                                         [ch]E[/ch] 
I was haulin back to my girl     all back to my own[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
I was born a runnin man and anywhere I'm free[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
But 65 days in L.A. is enough for me[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
65 days anywhere is too much for me[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
Too much for me [/tab]

Genre: 
Key: Am


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch] 
It’s a long, hard, and a windin’ road to where I am right now[/tab]

A lot of days I wish I could change, but I can’t figure how

‘Cause all them places I’ve been, the things that I’ve seen
[tab][ch]G[/ch] 
I’d be better off dead than goin’ there again[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch] 
And I’ve been caught somewhere in between[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
A memory and a dream[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Well, I’ve been screamin’ at the world[/tab]

Since the time that I could talk

Well, I’ve been runnin’ into walls

Since the day that I could walk

‘Cause all them bottles I’ve drank, never mind the smoke
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Man, the years are gangin’ up on me, but I’m a holdin’ onto hope[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
And I’m still caught somewhere in between[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]
A memory and a dream[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah, ten years gone, I’ve been around the world[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
And somehow, I always wind up here[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
It must be this company I keep, oh that takes me back[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
And gets me on my feet[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, my life is still exactly what it seems[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]
A memory and a dream[/tab]

[Instrumental]

[Chorus][/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah, ten years gone, I’ve been around the world[/tab]

[Reprise]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
It’s a long, hard, and a windin’ road[/tab]

From where I am right now

A lot of days I wish I could change

but I can’t figure how

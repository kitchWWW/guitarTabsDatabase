[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I've played every honky tonk and roadside bar and juke joint[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                                               [ch]C[/ch]
Between here and Minneapolis, you know I've lived these miles[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]G[/ch]
There's a haggard man behind these eyes and smile[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I picked up the guitar 'round the time I turned fourteen[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                        [ch]G7[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Lit that fire, been burnin' tires, hard booze both hands in gasoline, stayin' wired[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Come back down the best that we know how, we know now[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
We're all tryin' to quit smoking, tired of laughin', tired of joking[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
'Bout the habits we all have, slowly creepin' up[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
We all gotta die from somethin', livin' kills you, life is tough[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
But I can't quit, 'cause I can't quit enough[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I've felt all the pressures playing to an empty room[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]G7[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
The pleasures of the crowd that's singin' loud to every word to all my songs[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
But the band and me, Lord, keep rollin' on, we roll on[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
We're still tryin' to quit smoking, tired of laughin', tired of joking[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
'Bout the habits we all have, slowly creepin' up[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
We all gotta die from somethin', livin' kills you, life is tough[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
But I can't quit, 'cause I can't quit enough[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
No I'll never quit 'cause I can't quit enough[/tab]

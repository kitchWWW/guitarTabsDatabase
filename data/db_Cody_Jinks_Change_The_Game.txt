As recorded by Cody Jinks

[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I've been up and down these highways[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
Put up wet and rode too hard[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
Worked to death to earn respect and I've earned every single scar[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
I always thought that this was crazy[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
Didn't know it'd go this far[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch] N.C.
But here I am[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
These wheels, they keep on turning[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
Headed right into the stars[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]
I know it's all been worth it[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Man, I sure miss playing bars[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
All I ever really wanted was to sing and play guitar[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
With my friends[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
Some said I'd never make it[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
That I didn't do things right[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
So I showed them who I was[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
And then I made it just despite[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
I changed the game, stood in the rain, I may be borderline insane[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
Been messed around, I've been put down but I keep coming back again[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
I wear that hat, yeah, I'm the punk that says I did it my own way[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
And at the end of the day I can say[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
I changed the game[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
So I keep moving, looking forward to what I have yet to find[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
I keep searching for a song and I keep humming on a rhyme[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]A[/ch]
I keep praying for the young bloods next in line to take my place[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
And the next one to stand up and say[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
Some said I'd never make it[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
That I didn't do things right[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
So I showed them who I was[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
And then I made it just despite[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
I changed the game, stood in the rain, I may be borderline insane[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
Been messed around, I've been put down but I keep coming back again[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]

[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
And at the end of the day I can say[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
At the end of the day I can say[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
I changed the game[/tab]

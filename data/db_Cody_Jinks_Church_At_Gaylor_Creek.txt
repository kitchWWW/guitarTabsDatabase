[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
My favorite memories are some of my first[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]E[/ch]
Like a Sunday night meetin' at an old[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
country church[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]D[/ch]
Sometimes my grandparents, they would come[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
and take me[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]E[/ch]
To an old country church house on Gaylor[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Creek[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
We all knew our neighbors, everyone there[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
was friends[/tab]

And the preacher worked the timber like
[tab][ch]E[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
all of the men[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
We were baptized in water, we were washed in[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
the blood[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]E[/ch]
Don't remember much money but I recall lots[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]A7[/ch]
of love[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
That church was a long time ago, yeah I'm[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
talkin' distance and years[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I'm not for certain that I could even get[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]A7[/ch]
there from here[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
But on nights when I'm sober, not blinded by[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
all that I see[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]
My mind washes up at that church on Gaylor[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Creek[/tab]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
So many barrooms, so many strangers[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]A7[/ch]
Women and whiskey, so many dangers[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
That old honky tonk highway, that's a wild[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
horse to rope[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Son, I've seen enough neon to circle the[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]      [ch]A7[/ch]
globe[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
That church was a long time ago, yeah I'm[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
talkin' distance and years[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I'm not for certain that I could even get[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]A7[/ch]
there from here[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
But on nights when I'm sober, not blinded by[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
all that I see[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]
My mind washes up at that church on Gaylor[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]

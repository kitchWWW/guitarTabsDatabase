Artist: Cody Jinks
Song: Colorado
Genre: 
Key: D


Colorado by Cody Jinks from the album Lifers (2018).
Written by Cody Jinks and Ward Davis.
*If you like Jinks and haven't heard of Davis, check him out, you won't be disappointed.*

Song is played tuned in Eb standard tuning, as are most of his songs. I kept the tuning on here as 'Standard'
to keep the chord shapes accurate. Let me know if there are any errors.

[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
On an aspen by the cabin where we stayed[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                             [ch]Bm[/ch]
Sometimes in the summer, it'll lightnin', it'll thunder[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]Bm[/ch]
But the rain don't seem to come it rolls on by[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                   [ch]Bm[/ch]
Thunder sounds like laughter, as the lightning hits the pasture[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
and you know that has lands been dry for some time[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
And it burns and it burns, oh it burns[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
The river it stopped flowin' back through town some time ago[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]Bm[/ch]
and the train tracks rest below a bed of weeds[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                                                                [ch]A[/ch]
The truck stop shut its door on the day that oil hit a hundred and four dollars a barrel[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
Yall then the grocery store came next and then the bank[/tab]


[Pre-chorus]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
And it burns oh it burns, it burns[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
Oh it burns, yeah it burns, oh it burns[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
You do the things you know to just to make it by the day[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
You can hear the kids a cryin', but there's just no time to play[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
You work the way you know how just the way you've always done[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
and you'd like to curse the skies that bring no rain or block the sun[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]
And it burns[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
Sometimes when it's rainin' and there seems there ain't no stoppin'[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]Bm[/ch]
and a storm surge rushes past and all goes down[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch]
That river roars with laughter as it strips away the pasture land[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
the home you built and worked with your own hands[/tab]


[Pre-chorus]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
And it rains, oh it rains, yeah it rains[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
And it rains, oh it rains, yeah it rains[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
You do the things you know to just to make it by the day[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]

and you'd like to curse the skies that bring the rain and block the sun[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]
And it rains[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                             [ch]Bm[/ch]

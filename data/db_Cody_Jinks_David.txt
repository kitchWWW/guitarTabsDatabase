[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
My friend David was a good kid[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
He had my back I always knew he did[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]            
And he was different than most, and maybe I was too[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
And hanging out with the in crowd just wasn't our thang[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
There was a whole lot more than we could see on these plains[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
Well some people just seem to get stuck, and hang around[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
It's college or trade school for those with the means[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
There's never been any small town dreams for those in between [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Yeah the poor folks they go to work or they go to war[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
I did fifteen hundreds days in the corps [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
and I got back nothin looked the same anymore[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
I got on with the local police, it just seemed to fit[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
Things have changed[/tab]

[ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch]   [ch]F#m7[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]

[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
By then David had a daughter and a son [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
and a wrap sheet to prove all the time that he'd done[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
He was just a burned out beat down shell, of my old friend[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]                       
And on a three day binge he was speeding through town,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
and I bumped the wailers just to try and slow him down[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
He didn't know that it was me, and he took off[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bm[/ch]
Oh how things change[/tab]


[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
And I found his truck in the floodplain upside down[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]F#m[/ch]
It was a hell of a rain I didn't know if he'd drowned,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]
or if he died on impact. It must have rolled three times[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Yeah the only thing to make matters worse[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]F#m[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]
is that his mama's a late night ER    nurse [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
And he was DOA. She just about lost her mind[/tab]


[ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch]   [ch]F#m7[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]


[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
David's wife drops by every once in a while,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
and childhood stories always make her smile,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
but somehow we always go back to that day...[/tab]


[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]

[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]
Ain't it the times[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Some folks like to look, they like to point[/tab]

They like to push, they like to shove 
[tab]                                                                    [ch]G[/ch]
Some folks like to talk about the things they have, the things they love[/tab]
[tab]                                                                      [ch]C[/ch]
But things are that just things, and I don't give a damn, I must seem trite[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I'm not that old, I'm not too young[/tab]

I'm not too smart, I sure ain't dumb

I walked around and round and round most every place
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                                                               [ch]C[/ch]
I've been found and all I've found is most places usually seem the same to me[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]     
And I talk with people off the street[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]F[/ch]
My line of work I tend to meet, the kind of folk that seem like minded[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]                 
Those of us just trying to find our way, so let's just meet up at some place[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
We can sort it out[/tab]
[ch]C[/ch] walk down [ch]G[/ch] to [ch]Am[/ch]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
And I talk with people off the street         [/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]F[/ch]
My line of work I tend to meet the kind of folk that seem like minded[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Am[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
Those of us just trying to find our way, so let's just meet up at some place[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
We can sort it out[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
This god-forsaken world it chews you up and spits you out[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]F[/ch]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
It scuffs your shoes, it takes most everything you got and then it tries you with the blues[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]                                                 [ch]G[/ch]
But that's alright the blues is something that proves that you still feel[/tab]

[ch]C[/ch] 3x walk down [ch]G[/ch] to [ch]Am[/ch]


[Verse]

Some folks like to look, they like to point[/tab]

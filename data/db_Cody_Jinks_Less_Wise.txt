[Verse]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
Time is gold and it only[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
Goes by in waves of strangers[/tab]
[tab] [ch]B[/ch]
Along the way sometimes[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
strangers make your friends[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C#m[/ch]
Well, I'm gettin' old and my friends[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
Don't come around like they used to[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]B[/ch]
We've stopped actin' like we've[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]
got somethin' to prove[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]
My old friend Jake, yeah man[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
We made some noise in those barrooms[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]
Who'd have thought he'd be[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]
The first one with a son[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch] 
And I like to think that guy[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
We all call McKinney[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]B[/ch]
He was there at my worst[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
And Lord knows he's helped me on[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]                [ch]C#m[/ch]         
It's been a few years since I[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
Seen that Matthews boy[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]                  
He's still livin' down in Houston[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
Still never call him back when I phone[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]
Every now and then I'll stop[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
And I'll have a few with Vinny[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]B[/ch]
You know we laugh about the old times[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]
At least those we recall[/tab]

[Chorus]
N.C.
It's always...
[tab][ch]A[/ch] [ch]C#m[/ch]    [ch]B[/ch]
C'est la vi...[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]C#m[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]
Try not to miss the forest for the trees[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]C#m[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
And now we're what we did not think we'd be[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]C#m[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]
A little bit older, a little less wise[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]C#m[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]
You get a little older and a lot less wise[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
Time is gold and it only[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
Goes by in waves of strangers...[/tab]

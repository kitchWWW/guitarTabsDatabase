[Intro]
[ch]Bm[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab]   [ch]Bm[/ch]
He wakes with the chickens and the Waco sun[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
He's got mouths to feed and cattle to run[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
Same as his daddy and his daddy done[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
It's all he's ever known[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
In this modern world movin' break-neck fast[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
He's a dyin' breed, a thing of the past[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
He'll be damned if he don't hit back[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
If you stand in his way[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
When there's nothin' more to say[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
So here's to the lifers[/tab]

The struggle-and-strifers
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
Workin' long after the day is done[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Here's to the broke-backs[/tab]

The cowboys in old hats
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
The last of the Great Generation[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]
It seems they still dream[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
She's a renaissance girl with a fire in her soul[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
She's got a pocket full of nothin', nobody tells her "no"[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]
She flew into town twenty years ago[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
With a guitar and a song[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]
She's been playin' them rooms but she ain't got far[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Been livin' off tips in them Broadway bars[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
She's a troubadour queen but time left its mark[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
The scene's passed her by[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
In a world that's passed her by[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
So here's to the lifers[/tab]

The struggle-and-strifers
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
Workin' long after the day is done[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Here's to the broke-backs[/tab]

The cowboys in old hats
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
The last of the Great Generation[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]
It seems they still dream[/tab]


[Solo]
[ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
[ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]


[Bridge]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
No, they don't give up and they don't give in[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
When things don't go their way[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah we're gettin' knocked down, yeah we're gettin' back up[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
Live to die another day[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
So here's to the lifers[/tab]

The struggle-and-strifers
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
Workin' long after the day is done[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Here's to the broke-backs[/tab]

The cowboys in old hats
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
The last of the Great Generation[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]
It seems they still dream[/tab]

[Outro]

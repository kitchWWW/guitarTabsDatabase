[Intro]
[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]  (x2)


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
They say it's a lost highway, it must be a ride[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
Cause I've been driving for years, and it's just beyond my sights[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch]
I am too far gone to be turning around, so I just look ahead and drive[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                                          [ch]Am[/ch]
I remember the way it always made m feel when David Allan sang "The Ride"[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
It takes you up, it takes you down, the road don't end, it just goes around[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you live... and die[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And what I have lost, what I have gained[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
It's all to none, it's still the same.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
I will drive until I find, until I find, that lost highway[/tab]


[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
Many others have travelled this road, I try to steer clear[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Of all the wreckage and the shattered souls forgotten every year[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
And the ghosts that walk on the side of the road[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
Say to turn your car around[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
Well one day son you'll be walking with us[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Searching for what can't be found[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
It takes you up, it takes you down, the road don't end, it just goes around[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you live... and die[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And what I have lost, what I have gained[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
It's all to none, it's still the same.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
I will drive until I find, until I find, that lost highway[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And what I have lost, what I have gained[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
It's all to none, it's still the same.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]
I will drive until I find, until I find, that lost highway[/tab]

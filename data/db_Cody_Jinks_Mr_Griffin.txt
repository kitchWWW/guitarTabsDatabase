[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
He arrived in '72[/tab]

Hollowed eyes and everyone knew
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
He was running[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#m[/ch]
He was scared[/tab]

Laif claim to that 730 mine

Did well busting rocks in the pines
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]
That silver and gold[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]F#m[/ch]
Was all a young man could want[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
In the evenings you'd hear him play[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
His fiddle rings to the end of day[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
He was digging for the plans they made[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
He was digging his own grave[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Where's your love, Mr. Griffin[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]
It's been rumored that she died[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]
The night before your wedding day[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
Is that right, Mr. Griffin[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
Does that fiddle prior hurting tune[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]B[/ch]                    [ch]F#m[/ch]
On the tune of the murdering hand[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
He stayed away from the girls and the booze[/tab]

All the things he thought he might loose
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]
All that money he made[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F#m[/ch]
Or the secrets he kept[/tab]

One June night, lord, that fiddle play was hot

Then the valley rang out with a shot
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
When we found him, he was face down[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F#m[/ch]
In the hole he had dug[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
They still say you can hear him play[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]
His fiddle rings through the end of day[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
He was digging for his debt to pay[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]
He was digging his own grave[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]

Murdering hand[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
It must be really love if you’re willing[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]C[/ch]
To stand in the center of the fire[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause lately everything that I touch[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Seems to burn to the ground[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
I’ve looked in 30 pairs of eyes[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Tryna find, all the light you had in yours[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 1]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
But something in me cannot seem[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
To close the door[/tab]


[Chorus 1]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
I'd go walking in the mornings by the lake[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Where we used to swim on Sundays[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I have memories of a girl[/tab]

Out by the lamppost
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
In a dress and shiny shoes[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I can never seem to get it[/tab]

Through my mind
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
That I might always be blue[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause I will never find another you[/tab]


[Verse 2]

Is it really truth
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]
If you have to search the world[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
To try to find it?[/tab]

Or should I practice patience for the day
[tab]                          [ch]C[/ch]
That you burst back into view?[/tab]

If I saw you on the street would it be instant
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Or would we have to be reintroduced?[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 2]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
These are things I wonder with the moon[/tab]


[Chorus 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
All I want for Christmas[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]C[/ch]
Is to feel the way I felt when I was 17[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
When I had you on my chest out on a boat[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
On an evening in June[/tab]


Little did I know that was the gladdest
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
That I was ever allowed to be[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Too soon did it all fade from view[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Oh now I will never find another you[/tab]


[Chorus 3]

Now I'm stuck in New York City
[tab]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
With a job and I heard you're out in Paris[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Now I'm thinking about the night I took you out[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And we were dancing on the roof[/tab]

I was writing you a letter
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
And then I realized[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I had no place to send it to[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Now I‘ve finally come to terms with[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
The truth[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Oh that I will never find a—nother you[/tab]

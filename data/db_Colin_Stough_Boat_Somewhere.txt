[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
Boss just hit me with a list of shit that ain't gettin' done today[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                                                        [ch]G[/ch]
Well, it'll probably be a problem but it ain't my problem, there's a cold beer callin' my name[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
And a green eyed blonde and a Yamaha and the sun is a 90 degrees[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]
As a matter of fact you can kiss my ass, yeah it don't make a damn to me[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause I'll be on a boat somewhere[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
I'm livin' it up like a millionaire[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, I'll be in an old lawn chair[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
Nothing but wind blowin' through my hair[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]
I'm lookin' for the bottom of the bottle[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]
With a wide open throttle down deep in some swampy air[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah, I'll be on a boat somewhere[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch]
It's 14 foot from the front to back that was handed on down to mе[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
It's got a spray paint job from a boy named Bob, somewherе between brown and green[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch]
Some say it's slow, some say it's fast, some say it's made for catching bass[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
But if you ask me one thing you'll see is hauling that Mississippi back[/tab]

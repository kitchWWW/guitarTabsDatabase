Standin' by a cotton field  a little north of Bakersfield[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Valley heat and dust likin' to choke me[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Tryin' hard to thumb a ride  holdin' up my weary pride[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]

[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
That old wood stove in Mama's   country kitchen[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
And every car that passes by  I cuss and tell myself that I[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Can't get back home nor anywhere's  by hitchin'[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
And I wish I'd never left old   Oklahoma[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
 I never had no money but  at least I had a wife[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
She begged me not to leave old   Oklahoma[/tab]

 I never had no money there   at least we had a life[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
When the sun's a goin' down   Needles ain't no kind'a town[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
For a guy like me  to be in  broke and walkin'[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause if a cop should happen by  ten to one he'd stop  and I[/tab]

I reckon I'd be outta state  but only if I'd caught a freight[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
Back in Bakersfield but somethin'  wouldn't let me[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Well if you believe in Okie's God  give this country boy a nod[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Or send some kinda Angel here to get me[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
And I wish I'd never left old Oklahoma[/tab]

Mama hated diesels so bad[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
I guess I knew it was something to do with dad[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                                         [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]
The first time I ever seen her cry, was after one of them things went by[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]

[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
I remember hearin' those semis gearing down[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
My mom and me lived right on the high grade end of town[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                                      [ch]D[/ch]
I sure loved them white freighters, but there was somethin' in Mama's eyes[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                                               [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
when she'd catch me watching the road, lord, a little bitty piece of her died[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A/D[/ch]
Mama hated diesels so bad[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
I guess I knew it was something to do with dad[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                                         [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]
The first time I ever seen her cry, was after one of them things went by[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Mama hated diesels so bad[/tab]

[Verse 2] (Spoken)

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
As the years passed and I grew older, mama did too[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
Pretty soon she stopped singin' and  laughin', well, she'd hardly even eat[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I began staying away from home on the weekdays, and wouldn't come home from school till' [/tab]
way after dark
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I was always too busy havin' fun either messing around with some girl or hanging around [/tab]
the truckstop
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
or talking too my buddies about about the big rigs that were all the time rollin' in[/tab]
[tab]                                                       [ch]A[/ch]
Or talking about all the crazy places we never been, like California[/tab]

[Verse 3] (Spoken)

[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
Well, one day the county sheriff came up to me                                         [/tab]
[tab]                                                                                   [ch]D[/ch]                                                        [ch]G[/ch]
He said they found my mama wandering all by herself in the middle of the highway cryin'[/tab]
                                                                                       
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
She was trying of all things Lord, to flag down one of them rigs with a pocket handkerchief[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Well, that left me all on my own[/tab]

[Verse 4] (Spoken)

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I got a job unloadin' rigs down at the local frieght yard[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
Pretty soon I got a rig of my own and I left hometown on my very first runt to Frisco[/tab]
[tab]                                                                                    [ch]A[/ch]
That was three years ago today, and I ain't been home in all that time since then, till now[/tab]

[Verse 5] (Sing)

[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
Now it's me and the local preacher, standing in the graveyard grass[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
Staring down at the highway, watching those big boys pass[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Well he laid his hand upon me and he prayed for quite some time                          [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
I could barely understand the words he said behind that highways whine[/tab]

[Verse 6] (Spoken)

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                             [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
He handed me a faded photograph, he said he found it in my mama's hand[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                                        [ch]A[/ch]
He said , I'm afraid you and this picture were the best your mama ever had[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
Well I looked down at that picture, it was Mama and some guy[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
standing beside a semi- truck, "just married" written on the side[/tab]

[Chorus-Outro]

[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A/D[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
I guess I knew it was something to do with dad[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]
The first time I ever seen her cry was after one of them things went by[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]

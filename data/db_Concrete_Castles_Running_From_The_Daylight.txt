Key: 


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
It's been a weird night[/tab]

And everybody's getting wild; they don't wanna go home
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
A little moonshine[/tab]

Soak up my problems 'til they really feel like nothing at all

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
A life I can't remember[/tab]

Darkness, stay forever
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Stitch me back together[/tab]

The best I've ever felt, I just want to stay in Hell

Yeah, I'm

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]
Bleeding from my eyes, never gonna cry[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Now it's do or die, running from the daylight[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
Have we had enough? What have we become?[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Nowhere left to hide, running from the daylight[/tab]

[Verse 2]
I want the nightmares
I want the voices in my head, I want 'em taking control
All of the poison I'm drinking, it's numbing my thinking
I love what I'm feeling, feel nothing at all

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]
Bleeding from my eyes, never gonna cry[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Now it's do or die, running from the daylight[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
Have we had enough? What have we become?[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Nowhere left to hide, running from the daylight[/tab]


[Post-Chorus]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Running from the daylight[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]
Bleeding from my eyes, never gonna cry[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Now it's do or die, running from the daylight[/tab]

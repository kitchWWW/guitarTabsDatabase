Good old days – Concrete sneaker

Intro:  [ch]Cm7[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Bbm7[/ch] [ch]Db[/ch]                [ch]Cm7[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Bbm7[/ch] [ch]Db[/ch]                

Verse
[tab][ch]Cm7[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Bbm7[/ch] [ch]Db[/ch]                [ch]Cm7[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Bbm7[/ch] [ch]Db[/ch]                (repeat)
I wish I could go back in time (back to the sixties)[/tab]
Then I would hear Bob Dylan sing (and Janis Joplin)
Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash (those were the days)
Some good old days

And I don’t want to say that the music from nowadays
Means nothing ‘cause it means something to someone
If I could be Michael J. Fox 
I would step in my DeLorean time machine and travel to those

Chorus: 
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                [ch]Bbm[/ch] [ch]Db[/ch]                [ch]Eb[/ch]                [ch]Bbm[/ch] [ch]Db[/ch]                (repeat)
Ooh ooh, I want those good old days[/tab]
Long gone away but the memory’s still the same, oh
Ooh ooh, I want those good old days
Long gone away but the memory’s still the same, oh

Interlude
[ch]Cm7[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Bbm7[/ch] [ch]Db[/ch]                [ch]Cm7[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Bbm7[/ch] [ch]Db[/ch]                

Verse
[tab][ch]Cm7[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Bbm7[/ch] [ch]Db[/ch]                [ch]Cm7[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Bbm7[/ch] [ch]Db[/ch]                (repeat)
I wish I could go back in time (back to the sixties)[/tab]
Then I would hear James Brown scream (and Otis Redding)
Lennon,  Crosby, Stills and Nash (those were the days)
Some good old days

I’m forgetting Neil Young and … and Jimi Hendrix
Meant something to me man, something more to me
If I could be Michael J. Fox 
I would step in my DeLorean time machine and travel to those

Chorus 

[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                [ch]Bbm[/ch] [ch]Db[/ch]                [ch]Ab[/ch]                [ch]Ab[/ch]                
Ooh ooh, I want those good old days[/tab]

Bridge:
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                [ch]Bbm[/ch] [ch]Db[/ch]                [ch]Ab[/ch]                [ch]Ab[/ch]                (4x)
With all the CD’s, DVD’s, I watch them all on my TV[/tab]
Every day the same old tune but still it’s not the same
It’s not the same
With all the CD’s, DVD’s, I watch them all on my TV
Every day the same old tune but still it’s not the same
It’s not the same

Chorus 2x

[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
We lived alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
My house and I[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
We had the earth[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
We had the sky[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
I had a lamp[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Against the dark[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And I was happy[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
As a lark[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
We lived alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
My house and I[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
We had the earth[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
We had the sky[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
I had a lamp[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Against the dark[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And I was happy[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
As a lark[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
I had a stove and a window screen[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
I had a table painted green[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
Sat on a chair with a broken back[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
Wearing a pretty potato sack[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
I had a rug upon my floor[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
And roses grew around my door[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
I had a job, my wants were few[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
They were until I wanted you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
And when I set my eyes on you[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Nothing else would do[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Nothing else would do[/tab]

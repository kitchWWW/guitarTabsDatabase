Artist: Corb Lund
Song: 90 Seconds Of Your Time
Genre: 
Key: C


I recommend playing all these chords as bar or power chords. I think that that sounds more faithful to the
song than open voicings.

Also note that I have this tabbed so that it's really easy to play the bass lick entering the chorus. I think
that's a nice lick that gives it a lot of oomph but if you don't want to play this, you can transpose the
whole song down a half step (so it's B and E in the verse) with the capo on 1 and it's easier to play.

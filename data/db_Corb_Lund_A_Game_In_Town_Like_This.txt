Playin' late night crazy pot size games with the Asian dealers who[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
With all that tax free money got deeper pockets than I do[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
I can't fade that kind of action but my name's there on the list[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Gm[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
Stuck in chilly morning traffic cuz I always played too long[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Headed north across the bridge and wish'n you were there at home[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#m[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
You used to wake all sleepy headed and ask me if I won[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Gm[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Sometimes I'd just say nothing and now I'm living with what I've done.[/tab]


[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I'm a losin' lately gambler but that's not all I've ever been[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Gm[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Cuttin' back your losses is just another way to win.[/tab]


[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]
The chips were racked and ready and I was standing up to leave[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Looked down and caught a diamond queen tuggin' at my sleeve[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
My bleary, up-all-nighted eyes misread it for a heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Gm[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Now the money's gone, it's just past dawn and we're a half world apart.[/tab]


[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I'm a losin' lately gambler but that's not all I've ever been[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch]
I sat down with 'em one last time as I passed thru months ago[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Donated a couple thousand, smiled, stood up and hit the road.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch] 
With that old familiar empty feelin' of time and treasure lost[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Gm[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
The game's the same, ain't nothin's changed except now I know the cost[/tab]


[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
I'm a losin' lately gambler but I've booked my share of wins[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I still see some value there but my edge is pretty thin[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I'm a losin' lately gambler but that's not all I've ever been[/tab]

I can't fade that kind of action but my name's there on the list[/tab]

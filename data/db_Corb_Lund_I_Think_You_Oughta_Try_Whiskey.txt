[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
You strut around the room and act like I'm not even there (sometimes you're not)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
You slur your words and paw at every rich man through the door[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]

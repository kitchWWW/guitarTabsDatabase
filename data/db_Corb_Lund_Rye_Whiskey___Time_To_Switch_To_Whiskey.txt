Song: Rye Whiskey - Time To Switch To Whiskey
Genre: 
Key: G


[Intro]
N.C.
Rye whiskey, rye whiskey, rye whiskey, I cried.
N.C.
If I don’t get rye whiskey well I think I may die.
N.C.
I’m gonna go up beyond that holler, gonna build me a still
N.C.
And I’ll sell you a gallon for a five dollar bill.
N.C.
Well, If the oceans was whiskey and I was a duck,
N.C.
I’d swim to the bottoms and never come up.
N.C.
But the oceans ain’t whiskey and I ain’t no duck,
N.C.
So I’ll play the jack o’ diamonds and trust to my luck.
N.C.
Jack of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds, you know you hold
N.C.
You've robbed my poor pockets of silver and gold.
N.C.
Well it’s beefsteak when I'm hungry, rye whiskey when I’m dry,
N.C.
Greenbacks when I’m hard up and heaven when I die.
N.C.
Rye whiskey, rye whiskey, rye whiskey, I cried.
N.C.
If I don’t get rye whiskey well I think I may die.
N.C.
Well, my horses ain’t hungry and they don’t want your hay.
N.C.
Fair thee well darling, and I'll be on my way.

Here’s to it folks...

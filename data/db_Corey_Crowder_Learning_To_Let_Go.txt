Am I wasting my breath? Because its still in my mind

[tab]                   [ch]Em7[/ch]                [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
that its always the wrong place at the wrong time[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D/F[/ch] #
So lets face the facts, we all make mistakes[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]Em7[/ch]                        [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
But we've got to live life, before it passes right by[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]Em7[/ch]                   [ch]D/F#[/ch]
So before you pack your things and go[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]Em7[/ch]                    [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Theres one last thing that I want you to know[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D/F#[/ch]                [ch]Em7[/ch]
You cant find happiness if you wont let go[/tab]

[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
We can agree on one thing[/tab]

[tab]                        [ch]D/F#[/ch]
You cant fight fate with fate[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Em7[/ch]                         [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
We had a good love, but its seen its last day[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D/F#[/ch]
When opportunity knocked you had to answer the call[/tab]

[tab]                        [ch]Em7[/ch]                [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Now those clouds on that sunny day have all blown away[/tab]

(Repeat the Chorus)


[tab]       [ch]Em7[/ch]                    [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Open your eyes[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Cadd9[/ch]        [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Youre bound to get hurt sometime[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
It's hard to believe the boys are raising a drink[/tab]

'Cause Jimmy's twenty-four[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                           [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]

Well, tomorrow night it's back to the grind[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
Got a downtown show in the Ft. Worth lights[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]

When the crowds go home[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
When the last note plays[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
When the lights go out[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
On an empty stage[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Na it don't matter how far I go[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]

If I've got a back porch waiting at home[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
  Everybody's trying to find their place[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
Here in the real world[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                                 [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
  Some still raising hell some settled down with a good girl[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]
Yeah, we're talking getting rich paying bills,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Buying cars & falling in love[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                             [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
  Acting like we know but we're all still just growing up[/tab]

  Just string lights hanging over some two-by-fours[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                      [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
  Funny how the little things turn into so much more[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]

[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Laughter's loud and the drinks are cold[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                                     [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
  They're the spoke in the wheel that keeps me rolling down the road[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
But when the crowds go home[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
When the last note plays[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
When the lights go out[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
On an empty stage[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Na it don't matter how far I go[/tab]

Or how long it's been[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
If I've got a back porch waiting at home[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
And a few good friends[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
As long as I've got a few good friends) Oh, and a few good[/tab]

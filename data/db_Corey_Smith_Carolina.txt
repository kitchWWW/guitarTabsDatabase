[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Me and you in a midnight blue, 82 Camaro[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]  
Crossin over the Hartwell bridge movin fast as she would go[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Windows down, radio up, we were singin Freebird[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Flyin up to your daddys cabin just outside of Spartanburg[/tab]


Chorus 1:
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                             [ch]D[/ch]
Do you remember the way you looked at me back then[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                            [ch]D[/ch]
Two hungry eyes wrapped up in a smile so innocent[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
It all makes one hell of a reminder[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch] 
Keeps me cryin Carolina, Carolina[/tab]


We had a hotel room with a harbor view and a bottle of Chianti
That spring break in Charleston, it keeps comin back to haunt me
Took a carriage ride to the battery, toasted shots above the water
Then stumbled cross the cobblestone, hands holdin us together


Chorus 2:
Do you remember the way we carried on
Blew all our money and we had to starve the whole way home
It all makes one hell of a reminder
Keeps me cryin Carolina


Bridge:
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Em/F#[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]Em/F#[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
    I cant let it go, no I cant let it go[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]Em/F#[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
I dont wanna let go, oh no it feels too far away[/tab]


Chorus 3:
Do you remember the single bed that we slept in
When Id ride up to Clemson and hide in your room the whole weekend
It all makes one hell of a reminder
Keeps me cryin Carolina

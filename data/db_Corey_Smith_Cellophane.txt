[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Cellophane[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
The front pocket of my blue jeans[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
A little fire and a little green[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Enough to make me king[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
On a Friday night[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
In a trailer off of Dry Pond Road[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Where me and the boys would go to get loaded[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
And hide out from the law whoaaa[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
It was just a weekend thing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
A little help for the alcohol[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
It was no big deal[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Was just a weekend thing[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Sleep it off on the couch[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]Em7[/ch]
And don't get behind the wheel[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]                    [ch]Em7[/ch]
Break it out, I want a taste[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
What you got in that cellophane?[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
A bunch of kids[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Same feather, same kinda cool[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
We dropped out of the Sunday school[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
And made up our own rules[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
For a few good years[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Before the cops came sniffin' round[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Before they took our dope man down[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
And good shit got hard to find Ohhhhh[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
It was just a weekend thing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Some compliments for the alcohol[/tab]

It was no big deal[/tab]

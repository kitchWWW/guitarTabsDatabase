[Verse 1]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
I’s out in Daddy’s woodshop about 17 years old[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
Stacking up some lumber, sweeping sawdust off the floor[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Way over in the corner, I smelled something kind of strange[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
I looked behind a can of paint and found a bag of Mary Jane[/tab]

I thought “What the hell is this?”


[Verse 2]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
It threw me for a loop… had me feeling all mixed up[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Cause Daddy always told me only hippies smoke that stuff[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Well I knew damn good and well he wasn’t leaning to the left[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
And he’d rather die and go to hell than listen to the Grateful Dead[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
The day I found my Daddy’s weed[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
I knew the truth and it set me free[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
That’s when I learned this apple didn’t fall far from the tree[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
I did a lot of growing up the day I found my Daddy’s weed[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Now, Mom was getting groceries and Dad was out of town[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
So I sat there on the workbench contemplating what I’d found[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I went from feeling kinda pissed to thinking “What the hell?”[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
I got my bowl out of the truck and broke off a little for myself[/tab]

You’re damn right!


[Verse 4]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
That shit was awful sticky… it had crystals on the leaves[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Smelled kinda like a skunk and kinda like a Christmas tree[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
It might of come from California or maybe Colorado[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
But it was on a different level than what I’s getting down the road[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
The day I found my Daddy’s weed[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
It’s one of my favor-ite memories[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
That’s when I learned this apple didn’t fall far from the tree[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
I did a lot of growing up the day I found my Daddy’s weed[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I only hit it once and damn it hit me hard[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
I flew straight to the moon and back sitting in the yard[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
And suddenly I understood why Daddy loved to work so much[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
When we heard him out there coughing… it wasn’t from the dust[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
The day I found my Daddy’s weed…[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]   
Aw, it still gets to me…[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
The little blonde haired boy who used to bounce upon his knee[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Became the man out in the backyard stoned on Daddy’s weed[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
All messed up on Daddy’s weed![/tab]

[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Daddy’s weed…[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Daddy’s weed…[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Stoned on Daddy’s weed…[/tab]

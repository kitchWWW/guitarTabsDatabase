Intro

[ch]A[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]        
Feels like a Friday night [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
But it's only Monday afternoon[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch] 
Still there's a party goin' on in my livin' room [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
It's just me and fifth of Beam [/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Swayin' to the sounds of old George Jones[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
And it won't be long 'til the whole damn bottle's gone [/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]F#m[/ch]
And I know it might sound sad [/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
But to tell the truth it ain't half bad[/tab]
 
I love my misery 
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                                  
Gonna drown my blues in a sea of whiskey [/tab]


[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
I'm drinkin' again [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Tryin' hard to hide the pain I'm in [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]C#m[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
So don't give me any shit, I know just what I'm gettin' in[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch] 
Sure, it's a sin but I don't really give a damn[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]F#m[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch] 
I'm drinkin' again [/tab]


[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I've got no friends to call [/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
They've all straightened up and settled down[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch] 
And they don't ever wanna hang around [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
But I guess I understand [/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
This house ain't much for company [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
Smells like a cesspool here, It's stinkin' nasty [/tab]
 
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
And you might say I'm bad off [/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
But I chose the road I strumbled across[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
I picked my poison Give me another shot of bourbon [/tab]

[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
Cause I'm drinkin' again[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch] 
Tryin' hard to hide the pain I'm in[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]C#m[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch] 
So don't give me any shit, I know just what I'm gettin in [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Sure, it's a sin but I don't really give a damn[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch] 
I'm drinkin' again [/tab]

[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
Well fortunately for me I find relief[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m[/ch] 
When the world is weighin' down on me [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
I pop a top, I take a shot, I drop a pill[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch] 
Turn the radio up, sit back and chill[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
Pretend my life is a bed of roses [/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Try not to notice all the ghosts[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch] 
That are hauntin me and tauntin me [/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
And wantin me to cut my wrists [/tab]

So they can watch me bleed
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
And laugh at me, as I scream in agony [/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
I get high for the sake of my family [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Cause the alcohol is all that's helpin me [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
To cope since I went broke and lost my hope [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I kicked my girl to the curb of the road [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F#m[/ch]
You know I couldn't afford to support us both [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Hell I'm not rich, don't have a good job [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
Do construction work with this dude named Bob[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]  
And he's an ass. Yells at me all the time [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#m[/ch]
Pays minimum wage on overtime[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch] 
Still he's got it made, drives an Escalade [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
And gets two hundred times what I get paid [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
But that's okay. [/tab]
                                      
I'll drink to his health and ruin mine 
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
I'll chug liquor and he can sip red wine [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
And I'll be fine. Trying to find some peace [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
I'll quit payin' my rent and I'll break my lease[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch] 
I'll live out on the streets and beg for change [/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Crawl in a box when it starts to rain [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
Forget my family and my friends [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]

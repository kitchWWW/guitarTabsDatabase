[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                            [ch]D/F#[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
A long ride back from Jacksonville, 500 miles from a game we should've won[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch] 
Man, we oughta' burn down that stadium[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Thought this year was gonna' be ours, talkin' too much junk in those Florida bars[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]G/F#[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch] 
Now I'm stunned, man, I wish it was Nineteen Eighty One[/tab]


Chorus:
[tab][ch]D[/ch]             [ch]D/F#[/ch]
And I know why they say[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Every dawg has his days[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Can't win every game we play[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
But every dawg has his days[/tab]


Longing for those glory days like the one when he cried, "Run, Lindsey, Run!"
I was too young to be there, but I'm sure it was fun
Bet that crowd was flyin' high and I bet Glory to Ol' Georgia was cried as the band played
Man, I wish I could feel that way today


Chorus

Bridge:
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
And I play back my favorite victories[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch] 
Like that last minute win up in Tennessee[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
I bet them hobnails hurt like hell[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
And I got sweet memories of 2002[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
Won the SEC and the Sugar Bowl, too[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Man, we had a ball on Bourbon Street[/tab]
[tab][ch]D/F#[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]    
Whoa, whoa, those were the days[/tab]


Just got my tickets in the mail, September's coming fast and I can hardly wait
They say these guys, they might take us all the way
And if they do I'll be flyin' high and there'll prob'ly be a happy tear in my eye
But rain or shine, I'll be yellin' "Go Dawgs!" from the 20-yard line

Chorus


Tag:
And we'll be singin', 
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
"Glory, glory to ol' Georgia, [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Glory, glory to ol' Georgia, [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
Glory, glory to ol' Georgia, [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, Georgia, hail to thee."[/tab]

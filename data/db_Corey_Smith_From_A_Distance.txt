[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Amanda was a small town blonde haired beauty [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
She had Heaven in her eyes and could light up a room [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch]
When she walked into view, she was the prettiest girl in my school [/tab]

And I knew she'd never give me the time of day 
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]
No girls like her ever looked twice my way [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
She was out of my league[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]D7[/ch] 
Oh, but that was alright with me [/tab]

[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Cause I loved her from a distance [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Like an angel watching from afar [/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
I never had the nerve to mention [/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
The fire burning in my heart[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch] 
I knew a boy like me never woulda stood a chance [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
So I did the best I could [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Gsus[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
And I loved her from a distance [/tab]


The Homecoming dance of our senior year 
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
I finally got my courage up enough to overcome my fears [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
I would have asked her to dance [/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
But her boyfriend never gave me a chance [/tab]

Every step of every song they swung the night away 
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
And I wish I could have wrapped my arms around her waist [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
And told her how I cared [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]D7[/ch]
Instead I only stood there and stared [/tab]


[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Cause I loved her from a distance [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Like an angel watching from afar [/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
I never had the nerve to mention [/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
The fire burning in my heart[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch] 
I knew a boy like me never woulda stood a chance [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
So I did the best I could [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Gsus[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
And I loved her from a distance [/tab]

[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]D7[/ch]


[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
The other night I saw her, first time in years [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]
My heart skipped a beat when she came walking near [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
In those faded blue jeans [/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
She's still the prettiest girl I've seen [/tab]

And much to my surprise she said hello 
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
And that she loved listening to me singing on the radio [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
I said that's a funny funny thing [/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]D7[/ch]
Cause your in every song I sing [/tab]

[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Yes I've been loving you from a distance [/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Gsus[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
Since you were only seventeen [/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]C[/ch]
But I never had the nerve to mention [/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
The feelings flowing inside me [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
I knew a boy like me never woulda stood a chance [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]D7[/ch]
So I poured my heart into the music that I made [/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And I kept loving you from a distance [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Oh and now we have a story book romance [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]D7[/ch]
And I know one thing's for sure [/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
This love can go the distance[/tab]

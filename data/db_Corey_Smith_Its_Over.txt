Key: F#/Gb[/tab]
Capo 3

So there are hardly any chord charts for Corey Smith songs and this is my absolute favorite, so I figured I'd
post it. This is the way I play it and make it sound as close to Corey as I can because I'm nowhere near the
guitarist Corey is. He plays open barre chords throughout the song and no capo. He is tuned down a half step
and then in drop D. So I play capo on the 3rd fret. You can play open but these chords are relative to the
capo and a half step down and drop D tuning. It's a real fun and interesting song to play. Give it a listen
and hear all the little things he does and make it your own. I hope yall enjoy!!

I've been beaten, I've been abused[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
I've been cheated and I've been used[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
They said that I'm no good[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Heart stone cold, black and blue[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Reminder of the shit they put me through[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Oh, it's getting' old[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Time to show myself the door[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
Where I'm goin', I don't know[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
Somewhere down this dusty road[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
North on 441[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
Past the rollin' cattle fields, the trailer parks and rusted cotton mills[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Lord, get me outta' here[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
I've made up my mind[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
I'm not givin' in this time[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
It's over[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
I'M A HEARTBREAK RUNAWAY[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
ON A FAST RIDE TOWARD THE INTERSTATE[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
I'M LEAVIN' THIS PLACE WITHOUT A MINUTE TO WASTE[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
NO LOOKIN' OVER MY SHOULDER[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]

Been in prison locked in chains, Bible beat into my brain[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
They said you gotta' trust and obey[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
But I've busted loose, I'm on the run, screamin' at the top of my lungs[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Thank God I'm free at last[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
Feel like I've been reborn[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
There's no pretending anymore[/tab]


Bridge (D G throughout entire bridge)

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Daddy's been drinkin' beers, every night for twenty years[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
And Mama just sits there on the couch, poppin' pills to drown her tears[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
And they keep doggin' me, you're not worth a damn and your just gonna' be[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Another failure and a jailbird like everyone in the family[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
So I hang out in a parkin' lot, get stoned with my two friends[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
‘Cause there the ones who understand the situation that I'm in[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
They feel my pain and man I'm gonna miss ‘em when I'm gone[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
But I'm movin' on, ‘cause if I don't I'll be dead by twenty-one[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
I'll shoot myself in the head before I wind up like my dad[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Workin' a job I hate and takin' out my anger on a kid[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
I can hear my Mama cryin', as I cross that county line[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
‘Cause she knows I'm not comin' back[/tab]

I'm leavin' all this shit behind
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
I told her I'm a soldier, I'm wiser and I'm older[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
I got my education now I'm outta' here[/tab]

It's over


[Chorus]

[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
I'M A HEARTBREAK RUNAWAY[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
ON A FAST RIDE TOWARD THE INTERSTATE[/tab]

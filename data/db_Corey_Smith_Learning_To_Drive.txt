[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
I got my Chevrolet keys the first week of June[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
It was my daddy's ol' truck but I had it looking like new[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
I went straight to her house took her out for a spin[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I kept my hands to myself 'cause we were still just friends[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Back then, we swore, we'd never be more, but[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Two hands on the wheel turned into one on her knee[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
Takin' it slow turned into pickin' up speed[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Keepin' my eyes on the road turned into lookin' in hers[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Ridin' the brakes turned into huggin' them curves[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, that summеr flew by[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Learnin' to drive, lеarnin' to drive[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
That July was hot and my AC didn't work[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Kept the windows rolled down and that was fine by her[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
She'd turn the radio loud let her blonde hair fly[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Lift her sunglasses up and show the green in her eyes[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em7[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
As she'd sing every line, to "Strawberry Wine"[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
And two hands on the wheel turned into one on her knee[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
Takin' it slow turned into pickin' up speed[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Keepin' my eyes on the road turned into lookin' in hers[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Ridin' the brakes turned into huggin' them curves[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, that summеr flew by[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Learnin' to drive, lеarnin' to drive[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
August was a flash my foot stayed heavy on the gas[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I hung her necklace on the mirror put her picture on the dash[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I told her I loved her but she never said it back[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I thought we'd last forever but that summer's all we had[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Too fast, too far, wound up wreckin' my heart[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
And two hands on the wheel turned into one on her knee[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
Takin' it slow turned into pickin' up speed[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Keepin' my eyes on the road turned into lookin' in hers[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Ridin' the brakes turned into huggin' them curves[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Yeah, that summеr flew by[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]Em7[/ch]
Left me with tears in my eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Kissed my innocence goodbye[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Learnin' to drive, learnin' to drive[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
Learnin' to drive, that summer flew by[/tab]

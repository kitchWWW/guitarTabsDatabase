Dropped all my quarters at the Lee Street car wash[/tab]

Washed off that note someone wrote on the dirty window[/tab]

Now my Beretta's lookin' good as new[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]            Asus3             [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, just for you it's lookin' good as new[/tab]

No one's been ridin' with me for a long while
So I'm bein' careful tryin' to watch my speed
But it's gettin' hard to keep my eyes on the highway
Knowin' you're over in the passenger seat

[tab][ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
My heart, be still, I'm havin' trouble breathin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
Wonderin' if you feel the same way that I'm feelin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
Cold sweat, so strange, I can't play it cool[/tab]

My heart's out on a limb, and girl you'd be somethin' to lose[/tab]

Waited two hours for a haircut down at Jerry's
He cleaned me up and then I headed home
I put on a new shirt and double-dosed in Cool Water
Stared in the bathroom mirror way too long
Wonderin' if I turn you on

And I know tonight might seem like dinner and a movie
But to me, it means much, much more
Cause I'm bettin' my whole heart that you're gonna love me
And I've never took that kinda chance before

My heart, be still, I'm havin' trouble breathin'
Wonderin' if you feel the same way that I'm feelin'
Cold sweat, so strange, I can't play it cool
My heart's out on a limb, and girl you'd be somethin' to lose
You'd be somethin' to lose

You, me, we should get together now            |
Cause love may never give another chance       |Same Chords
Please don't be afraid to let me in            | As Chorus
Cause we may never get this moment back again__|


My heart, be still, I'm havin' trouble breathin'
Wonderin' if you feel the same way that I'm feelin'
Cold sweat, so strange, I can't play it cool
My heart's out on a limb, and girl you'd be somethin' to lose

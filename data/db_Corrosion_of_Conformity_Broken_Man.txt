[Verse]

Deep in the soul of a man whose seen it all
He stands alone with borrowed time
Dealing with two nothings new but the look at you
With broken backs and bleeding minds
And tell you they now even though you fall behind
You'll be the one who walks the line-standing tall
They're so fragile, but they always find you when you hide...


[Chorus]

Cause your a broken man in a broken land
And don't they wish they were blessed like you


[Verse]

The struggle in side of your mind is a waste of time
Purest thoughts evaporate
Dark clouds reveal how you feel in your idle time
Your own tail becomes the bait
You don't even know even though your blood flows
Destroy yourself, your the one you hate-standing tall
They're so fragile, but they always catch you when you're late...


[Chorus]

Cause your a broken man in a broken land
And don't they wish they were blessed like you


[Bridge]

Standing tall they look so small with your world up their shoulders
But a broken man on broken land looks far beyond his bothers...

Break for the sun your the one, the chosen one,
Your time is up yor time is due
Craked like a whip from the hand of a broken man
To find out that he's just like you
But you've seen it all in your mind,
You've seen it all you built it up and they made it fall
Because your killing yourself-your so fragile,
But they cannot crush you if you don't crawl..

Now I'm a broken man in a broken land
Now I'm a broken man in a broken land...

And don't they wish they were blessed like you
And don't they wish they were blessed like you
And don't they wish they were blessed like you
And don't they wish they were blessed like you
And don't they wish they were blessed like you
And don't they wish they were blessed like you

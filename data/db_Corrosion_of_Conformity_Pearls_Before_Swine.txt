    Corrosion of Conformity
    "Pearls Before Swine"
    off of "Deliverance"
    
    Drop D tuning (like just about every CoC song there is)
    
    This is the main bass line.  If the bass does anything other than follow 
    the chord pro. during the chorus, I can't tell!  :)
    
    It's not at all difficult but nobody else did it, so...

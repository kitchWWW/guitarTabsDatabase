Artist: Courtney Barnett
Song: Elevator Operator
Genre: 
Key: 


Courtney plays with Pick and cappo on the 4th fret. Also, she ofter only used the top 3 strings of the chords,
but sometimes hits that 4th string for some extra expression. It's rhythm guitar and often people advise using
palm muting, but I think it is more fun to just play around with when you mute, this is certainly the way 
to reach the loose playing style Courtney is known for. 

The basic chords are E    (without the middlefinger or the fourth) and A   , and once in a while the pinky is 
used to add the minor 6th to the mix.

(Partial) Strumming pattern = Down strokes on the whole beat and up strokes on the last two half beats. 
(So down - down - down up down up) - but ofcourse this isn't kept up the whole time.

Remember this can be played extremely loose. You don't have to do 3 strings and can choose when to mute and 
when to let it ring

I think the fast up down strokes are triplets, but you'll get the rythm by listning to the song or my sources

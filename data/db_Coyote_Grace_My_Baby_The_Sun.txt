My Baby The Sun
(Joe Stevens)
Originally recorded on Now Take Flight

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Build me a boat deep in your heart,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
On the currents of your soul, I will row, I will chart[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]  
My journey will be, this story my own[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
As we wander side by side into the great unknown[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]  
Throw me a bone, cast me a line[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
Light my cigarette and I will open your bottle of wine[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
But I won't taste a drop, won't make a scene[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
I will live my life on the edge of that gorgeous ravine[/tab]


CHORUS:
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
But oh, would it be to hold the sun?[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
Oh, it aint me, your light shines down on everyone[/tab]



Sing me a tune about me and you 
Sing of the holy road and the phases of the Aries moon
But don't string me along, don't shelter me where I stand
Yeah, I know what it's like to be the one with the hammer in your hand

CHORUS:
But oh, would it be to hold the sun?
Oh, it aint me, your light shines down on everyone
My baby the sun

So, build me a boat deep in your heart
Hold me there forever more, long after we part
'Cause I'm reading the birds, walking a line
You will live in me, my darlin', till the end of time

CHORUS:
But oh, would it be to hold the sun?
Oh, it aint me, your light shines down on everyone
My baby the sun

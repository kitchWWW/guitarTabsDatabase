verse1
REGRET, WITH HOW I WAS TREATED
ALTHOUGH IT'S DESEARVED
I WAS COCKY WITH HOW I WAS LAYING BACK
FOR YOU TO OBSERVE
I HAD RUINED AN ALMOST PERFECT NIGHT
ONR THAT I HAD WISHED
NOW ITS GONE I CANT STREIGHTEN IT OUT
DONT WANT OT EXIST
bridge
SHELTERED FROM THE RAIN
WISH I WAS BACK IN SPAIN
AGAIN
chorus
OH, OH TO SLEEP
I CANT STAY HERE WITH ME
I WONT LEAVE UNTIL I SUCCEED
OH, WHILE YOU SLEEP
YOU HELD YOUR TRUST WITH ME
AND MY FAILING WAS MY GREED
verse2
TRESSPASS WAS WHEN I SAW YOU FIRST
YOU DIDNT CATCH MY EYE
I WAS DRUNK AND STUPID WITH WHAT I DID
I ESCAPED THAT TIME
THE BEACH RELAXED TO TWO OF US
OTHERS DISCUSSED MY WAYS
THERE WAS DISCUST ABOUT MY WAY OF LIFE
OR JUST MY LAYS
bridge
chorus
middle8
BUT THEN I SAW YOU OUT THAT NIGHT
AND I FOCUSSED IN ON YOU SHADED EYES
YOU TURNED ME ON TOO MUCH I COULDNT LET IT LIE
verse3
BUT NOW I KNOW WHAT I DID WRONG
WEVE GONE OUR SEPERATE WAYS
AND LEFT ALONE IN MY CARAVAN
WITH MY MEMORIES
THERES STILL THE CHANCE OF CONTACT
BUT SHOULD I SEASE
AND LEAVE IT TO THOSE WITH REPUTATIONS
STILL IN ONE PEACE
bridge
chorus

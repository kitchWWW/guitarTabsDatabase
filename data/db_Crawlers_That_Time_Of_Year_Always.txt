Key: 


[Verse]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Can you take me from the ghost[/tab]

That reside in this house?
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
They’re wearing your clothes[/tab]

And they’re starting to get loud
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
It’s just time of year always (Always, always)[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
I feel it in my collarbone, it’s where I start[/tab]
ache
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
But there’s comfort the the sadness[/tab]

And the mess I seem to make
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
But I can’t explain[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
It’s just that time of year again[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
No one's gonna miss you like I do[/tab]

But it's too late to know now
[tab]Em.              [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
No one's gonna know you like I do[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
You're always on my mind…[/tab]

My mind

[Verse]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Sold my morals for a smoke[/tab]

Somewhere in L.A.​
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
Asking strangers for their star signs[/tab]

And they think that it's foreplay
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
But it's hard to explain[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Has it been this way always? (Always, always)[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
You know my body more than most[/tab]

But we only talk in tongues
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
I need a conversation[/tab]

But you suck the air from my lungs
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
No leaves under my feet[/tab]

It's that time of year always
(Always, always, always)

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
No one's gonna miss you like I do[/tab]

But it's too late to know now
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
No one's gonna miss me like I do[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
You're always on my mind…[/tab]

My mind

post chorus
[tab][ch]D[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
…My mind…[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
My mind[/tab]

[Instrumental]
[ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
[ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]

[Bridge]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
It's you, you, you[/tab]

You're on my mind
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]
You, you, you[/tab]

All the time
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
You, you, you[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
You're on my mind[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]
It's you (You), you (You), you (You)[/tab]

You're on my mind
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
You (You), you (You), you (You)[/tab]

All the time
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
You (You), you (You), you (You)[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
On my mind…[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
Laying in my childhood bedroom[/tab]

When it's getting warm again
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I'll keep on the heating[/tab]

So it stays back like then (Always)

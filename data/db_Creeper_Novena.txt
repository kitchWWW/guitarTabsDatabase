[Verse 1]

[tab]       [ch]Abm[/ch]                [ch]F#[/ch]
Humble moon, what now do I do?[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
A restaurants' plastic glass[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Eb[/ch]
At house party with your hip flask[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Abm[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]
Has he kept you precious like a locket?[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]
The pale night alive[/tab]
[tab]                                                        [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]F#[/ch]
Through your jeans tight, cigarette box outline in your pocket[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]             [ch]Abm[/ch]
We're in the bathroom[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F#[/ch]
And you perch on the sink[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]Eb[/ch]
I begin to infatuate, exasperate, resuscitate[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Abm[/ch]                        [ch]F#[/ch]
By day the cat sleeps, but at night how he moans[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Eb[/ch]
Through the window's perspex[/tab]
[tab]                                                     [ch]E[/ch]
We sit and talk about sex 'cause it's all we have in common[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F#[/ch]
Don't you know[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]
And it's youth[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Abm[/ch]
Ever fading youth[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]E[/ch]
Would you have lived differently if you had known[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F#[/ch]
This life was on loan?[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]             [ch]Abm[/ch]                   [ch]F#[/ch]
I recall the blue first night I met you[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]
Gaze through the passing time[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Eb[/ch]
Your hair was henna and wine[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Abm[/ch]          [ch]F#[/ch]
The contrast in what I dream and reality[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Eb[/ch]
Took you back from the club while your friends all did drugs[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]E[/ch]
We never spoke about love[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#[/ch]
Just mortality[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]
And it's youth[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Abm[/ch]
Ever fading youth[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]E[/ch]
Would you have lived differently if you had known[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F#[/ch]
This life was on loan?[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]
And it's youth[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Abm[/ch]
Ever fading youth[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]E[/ch]
Would you have lived differently if you had known[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F#[/ch]
This life was on loan?[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab] [ch]B[/ch]
All of these nights you just trawl the same streets[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Abm[/ch]
Tell the same stories, you count the heart beats[/tab]
[tab] [ch]E[/ch]
Obsess with the death of the miracle days[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#[/ch]
I can feel all your dreams start to flicker and fade[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]
And it's youth[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Abm[/ch]
Ever fading youth[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]E[/ch]
Would you have lived differently if you had known[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F#[/ch]
This life was on loan?[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]

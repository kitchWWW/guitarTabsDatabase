 We people who are darker than blue,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C#m7[/ch]
Are we gonna stand around this town[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F#m7[/ch]
And let what others say come true?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#m7[/ch]                  [ch]G#m7[/ch]
We're just good for nothing they all figure,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m7[/ch]
 A boyish, grown-up, shiftless jigger.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m7[/ch]                           [ch]G#m7[/ch]
 Now we can't hardly stand for that,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m7[/ch]
 Or is that really where it's at?[/tab]

[tab][ch]C#m7[/ch]               [ch]F#m7[/ch]
 We people who are darker than blue,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#m7[/ch]
This ain't no time for segregating[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F#m7[/ch]
I'm talking 'bout brown and yellow two.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C#m7[/ch]                   [ch]G#m7[/ch]
High yellow girl, can't you tell[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#m7[/ch]
You're just the surface of our dark deep well?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m7[/ch]                       [ch]G#m7[/ch]
 If your mind could really see[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m7[/ch]
You'd know your colour the same as me.[/tab]

[tab][ch]C#m7[/ch]    [ch]F#m7[/ch]            [ch]C#m7[/ch]               [ch]F#m9[/ch]
 Pardon me, brother, as you stand in your glory,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m7[/ch]              [ch]F#m7[/ch]      [ch]C#m7[/ch]           [ch]F#m9[/ch]
 I know you won't mind if I tell the whole story.[/tab]

[tab][ch]C#m7[/ch]
Get yourself together, learn to know your side.[/tab]

Shall we commit our own genocide before you check out your mind?

I know we've all got problems, that's why I'm here to say,

Keep peace with me and I with you, let me love in my own way.

 Now I know we have great respect[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#m7[/ch]                         [ch]F#m7[/ch]
For the sister, and mother it's even better yet.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C#m7[/ch]                    [ch]G#m7[/ch]
But there's the joker in the street[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F#m7[/ch]
Loving one brother and killing the other.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m7[/ch]                            [ch]G#m7[/ch]
 When the time comes and we are really free[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m7[/ch]
There'll be no brothers left you see.[/tab]

[tab][ch]C#m7[/ch]               [ch]F#m7[/ch]
 We people who are darker than blue,[/tab]
[tab]`     [ch]C#m7[/ch]
Don't let us hang around this town[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F#m7[/ch]
And let what others say come true.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#m7[/ch]                      [ch]G#m7[/ch]

 Pardon me, brother, while you stand in your glory,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m7[/ch]              [ch]F#m7[/ch]    [ch]C#m7[/ch]             [ch]F#m9[/ch]

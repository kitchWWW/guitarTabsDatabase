MY DEAD SELF AGAIN (Cygnets) Revised 2023

[Verse]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
May may maybe I won’t wake up One Sad Sad Saturday morning[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                                          [ch]D[/ch]
I’ll be tried tried tried by a distant god For the lies that I uttered before him[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                                           [ch]D[/ch]
I feel that my vision of my life is strange I feel that my body is my soul’s cage[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
I hurt myself to release my rage And I’m the anti-christ?[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
I woke woke woke up and shot myself One sad sad Saturday morning[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
I failed failed failed by a lucid god I came back to life to adore him[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
My soul cries out as I set her free I hear her voice come from within me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
She says I’m him but how can I be If I’m the anti-christ?[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
So may may maybe I’ll wake him up One sad sad Saturday morning[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch] 
And cry cry “Christ is a dismal god” And claim I must have come long before him[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
I miss miss miss misery in me I hold onto life as if it’s the key[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
And his his history is a dream Awake the anti-christ[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Just as I’d gone She became the face I’d drawn[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
I lost my dream of you I thought these things I can’t undo[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
I made the mistake of holding you close to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
The sky is lost in a million miles I lost myself when I was a child[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
So I am a ghost And the door to life is closed[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
I left you in another time I lost you on that morning[/tab]
[ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

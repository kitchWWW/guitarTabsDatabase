[ch]G[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch]

[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
If i told you that I loved you,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Dm[/ch]
would I be saying something you don't know?[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
And if I showed you just how lovely you are[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]
would you believe me?[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
Well, I hope you would.[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Dm[/ch]
Well, I hope you would.[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
'Cause I've got hopes and dreams, and big machines[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
and days so bright they'll make you sing;[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]
They'll make you sing along[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]
And when we're standing there, the two of us,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
we'll see the question marks are all gone.[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Like a bandit in a small town[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G4[/ch]
who decides to use a small toy gun[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
He isn't ready to move with violence[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                                          [ch]Dm[/ch]
he just finds himself when he finds himself on the run.[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
'Cause he's got hopes and dreams, and big machines[/tab]
and days so bright they'll make you sing;
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
They'll make you sing along.[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
When we're standing there the two of us[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
we'll see the question marks are all gone.[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
They're all gone.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
They're all gone.[/tab]



I found the song as the backtrack to a youtube video. So far it hasn't gotten big 
enough for me to find any other chords, tabs or lyrics to it. I also can't find it 
as a standalone video on youtube. Good luck.

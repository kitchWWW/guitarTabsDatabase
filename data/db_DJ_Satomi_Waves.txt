Intro
[ch]Am[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] x2

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Like a rush on the beach [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
At the end of the day [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]
When the sand is going to be cold under your way [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
The season fades [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]Em[/ch]    
And you think everything's lost in the waves [/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Like a spark in your eyes [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
So your love will be mine [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
When the sky is going to light and shine [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
You take my hands [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                           [ch]Em[/ch]
And I think that time will give me one more chance [/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Do you remember [/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
A kiss under the moonlight [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
When it was summer [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]
It was love at first sight [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Can you remember [/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Cause I feel the same now [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
Until the winter [/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]
Will see blooming this love [/tab]


[Repeat intro]


[Chords are the same for the rest of the song]


Like a dive in the waves 
I am caught in you love 
And I'm flying in the clouds above 
I feel you near 
And I fear no more the winter 'cause you're here 

Do you remember 
A kiss under the moonlight 
When it was summer 
It was love at first sight 
Can you remember 
Cause I feel the same now 
Until the winter 
Will see blooming this love

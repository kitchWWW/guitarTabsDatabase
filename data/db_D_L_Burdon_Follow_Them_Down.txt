I was feeling as instinctive as a kicked dog[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
It was always God's plan just to turn a blind eye[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A7[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
Take this enmity as a warning shot[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Take this disappointment as proof of life[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
If they said he could fly, would you follow?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
If they claimed he would sink, would you follow them down?[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
Burning like a chemical reaction[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
Repeatedly recording the same results[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]A7[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
The gullible are still impressed[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Now replicate it in an uncontrolled space[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
If they said he could fly, would you follow?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
If they claim–µd he would sink, would you follow them down?[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Follow them down, follow them down[/tab]

[Middle 8]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
When the things that you need[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
And the things you want to leave[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]
Intersect with expectations[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Of modernity and belief[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
You get presented with these warring factions[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
One of vitriol the other of inaction[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]
The age of reason sits blood on its knees[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
While humanity sits with its cock in its hand in the age of technology[/tab]

[Bridge]
[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
If they said he could fly, would you follow?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]            [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Follow them down, follow them down[/tab]

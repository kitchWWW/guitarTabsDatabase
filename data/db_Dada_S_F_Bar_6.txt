This is a very rough version, with only basic chords.

Verse:
[ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch](?)  [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]C(9)[/ch]

the Em(?) chord is 020000.  I just don't know the name of this chord.

Chorus:
[ch]D[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch](4)  [ch]C[/ch](?)  [ch]C[/ch](9)  [ch]Em[/ch]

move the bass note around on the Em in the chorus to make it sound better.
I don't know the names of all these chords, but i play the Em progression as
022000   2x2000   3x2000   x02000

the [ch]C[/ch](?) chord is x32030.

Chords:
-------
[ch]Em[/ch]     022000
[ch]D[/ch]      xx0232
[ch]C(9)[/ch]   x32033
[ch]D[/ch](4)   xx0233

Lyrics:
-------

Long lean piece of ice
Thin and hard think what it will do
I can slice and I will pour it to you
Drip drop drip
Reflective properties, I see you
My mind stops and stutters
My mind stops
Please can I kiss your kneecaps?

Sun burns itself out

I look around and notice all the dogs
In line to howl so loud so long
For just one night
What the hell is your name?

I'm numb, dumbed down
On a leash that chokes so hard
My life fades to blue

And the hand that holds my leash
Is so strong that it's useless to struggle
Useless to catch the one breath that starts me down
To freedom
Unknown to the bone
Without taste, past disgrace
White pasty face
Please don't notice me my goddess

You'll have to play with the rhythm a little 'till it sounds right.
Cranck up your CD and play around with it.

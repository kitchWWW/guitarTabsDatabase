[Intro]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Why are you leaving?[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I'm not offended[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
My hands are still shaking[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Yesterday I leant you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Too many secrets[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I hope you forget 'em[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
I am relieved but I wish I knew you better[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Stared through all my sentences[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You hated when I cut my hair[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I don't know why I loved you at all[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Always animosity[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
When I ask you to kiss me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I don't know why I kissed you in the first place[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Why did you waste all my time and then decide to love me?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Why did you waste all my time and then decide to love me?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I don't know why I loved you at all[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I don't know why I loved you at all[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I don't know why I kissed you in the first place[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
My hands are full of tiny spoons to feed your hungry ego[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And if I hold them my whole life, will you please let me know[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Why you didn't care about me when I liked you back?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Why you didn't care about me when I liked you back?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I don't know why I loved you at all[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I don't know why I loved you at all[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I don't know why I kissed you in the first place[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Have a heart, have a heart, have a heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm7[/ch]
Sixteen six six six and I know the part[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
You are the river flow and we can never know[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm7[/ch]
We're just a weatherman, you make the wind blow[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Keep thinking 'bout every straight face yes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm7[/ch]
Wonder what your boyfriend thinks about your braces[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
What about them, I'm all about them[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm7[/ch]
Six such straight As, cut 'em in the bathroom[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
So this is it then, you're here to win friend[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm7[/ch]
Click click, saddle up, see you on the moon then[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
You're all alone friend, pick up the phone then[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm7[/ch]
Ring ring, call 'em up, tell 'em 'bout the new trends[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Have a heart, have a heart, have a heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm7[/ch]
Sixteen six six six and you fell apart[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
We form a tarot pack and I'm aware of that[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm7[/ch]
But we could fist fight drunk like the parent trap[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Keep thinking 'bout every straight face yes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm7[/ch]
Wonder what your boyfriend thinks about your braces[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
We never blink see and you can see me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm7[/ch]
We fell asleep in the middle of the fury[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
So this is it then, you're here to win friend[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm7[/ch]
Click click, saddle up, see you on the moon then[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
You're all alone friend, pick up the phone then[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm7[/ch]
Ring ring, call 'em up, tell 'em 'bout the new trends[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
So this is it then, you're here to win friend[/tab]

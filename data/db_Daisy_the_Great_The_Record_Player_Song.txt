[Intro]
[ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
I've got a record player that was made in 2014[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
Died my hair blue, it came out a seasick sort of green[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
I like vintage dresses when they fall just below my knees[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
I pretend I scraped them climbing in the trees[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]
Sometimes I think all I'm ever doing is, (trees)[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
Trying to convince myself I'm alive (trees)[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
Sometimes I think all I'm ever doing is, (trees)[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
Trying to convince myself I'm alive (trees)[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
Wipe my eyes and cut me off[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]
(Wipe my eyes I'm crying)[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]A[/ch]
I'm just crying for attention[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
(For attention)[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
I wish I'd been a teenage rebel[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
(Teenage rebel)[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Never even got detention[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
I don't really love you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
I just said that for a change of pace[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
I'm sorry, sometimes I don't recognize my face[/tab]

[Chorus]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I need a dictionary[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]
Someone look me up and define me[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]
Please remind me[/tab]
[tab]                                               [ch]A[/ch]
Who I'm supposed to be around you so you will do what I want you to[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
I'm always winning the wrong game[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
I don't remember my real name[/tab]

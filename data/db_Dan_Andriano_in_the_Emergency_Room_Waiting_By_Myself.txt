[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
We had a little chat, train stops and some weather[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Something 'bout a shopping list, then she got up and left[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
I'm happy just the same[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Bm[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
That ain't really why I came[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]  (into intro x2)
No I'm just fine, waiting by myself[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
A couple raindrops later, and the wind was picking up some jets[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
He said, "Hey man, I'm just one block down,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Won't you come and warm yourself?"[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
I said is everyone so nice?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Bm[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
But don't bother asking twice[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
No I'm alright just waiting here all wet[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
And I'm lonely, but that's alright with me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
And I'm tired, but hell I'll always be[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
And my savior done abandoned me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
But she kissed me once, and that's all I need[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
To live off of her memory[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Said she'd come back after she tamed the Wild West[/tab]
A                               D (into intro x2)
So I'm right here, waiting by myself

[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
Turned my pockets inside out on the counter top at ABC[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Think I'm set to keep me wet for a few more days at least[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
If you got something to eat,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Bm[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
Oh, that's really all I need[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
To wait right here, til she come back for me[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
See I'm lonely, but that's alright with me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
And I'm tired, but hell I'll always be[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
And my savior done abandoned me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
She kissed me once, and that's all I'll need[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
To live off of her memory[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]Bm[/ch]
Yeah[/tab]

[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]Bm[/ch]
Look at all these things that I don't need[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
I'm happy just to sit, relax, and breathe[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]C#/A[/ch]  [ch]Bm[/ch]
All these people running by me smell like greed and hate[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
But I, just want to sit and wait[/tab]


[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]

A                               D (into intro x2)
So I'm right here, waiting by myself

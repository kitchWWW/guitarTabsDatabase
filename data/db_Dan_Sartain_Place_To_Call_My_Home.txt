[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             
I can feel the Earth is moving[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                              
I can hear the road is calling[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I can taste the leaves and pollen[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
Price of gas will soon be rising[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And on the way we'll find our home,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Find a place to be alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
All I wanted was to roam[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Find a place to call my..[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I can see the sky is falling[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
I can hear the music playing[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Taste the waste, the man is preaching[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
End is near but out of reach[/tab]


And on the way we'll find our home,
Find a place to be alone
All I wanted was to roam
Find a place to call my..


I can see that things are changing
I keep hearing something saying
"Can't you place the soft refrain
That something's wrong inside my brain"

But on the way we'll find our home,
Find a place to be alone
All I wanted was to roam
And find a place to call my home

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
All I wanted was to roam[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
All I wanted was to roam[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
All I wanted was to roam[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And find a place to call my home[/tab]

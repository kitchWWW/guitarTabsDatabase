“Pyramid” by Danny Scerbo
[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
It’s a bitter sweet thing that you left me when I needed you the most[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
But it wasn’t just me, I really think that you needed me, too[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
You have a cold heart! You left me when I needed you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (hey!)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You kicked me out like I meant nothing to you, just so you could say,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
“I’m right, you’re wrong, and you ain’t never ever gettin’ you’re way!”[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
You are a selfish brat! You left me when I needed you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh[/tab]


[Pre-chorus]

[tab]           [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]
And we are through, but I sure won’t miss seein’ you [/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
And all the terrible things you do[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
You might think I'm still angry but I'm not, I just hate you[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Woah! Oh! Oh! Don’t you know that what you did was wrong?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
Tryin’ to be something you are not[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Building a pyramid you’re on top[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
This is not at all what you have to do! You’re acting like a teenage dude![/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
Tryin’ to be something you are not[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Building a pyramid you’re on top[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
It’s a bitter sweet thing that you left me in the middle of a song[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I was shocked at first, but now I know that it was time to move along[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
You were acting funny after all[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Goodbye, goodbye, don’t call me back! (hey!)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
It’s too late now for any terrible excuses[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
The whole world knows now that you're just plain old abusive[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                                                [ch]G[/ch]                                         [ch]F[/ch]
So if I saw you all alone, I wouldn’t turn and moan, I’d flip my middle finger into your sight[/tab]
and spit into your eye like, “Who’d you think you are to ruin all our mem’ries and leave a nasty scar?”


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Woah! Oh! Oh! Don’t you know that what you did was wrong?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
Tryin’ to be something you are not[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Building a pyramid you’re on top[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
This is not at all what you have to do! You’re acting like a teenage dude![/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
Tryin’ to be something you are not[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]

[Bridge]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Just when I thought that you would support me[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]

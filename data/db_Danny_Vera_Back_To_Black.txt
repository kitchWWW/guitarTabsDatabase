[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
  She left no time to regret,[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]E7[/ch]
kept the pussy wet with her same old safe bet[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
and   me kept my head,[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]E7[/ch]
high my tears went   dry to get on without my   wife.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]Dm[/ch]
And   you went back to what you knew,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]E7[/ch]
so far removed from all the shit that we went   through.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]Dm[/ch]
And   I tread a troubled   track,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]E7[/ch]
my odds are stacked and I'll go back   to black.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]Dm[/ch]
  We only said good-bye with words I died a hundred times,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]E7[/ch]
  now you go back to him and I go back to [Verse 2] us.[/tab]

[Verse 2]

[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]E7[/ch]
it's not enough that you love blow and I love puff.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]Dm[/ch]
And   life is like a   pipe[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]E7[/ch]
and I'm a big fat dollar rolling up the walls inside.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]Dm[/ch]

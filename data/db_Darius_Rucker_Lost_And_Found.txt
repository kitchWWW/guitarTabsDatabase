[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Always wanted to be someone else[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
It always seemed to me the way to be[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Cadd9[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
A name in my life seemed to be less[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
I've changed it so many times I forget[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Was the man at the Century Cafe says[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Stop fooling yourself like I once did[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
I was store once yes, indeed[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
When I forgot just who I was[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
People asking for too much[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Till I couldn't tell for sure[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Said there's a man sleeping it off in the alleyway[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Sleep beneath the [?] winter's day[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Make her stomach turn and she runs away[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Calls up a homeless man and hasn't run off[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]
What she don't understand is he was once in your shoes[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch]
Thinking like no one does, how you never lose[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
Slowly slipping, inching towards the booth[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
He's just another man you've seen[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
No different from you and me[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
Just misplaced a dream or two[/tab]


[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Not everyone was born with a golden crust[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
So if you don't give a helping hand do me this much[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
[?] being with your friends[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause you might just be lying there in the end[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
This is what the old man said[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Day before he met the dead[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
Lost and found and lost again[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
He was lost and found and lost again[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
He was lost and found and lost again[/tab]

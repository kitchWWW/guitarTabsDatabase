[Verse 1]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
She was found in her bedroom with a note on the wall[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
Saying take me or leave me, it don't matter now at all[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Her passing made the papers though there weren't much to say[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]
Just a girl of the night takes her life at midday[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
She was fond of the ladies and good to the men[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]
And she could take you 'bout anywhere that you'd never been[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Though I never touched her we'd walk every day[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Heading west down Sunset talking our lives away[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
Said she could walk on the waterbed, shoot out the lights[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
Take you up to the limits, push you over the line[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Bm7[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]
Said if you wanna see God, brother, close your eyes...[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
This one's for Rhonda's last ride[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
There's a town in Nevada, just across the state line[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Where Rhonda grew up ahead of her time[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Why, if I had to say, it's her daddy to blame[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Old desert rat Cody set her childhood to flame[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
And there were GI's and truckers and ghosts of the road[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
On their way up to Vegas they'd lighten their load[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Yeah there was many a lover but nary complained[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
And it was many a man who'd call out her name[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]

[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Take you up to the limits, push you over the line[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]Bm7[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]
Said if you wanna see God, brother, close your eyes...[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
This one's for Rhonda's last ride[/tab]


[Verse 5]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
I'm not here to tell you she died out of shame[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]
In her last chosen moment, her lips cursed no name[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Not Cody nor Jesus, not a cry out for love[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
She told me to tell you that leaving's enough[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]

Take you up to the limits, push you over the line[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]

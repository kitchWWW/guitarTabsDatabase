[INTRO]
[ch]D[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]

[VERSE 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I was too dumb to notice[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
That there's something about you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch] 
What am I supposed to do?[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
I sure wish I knew[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]A[/ch]
All the butterflies I felt inside never really mattered[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                                      [ch]Em[/ch]
Wishful thoughts and sudden smiles end up being shattered[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
What are we supposed to be?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]                  
I'm hopelessly addicted to you[/tab]

But you never felt the same

[CHORUS 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Time may pass us by[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
But you'll stay stuck on my mind[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]Bm[/ch]
And that moment we stared that night[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
I thought it was right[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
But maybe I was wrong all along[/tab]

[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
I held onto something that never really mattered[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
Stuck on that starting line[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]    [ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch] - [ch]D[/ch] - [ch]Bm[/ch] - [ch]G[/ch] - [ch]A[/ch]
I'm still silently, quietly hoping you'll end up with me[/tab]

[VERSE 2]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
I was too dumb to notice[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
There was something about you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]    
How I used supposed to see things?[/tab]
               
If only you knew

[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]A[/ch]
All the times we were together I never really mattered[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                                         [ch]D[/ch]
All you see is what you want my heart is being shattered[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
What are we supposed to be?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]                  
I'm helplessly addicted to you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
But you never felt the same[/tab]

[ENDING VERSE](play once for every chord)
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]  
I was too dumb to notice[/tab]

I'm still stuck on you?[/tab]

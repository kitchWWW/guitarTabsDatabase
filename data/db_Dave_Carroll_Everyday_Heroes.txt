[Intro] 
[ch]E[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Fire fighters at the station listen as the tone goes out[/tab]

Fire alarms activated and building is showing smoke
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
And so the Engine rolls to trouble again[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
There's people at the scene just watchin'[/tab]

People running out for their lives

The fire fighters get there and help them out

And go looking for more inside
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
Cause that's just what they do, these women and men[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
Cause they made a promise and here they come[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]
Someone hurtin' called 9-1-1[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
And the siren's saying hope is on the way[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]A/E[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]
There's a hero racing to help a stranger today[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Saturday night in the city, the cruiser gets a dispatched call[/tab]

A little girl says her daddies mad

And drank a bunch of alcohol
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
And so they head away, into trouble again[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
The people at the house are screaming[/tab]

And someone yells: " he's got a gun"

A little girl full of panic cries out: " Daddy don't you
shoot my mom"
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
And that's where the cops come in[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]
These women and men[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
Cause they made a promise and here they come[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]
Someone hurtin' called 9-1-1[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
And the siren's saying hope is on the way[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]A/E[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]E/G#[/ch]
There's a hero racing to help a stranger today[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
When people in the world need savin'[/tab]

The saviors who answer the call
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]
Don't get paid anymore for danger[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]E/G#[/ch]
Or get to pick the one's they want[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
They just go to where the few will go[/tab]

To maybe lay it all on the line
[tab]        [ch]B[/ch]                    [ch]C#m[/ch]
As they do their job, do it one more time[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
Cause they made a promise and here they come[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]
Someone hurtin' called 9-1-1[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
And the siren's saying hope is on the way[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]

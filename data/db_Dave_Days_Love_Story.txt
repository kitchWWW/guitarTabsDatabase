[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
We were both young when I first saw you[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]
I close my eyes and the flashback starts[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
You see me make mjy way through the crowd[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
And say, "Hello"[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
Little did you know[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
That I was Romeo, and I was throwing pebbles[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
And your daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
And you were crying on the staircase[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
Begging me please don't go, and you said[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]
I'll be the prince and you'll be the princess[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
It's a love story baby just say "yes"[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]
So close your eyes[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Escape this town for a little while[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause I was Romeo, you were a scarlet letter[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
And your daddy said stay away from Juliet[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]
But you were everything to me and you were[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
Begging me please don't go, and you said[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I'll be the prince and you'll be the princess[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
It's a love story baby just say yes[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Juliet, save me, they try to tell me how to feel[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
This love is difficult, but it's real,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
It's a love story baby just say yes, oh[/tab]

[Solo]
[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

[Bridge]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
My faith in you is fading[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
When I met you on the outskirts of town and you said[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I keep waiting for you but you never come[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Then I knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Marry me, Juliet you'll never have to be alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I love you, and that's all I really know[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bm[/ch]
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
It's a love story baby just say yes[/tab]

I want to tell you, about my power, about my mysterious kink  [/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]  
I used to go about,  fully believing, I was invisible[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]       
The legendary, invisible rock singer, I would open my mouth and spew forth[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]  
No blues, no news, just hey mate, yeah you![/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]
Over here, boo!   Just for a moment, I would materialise[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]             
Anyway, people started to talk, started to talk about this, legendary mysterious[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]                                            [ch]D[/ch]           
Loud mouth invisible rock singer cowboy, I began to act cool, come back[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]                             
Materialise,  even though I wasn?t meaning to,  people began to come[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]   
And see this invisible loud mouth rock singer cowboy, aaah, you know soon[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]D[/ch]              
People would sit behind me at cafes, and say he thinks he?s invisible watch[/tab]
  C    [hold]           
Jees you know I hate to keep em waiting I tried my best I got quite upset
[tab]                         [ch]Em[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]         
Then I thought, ahh it?s not such a bad thing, to be seen as a guy who [/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]           
Thinks he can?t be seen, even though I know I can, it?s quite a trip[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]    
I mean in certain circumstances certain places, anything goes if you're known[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                      [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
If you?ve got a name around town as a guy who?ll do anything if nobody?s looking[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]   
But if any body?s looking, ?cause they think he thinks he can?t be seen[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]    
I mean they stare,  like they think I can?t see em, it?s like I?m blind[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch] 
Like I?m invisible, ah you know soon[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch] 
Everybody?s looking, because they think I think nobody?s looking  [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
So I can?t not be seen so I?m not looking at them, I know exactly where they are[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]                                       [ch]D[/ch]                      
And even if I was they couldn?t see me because they?re too busy waiting for me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]  
To dematerialise right there in front of them,  actually, what a place to hide[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]            
I mean say you were a spy, an undercover man, somebody on the run, what better[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]Em[/ch]
Place to disappear, what a cover, a lead singer in a rock and roll band[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]Em[/ch]
You?re poor, you?re stoned, you?re a slave to a unnameable half forgotten ambition[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
You?re just another guy on the lost highway, a ramblin? man, a pirate of love[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]  
A rider on the range, a seventh son of a seventh son, a love rustler, a desperado[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]                              
A bastard right royal, entitled to be bad,  the man in black,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]       
John the conqueroo, the worlds forgotten boy, meat man Mr blues, the velvet fog[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]    
The silver fox, the little cloud that cried, the best dressed chicken in town[/tab]

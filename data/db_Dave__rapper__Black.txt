It's workin' twice as hard as the people you know you're better than[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                     [ch]A[/ch]
'Cause you need to do double what they do so you can level them[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Tell us we used to be barbaric, we had actual queens[/tab]

Black is watchin' child soldiers gettin' killed by other children[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]
Feelin' sick, like, "Oh shit, this could have happened to me"[/tab]

Your mummy watchin' tellin' stories 'bout your dad and your niece[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
A kid dies, the blacker the killer, the sweeter the news[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
And if he's white you give him a chance, he's ill and confused[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
If he's black he's probably armed, you see him and shoot[/tab]

'Cause black is in your blood, and you ain't even got the heart to stop[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Black is steppin' in for your mother because your father's gone[/tab]

Tryna help a lady cross the road to have her walkin' off[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Black is growin' up around your family and makin' it[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Then being forced to leave the place you love because there's hate in it[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]
People say you fake the shit, never stayed to change the shit[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
But black is bein' jealous, you'd be dead if you had stayed in it[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]
Black is strugglin' to find your history or trace the shit[/tab]

You don't know the truth about your race 'cause they erasin' it[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Black has got a sour fuckin' flavour, here's a taste of it[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]
'Cause you got 20 cousins in your country living stress-free[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Walkin' for their water, daughter wrapped inside a bed sheet[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Black is distant, it's representin' countries that never even existed while your grandmother was livin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]

Loud in our laughter, silent in our sufferin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]
Black is bein' strong inside and facing defeat[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Poverty made me a beast, I battled the law in the streets[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
We all struggled, but your struggle ain't a struggle like me[/tab]

Well how could it be when your people gave us the odds that we beat?
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
I mean, fuckin' hell, what about our brothers that are stuck in jail?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
That couldn't bust a bell, they held a bird and gotta live with it[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]
Black is bein' guilty until proven that you're innocent[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Black is sayin', "Free my fucking niggas stuck inside in prison cells"[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]
They think it's funny, we ain't got nothin' to say to them[/tab]

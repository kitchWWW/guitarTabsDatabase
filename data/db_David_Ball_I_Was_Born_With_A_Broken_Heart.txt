[Verse]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
If you're lost, and you're alone  [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]
Let me sing you a song  [/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]B[/ch]
You're not the only lonely one tonight  [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
I can sympathize with you  [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
I know what you're goin' through  [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]
I've been walkin' in your shoes all my life.  [/tab]
  
[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I was born with a broken heart [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
Born to lose right from the start  [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]
Raised on hand-me-down blues  [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
That's why I sing the way I do  [/tab]
          
Sad six string and a jukebox voice  
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
I'm the lonely people's choice  [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]B[/ch]        
I was made to play the part  [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch] 
I was born with a broken heart. [/tab]
  
[Verse]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
If the sun, should ever shine, [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
In your life, well friend that's fine  [/tab]
[tab]                                                         [ch]B[/ch]
I hope you leave behind these troubled times that we've shared [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
Oh but don't look back for me  [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
I'm where I'm supposed to be[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]
As long as there's a lonely street, I'll be there.  [/tab]
  
[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I was born with a broken heart [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
Born to lose right from the start  [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]           
Raised on hand-me-down blues  [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
That's why I sing the way I do  [/tab]
          
Sad six string and a jukebox voice  
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
I'm the lonely people's choice  [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]B[/ch]        
I was made to play the part  [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch] 
I was born with a broken heart. [/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]
Yes I was made to play the part  [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]
I was born with a broken heart. [/tab]

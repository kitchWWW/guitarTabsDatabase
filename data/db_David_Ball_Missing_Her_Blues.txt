I got the missing her all day, heading for a heartache blues,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]                                             [ch]A[/ch]
I tell myself it's over but I know it's just no use,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
Cause I wake up every morning with the same old broken hearted,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A7[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Feeling that I just can't lose,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
It's those missing her all day, every day, in more ways,[/tab]

Heading for a heartache blues,[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Goodbye note that's all she left,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]
And poor me all by myself,[/tab]

Sun comes up the same old thing,[/tab]

Ain't no doubt what the day will bring,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Walking the floor and calling her name,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]
The sun goes down, I start all over again,[/tab]

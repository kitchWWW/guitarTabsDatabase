Artist: David Bazan
Song: Both Hands Over My Eyes
Genre: 
Key: 


Standard tuning:
When Bazan plays this at house shows, he plays with a capo on the 2nd fret and he starts it off with a 
pretty funky chord which an online chord detector recognized as G6(#11), this chord may not sound right to you
at first but go check out his performance of "Both Hands" for KEXP. It's right. Then it goes to good ol' A7.
Other chords to look out for include, but may not be limited to, Asus4, E7sus4, and a D major at the end of 
each chorus.

If I'm not losing sleep, I'm probably over it[/tab]
Might take a couple weeks for me to decide
[tab][ch]Asus4[/ch]                        [ch]E7sus4[/ch]              [ch]G6[/ch]        [ch]A7[/ch]   
Didn't think you'd take this long to make up the lost time[/tab]
Can't help wondering why it still feels like


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]G6[/ch]          [ch]A7[/ch]       [ch]G6[/ch]
Both hands over my eyes[/tab]
Both hands over my eyes
Both hands over my eyes
[tab][ch]G6[/ch]         [ch]A7[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]  
Both hands over my eyes[/tab]

(REST)

Sometimes twice a week, we make ourselves vulnerable[/tab]
We get a little peek over enemy lines
[tab][ch]Asus4[/ch]              [ch]E7sus4[/ch]              [ch]G6[/ch]        [ch]A7[/ch] 
Even as what weighs on me is bubbling over[/tab]
I understand I can't sweat what mystery hides


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]G6[/ch]          [ch]A7[/ch]       [ch]G6[/ch]
Both hands over my eyes[/tab]
Both hands over my eyes
Both hands over my eyes
[tab][ch]G6[/ch]         [ch]A7[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]  
Both hands over my eyes[/tab]

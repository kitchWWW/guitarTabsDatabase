Deny Myself
David Bazan

Verse 1
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
  My blood is moving     sacred as it spreads[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
  One man's temptation    is another's daily bread[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
  Overlook a little sin    or focus on the flaws[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
The law is for the body   not the body for the law[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
   In a minute I'll be swimming in what used to come for free[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
But now might fetch an ounce of flesh when it occurs to me[/tab]

Chorus
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I could deny myself    I could deny myself[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]Bm[/ch]
   I could deny myself[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
    But why would I deny myself   why would I deny myself[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
Why would I deny     myself[/tab]

Verse 2
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
 Divine light compelled us   last night when we were kids[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
But adults in the morning     lost light is all there is[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
   I cuckolded my brother coz I was bored and coz I could[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]
   I fell asleep in our lover's arms   and woke up in the woods[/tab]

Chorus

I could deny myself    I could deny myself[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]Bm[/ch]
   I could deny myself[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
    But why would I deny myself   why would I deny myself[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
Why would I deny     myself[/tab]

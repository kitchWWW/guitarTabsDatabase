youve heard the stories you know how it goes
once upon a garden we were lovers with no clothes
fresh from the soil we were beautiful and true
in control of our emotions until we ate the poison fruit

and now its hard to be hard to be
hard to be a decent human being


wait just a minute you expect me to believe
that all this misbehaving grew from one enchanted tree
and helpless to fight it we should all be satisfied
with this magical explanation for why the living die

and why its hard to be hard to be
hard to be a decent human being

childbirth is painful we toil to grow our food
ignorance made us hungry information made us no good
every burden misunderstood

so i swung my tassel to the left side of my cap
knowing after graduation there would be no going back
and no congratulations from my faithful family
some of whom are already fasting to intercede for me

because its hard to be hard to be
hard to be a decent human being
hard to be a decent human being

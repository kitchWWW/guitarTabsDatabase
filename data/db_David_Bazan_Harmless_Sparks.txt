Harmless Sparks

Capo 3

[ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]

They might have burned

        [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]

but the priests were all taking turns

        [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]

showing nuns what they had discerned

  [ch]Am/G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]

about their bodies in the dark

[ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]

they carried on

          [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]

from the evening until the dawn

           [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]Am/G[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]

like they should have been all along making harmless sparks

[ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]G7[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]

instead of breaking little boys' hearts

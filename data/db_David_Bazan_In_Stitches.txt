Artist: David Bazan
Song: In Stitches
Genre: 
Key: 


Hey all,
This is a really simple, really beautiful song to play. As in most Bazan songs, it's 
more by lyrics and vocal melody than by the guitar itself.  These lyrics are a little sad 
me as a Christian to hear, but it is beautiful nonetheless.

The song uses the following chords in the following order for its entirety:

[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Gm[/ch]* [ch]Dm[/ch]

During the verse:

[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
My body bangs and twitches[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]
Some brown liquor whets my tongue[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Gm[/ch]
My fingers find the stitches[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
Firmly back and forth they run[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
I need no other memory[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]
Of the bits of me I left[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Gm[/ch]
When all this lethal drinking[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Gm[/ch]*  [ch]Dm[/ch]
Is to hopefully forget about You[/tab]

I might as well admit it
Like I even have a choice
The crew have killed the captain
But they still can hear his voice
A shadow on the water
A whisper in the wind
On long walks with my daughter
Who is lately full of questions about You

When Job asked you the question,
You responde, "Who are you
to challenge your Creator?"
Well if that one part is true
It makes You sound defensive
like You had not thought it through
enough to have an answer
like you might have bit off more than you could chew

*The Gm can be barred during the verses as regular or you can use the Gm*; during the 
You.." part, Bazan does a pull off on the Gm and Dm that requires a unique Gm fingering

[ch]Gm[/ch]*: 3x0331 (from string 6 [ch]E[/ch] to string 1 [ch]E[/ch])

For both the Gm* and the Dm do a very simple 1p0 (that is, a pull off from 1 to 0) on 
first string. You can listen for the right rhythm and strumming. And there it is. Enjoy.

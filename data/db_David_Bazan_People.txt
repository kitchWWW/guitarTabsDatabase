Intro on [ch]A[/ch]

Verse Chords: [ch]B[/ch]/[ch]Dsus2[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]F#m[/ch]

When I was young
I saw people helping people all the time
Because you were
People-helping-people

In your prime
I thought people-loving-people
Were the norm
Because you were people
Loving people
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]/[ch]Dsus2[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]
Before the long dark storm[/tab]

CHORUS
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
But now you're selfish and mean[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]F#m[/ch]
Your eyes glued to a screen[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
And what titillates you[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]F#m[/ch]
Is depraved and obscene[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
And I know that it's dangerous to judge[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
But man you've gotta find the truth[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]F#m[/ch]
And when you find that truth don't budge[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
Until the truth you found begins to change[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#m[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
And it does I know, [/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I know[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
When you love the truth enough[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]F#m[/ch]
You start to tell all the time[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
When it gets you into trouble[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
You discover you don't mind[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
'Cause if good is finally gonna trump[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Than man you've gotta take stock[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]F#m[/ch]
And you've gotta take your lumps[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
Or else they trickle down[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]F#m[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Into someone else's cup below[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
You know[/tab]

[ch]D[/ch] - [ch]E[/ch] - [ch]A[/ch]

VERSE
I wanna know who are these people
Blaming their sins on the fall
Who are these people

If I'm honest with myself at all
These are my people
Man, what else can I say
You are my people
And we're the same in so many ways

CHORUS
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
Then your eyes turned green[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]F#m[/ch]
And you broke the machine[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
That when handed to you[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]F#m[/ch]
Was still kind of functioning[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
And I know that it's dangerous to judge[/tab]

But man you've gotta find the truth[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
When I woke up the next morning,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You looked right through me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Through your eyes crying,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I could finally see[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
They said, "please baby please"[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
They said, "please baby please"[/tab]

When I called you from Atlanta,
You refused to speak
Not three days sober,
Begging for a drink

And I said, "please baby please"
And I said, "please baby please"

(Bridge)
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]Dm[/ch]
Those two pairs of big blue eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Stare me down, watching me fall[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]Dm[/ch]
But what makes a man realize[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Csus7[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
That he's about to lose it all?[/tab]

(softer then building)
Elevator to ICU
Now our baby's twenty-three
She'd been out late drinking,
Killed a mother of three

And she said, "please daddy please"
And she said, "please daddy please"

I play it in all Barre chords except the C Csus7 Am change in the bridge

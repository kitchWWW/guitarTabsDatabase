Intro: [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                                         [ch]C[/ch]
With the threat of hell hanging over my head like a halo[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                           [ch]C[/ch]
I was made to believe in a couple of beautiful truths[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                                          [ch]C[/ch]
That eventually had the effect of completely unravelling[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]C7[/ch]
The powerful curse put on me by you[/tab]

Chorus
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
When you set the table[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]C7[/ch]
When you chose the scale[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Did you write a riddle[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]C7[/ch]
That you knew they would fail[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Did you make them tremble[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
So they would tell the tale[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                *       [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]C7[/ch]
Did you push us when we fell[/tab]

Verse Chords:
If my mother cries when I tell her what I have discovered
Then I hope she remembers she taught me to follow my heart
And if you bully her like you’ve done me with fear of damnation
Then I hope she can see you for what you are

Chorus Chords:
What am I afraid of
Whom did I betray
In what medieval kingdom does justice work that way
If you knew what would happen
And you made us just the same
Then you my Lord can take the blame

[Intro]
[ch]A[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]C#m[/ch]
[ch]B[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                                           [ch]C#m[/ch]
Maybe it's her perfume drifting through the air, makes your head spin out of control[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                                          [ch]B[/ch]
Perhaps its just the season, that could be the reason, you've never wanted her more[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                               [ch]C#m[/ch]
Maybe it's the sky, reflected in her eyes, well maybe it's that bottle of wine[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                                                     [ch]B[/ch]
It could have been that kiss, I wonder what it is, what's got you feeling so fine[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                       [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
Don't blame it on the cha cha cha, blame it on the moon[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]B[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]E7[/ch]
You can't just say it's just this magic night, well blame it on this tune[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]                                       [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]C#m[/ch]
Go on tell me it's the stars up above, you can't blame it on a thing called love[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]B[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]
It's not the band singing na-na-na, so don't blame it on the cha cha cha[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                             [ch]C#m[/ch]
Puente nai i paopao anai maggap gi aire, anai ma’nilik i lu’hu[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                                             [ch]B[/ch]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                           [ch]C#m[/ch]
Puente nai i aire, chetton gi matåmu, pat puente i buteyan minu[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]B[/ch]
Pat puente chiniku’ña, lao håfa neni enao, na sen magof hao nai pågu[/tab]

No it's not the rhythm, makes you move your feet, it's your heart now that's taking control[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                         [ch]B[/ch]

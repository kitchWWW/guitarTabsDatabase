[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
Well some people they claim[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
They never had a fair roll of the dice[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
They could be right[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
But that's not me, see I was lucky[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
And just had everything fall in my plate[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Call it fate if you want to[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
But for all the elaborate setup and maneuver[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]Dm[/ch]
Being wheeled into position to deliver some saccharine[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]A7[/ch]
Punch to the guts of a world screaming out[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
For whatever the hell they think it is that I've got[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
Every time I was given a chance[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
To stand on my own two feet[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Oh I fell, yah[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
And every time I was given a chance[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
To stand on my own two feet[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Oh I fell, yah[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
And every time opportunity knocks on my door[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Cm[/ch]
I just send it on straight down to hell[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
'cause every time I was given a chance[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
To stand on my own two feet I fell[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
Well some people they imagine[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]C[/ch]
The disappointment must tear me apart[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
Break my heart[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
And presume I'm disgusted[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
By all the injustice I've seen[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
But that's not me and I tell you[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
I bear no resentment to millionaire pop singers[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
Barely literate poets and guitar stock gunslingers[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
And I smile so politely[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
At the well-meaning ignorance[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Of the people who tell me I'm gonna make it someday[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
Every time I was given a chance[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
To stand on my own two feet[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Oh I fell, yah[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
And every time I was given a chance[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
To stand on my own two feet[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Oh I fell, yah[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
And every time opportunity knocks on my door[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Cm[/ch]
I just send it on straight down to hell[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
'cause every time I was given a chance[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
To stand on my own two feet I fell[/tab]

[Instrumental]
[ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Well the sun's going down on what's left of today[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                             [ch]D[/ch]
And the tide drags what's left of this moment away[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
And so I kick through the dirt and the red autumn leaves[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                            [ch]D[/ch]
What I had and what I lost and what I still believe[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
And I have no regrets for the time that I spent[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
Barely paying my dues and barely paying the rent[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
For a simple pursuit of more honest a life[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]D[/ch]
Yah I don't cheat on my taxes, I don't cheat on my wife[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Now the fire's burning out and the walls closing in[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
And I'm dragged by the gravity into the sin[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Of obedient service of some twisted machine[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
Blowing smoke in our faces of each little scene[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Set to form a distraction just to buy up some time[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
Misdirected by swagger and beaten by rhyme[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Telling tales of a life you might one day attain[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]D[/ch]
If you just keep your focus relentlessly trained[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
On the things you can get and not who you can be[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
No the innocent dream of the sky and the sea[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
And the word and the truth and the spirit of man[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
And a history that promises one day we can[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
With a love for your brother and your sister and yourself[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
Get there one day together in good cheer and good health[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
But it comes at a cost, yah there's a price that you pay[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]D[/ch]
For a sweet bowl tomorrow you gotta give up today[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]Em[/ch]
It's a sacrifice way beyond mortals like me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
For an age that never was and never could ever be[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
So I don't dwell on the past, I don't rue my mistakes[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
And I'm proud that I never had whatever it takes[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Now I'm stood on the deck of this leaky old boat[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
With just a shirt on my back and a song in my throat[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                                          [ch]Em[/ch]
And I'm the luckiest boy on the face of the earth[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause I know about love and I know what it's worth[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]Em[/ch]
So I'm not giving up, and I'm not giving in[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
Though I know it's a fight that I'm not gonna win[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
And I still scream in the face of more powerful men:[/tab]

I choose this, motherfucker, and I choose it again!


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
Every time I was given a chance[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
To stand on my own two feet[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Oh I fell, yah[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
And every time I was given a chance[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
To stand on my own two feet[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Oh I fell, yah[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
And every time opportunity knocks on my door[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Cm[/ch]
I just send it on straight down to hell[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
'cause every time I was given a chance to stand on my own two feet[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Yah every time I was given a chance to stand on my own two feet[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, every time I was given a chance to stand on my own two feet I fell[/tab]

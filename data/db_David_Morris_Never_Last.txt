[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Hey, I'm on this front porch just thinking 'bout you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Couple beers deep, I been drinking 'bout you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, I know sometimes people change[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
I just wish we stayed the same[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
How am I supposed to live without you?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Do you ever think about those times on those county lines?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Sneaking out your daddy's house early on a Friday night[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Do you ever think about the front seat of my truck?[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
When you and I were falling in love[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
And we were going fast[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
But good things never last[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
I want your feet on the dash on a barefoot summer night[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
With the radio loud and a fire in your eyеs[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
I wish we were going fast[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
But good things nеver last[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
We would ride around in this old town that raised us[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Just messing round and staying up[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
I wish we coulda stayed young, but[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Good things never last[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Good things never last[/tab]

[tab]                     [ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
When you think about me, baby, does it feel like a dream?[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Does it feel like a lifetime since we were seventeen?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
When we were in high school, homeroom, bleachers with no rules[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
Stealing all my hoodies, watching dodgeball and old school[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Yeah, you got me in my feels right now[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]Em[/ch]
I wish we was in them hills right now[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, just talking and driving round[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
 I'm talking 'bout[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

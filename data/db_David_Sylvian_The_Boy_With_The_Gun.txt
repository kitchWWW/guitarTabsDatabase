[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]B7[/ch]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
He knows well his wicked ways[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm7[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
A course of bitterness[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
A grudge held from his childhood days[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm7[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
As if life had loved him less[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Reading down his list of names[/tab]
He ticks them one by one
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                   [ch]Gm[/ch]
He points the barrel at the sky[/tab]
[tab][ch]Abmaj7[/ch]           [ch]Bbmaj7[/ch]
Firing shots off at the sun[/tab]

[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]B7[/ch] 
"I am the law and I am the King[/tab]
[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]B7[/ch] 
I am the wisdom, listen to me sing"[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
He carves out the victim's names[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm7[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
In the wooden butt of the gun[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
He leans well back agains the tree[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm7[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
He knows his Kingdom's come[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
He'll breath a sigh self satisfied[/tab]
The work is in good hands
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                  [ch]Gm[/ch]
He shoots the coins into the air[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Abmaj7[/ch]             [ch]Bbmaj7[/ch]
And follows where the money lands[/tab]
[ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch] 
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]B7[/ch]
"I am the law and I am the King[/tab]
[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]B7[/ch]
I am the wisdom, listen to me sing"[/tab]


He pauses at the city's edge
Of hellfire and of stone
He summons up the devil there
To give him courage of his own
He'll free the sinners of deceit
They'll hear his name and run
His justice is his own reward
Measured out beneath the sun
"I am the law and I am the King
I am the wisdom, listen to me sing"
And my name's on the gun
Work is just begun
The boy with the gun

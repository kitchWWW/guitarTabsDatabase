You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I could both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See my old man's got a problem
Lives with a bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
Body's too young for looking like his
Mama went off and left him
Wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
I quit school that's what I did
What I did, what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough that we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we're driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market in the checkout line
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a big house and live in the suburbs

So remember when we're driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job pays all our bills
Stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought we'd together you and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we're driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

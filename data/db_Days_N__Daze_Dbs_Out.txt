[Verse 1]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
"I wish we were leaving tomorrow," you'll say[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
And I really can't blame you[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause I hate to stay in the same place too long[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I swear it drives me insane[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
The smell of the air, the roads and the people[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
Become too familiar[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
No longer exciting to me[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
That’s annoying I just want to get away[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]Em[/ch]
The monotony is killing me it’s killing you So what to do[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
Jump in the car and drive away[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]D[/ch]
We'll worry about gasoline later[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
When we're broken down on interstate ten west[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]Em[/ch]
Cause I just cannot stand it here for any longer[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]C[/ch]
And I fear that if I stay for one more day[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
I'll fire bomb this fucking place[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
So I better go cause I don't want to go to jail[/tab]
Cause that place fucking sucks

[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]
And what if when we get back[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
To this town everything is different[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
All those familiar places[/tab]
We once loved no longer exist
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Well at least I'll still have you and you'll have me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
That's all we need[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I'm not saying that we're old[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
I just don't feel that we're still young[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
After all this time that we've been lost[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
So go for broke and fuck tomorrow[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]
Cheat and steal and beg and borrow[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Never even contemplate the cost[/tab]

[Bridge]
N.C.
And we'll sing
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Whoa whoa whoa[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Whoa whoa whoa[/tab]

[Modified Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And what if when we get back[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
To this town everything is different[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
All those friendly faces[/tab]

[faded off into the distance]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Well at least I'll still have you and you'll have me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
That's all we need[/tab]

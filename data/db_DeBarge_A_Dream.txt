Debarge - A Dream 


------------------------------------------------------------



[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
Last night I dreamed[/tab]

[tab] [ch]Fm[/ch]
That you were here with me[/tab]

[tab] [ch]Bb[/ch]
And we were in each others arms[/tab]

[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
It was oh so heavenly[/tab]

[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
You held me close to you[/tab]

[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
And whispered in my ear[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
"Let's build a life together"[/tab]

[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
Sharing love beyond compare[/tab]

[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]        [ch]Fm[/ch] 
As we danced to the melody[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]        [ch]Eb[/ch]       
We had so much to share[/tab]


(Then the music stopped)

[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]   [ch]Fm[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch] 
In a flash I was all alone[/tab]


(It was just a dream)

[tab]             [ch]Eb[/ch]  
Haunting me once again[/tab]


[Chorus:]

[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                     [ch]Fm[/ch]
A dream, a simple fantasy[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]Eb[/ch]
That I wished was reality[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Cm[/ch]                        [ch]Fm[/ch]     
That you come knocking at my door[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]Bb[/ch]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]  
And we relive this dream once more[/tab]


    
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
The day you left[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]Fm[/ch] 
You said you would return[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]Bb[/ch]
Just when you wouldn't promise[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Eb[/ch]
Said you needed time alone[/tab]

[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]   
You said you loved me[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]Fm[/ch]    
And some day our love could be[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]Bb[/ch]
I couldn't understand it[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]Eb[/ch]    
I thought that we were both happy[/tab]

[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]       [ch]Fm[/ch] 
As we danced to the melody[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]        [ch]Eb[/ch]
We had so much to share[/tab]


(Then the music stopped)

[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]   [ch]Fm[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]     
In a flash I was all alone[/tab]


(It was just a dream)

[tab]             [ch]Eb[/ch]     
Haunting me once again[/tab]


[Chorus:]

[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                     [ch]Fm[/ch]
A dream, a simple fantasy[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]Eb[/ch]
That I wished was reality[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Cm[/ch]                        [ch]Fm[/ch]     
That you come knocking at my door[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]Bb[/ch]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]  
And we relive this dream once more[/tab]

Artist: Dead Poetic
Song: The Dream Club Murders
Genre: 
Key: 


Whats up everyone, this song is freak-en elite, I hope I do it some justice.
Its tuning is a half-stepdown, not positive on that, but it makes it a little easier to sing.
First tab ever by Jacob Thompson

So after all, you needed more than a death-threat fall. [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]Bm[/ch]
You needed more, and I let you fall. [/tab]
[tab][ch]A2[/ch]                                        [ch]Em[/ch]
Into the coffin with your floor-dropped jaw. [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
And I remember you aspiration, your dream to fit in. [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
But it's gone, and they're here. [/tab]
G                                                      - - Em  Em - - Em Em - - 
So let's kill these felons now. 

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
But I remember you, you'll go, you'll find a way back home. [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
But I remember you, when you stand there, [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                                     [ch]G[/ch]
You stand with your eyes closed. [/tab]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]                             
And I feel, tonight, that I let you die. [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                                      [ch]G[/ch]
But you could have lived forever, it took smiles to keep you alive.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch] 
But heroes die, and so did mine. [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
But you go, and I stay, will it keep you at peace now. [/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
But I remember you, you'll go, you'll find a way back home. [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
But I remember you, when you stand there, [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                                     [ch]G[/ch]
You stand with your eyes closed. [/tab]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]            
And I'll dig you out, and I'll sit you up.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch] 
For the fools to find you, the fools breathe into you.  2x[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                         [ch]A[/ch]
So sleep child no one can touch you now. [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
No one can hurt you now. Not here. Anymore.[/tab]

And thats it! Enjoy!

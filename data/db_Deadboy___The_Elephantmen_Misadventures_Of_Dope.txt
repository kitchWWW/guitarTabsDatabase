There was a rhythm to the beating wings of brilliance, can't you hear it?
         D             E             D     E        G
There is terror in the heart of your silence, don't fear it, we will speak it clearly
D        E              D             E      G
Counting backwards into darkness from infinity, can't you hear me?
Laughing at the joke that no one spoke
The misadventures of dope, yeah
13 knots on a hangman's rope, friend have you counted them?
It was bloodless and hungry for hope
It was the misadventures of dope

Rabbit skull and Dead Bird, baby's got a fistfull of love, yeah she does
Dancing and Song my body aches to forget the Earth
Given enough time all things are possible, the astronomical, can't you hear me?
Laughing at the joke that no one spoke
The misadventures of dope, yeah
13 knots on a hangman's rope, friend have you counted them
It was bloodless and hungry for hope
It was the misadventures of dope

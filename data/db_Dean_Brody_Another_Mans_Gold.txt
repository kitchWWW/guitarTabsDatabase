[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
I was watchin? cartoons on a Saturday morning[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]           ([ch]G[/ch])       [ch]C[/ch]
And I heard daddy start the truck[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
I came runnin? from the house and waved him down[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Cause he was makin? a run to the dump[/tab]


[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
We watched the Bears and licked ice cream cones[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Take a little walk around[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
I?ll never forget what my daddy said[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
The day we pulled that bike from the ground[/tab]


[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
He said one man?s trash is another man?s gold[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
If it?s thrown away it?s free to take[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
A little oil she?ll be good to go[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]
So I rode that bicycle home[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Thumbs up, daddy honkin? on the horn[/tab]


[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
I got my first job workin? on a dairy farm[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]          ([ch]G[/ch])       [ch]C[/ch]
Drivin? tractor and bailin? hay[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
I?d have to circle around a bog in the ground[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
Where sat an old Mustang ?58[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
One evenin? I asked that farmer[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Why that car was just wastin? away[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]                                         [ch]Am[/ch]
He said you can have it for free it don?t mean nothin? to me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
And I couldn?t help but think[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
One man?s trash is another man?s gold[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
What someone will throw away is a crying shame[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
So I towed that Mustang home[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]
Till she could be restored[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
I got that engine to roar[/tab]

And boy did that engine roar

(Instrumental Break)

[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
It was an awkward blind date we met at a park[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]            ([ch]G[/ch])      [ch]C[/ch]
She had her little girl taggin? along[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Her beautiful smile hadn?t been out in a while[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
She was a hard working single mom[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
In time I learned he?d left her[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
He said ?I?m just way too young[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
To be having a kid, I?m not ready for this[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
If you keep it I?m good as gone?[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
He never looked back as she watched him go[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
She stood there crying in the rain till one January day[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
She had a beautiful baby girl[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]
Tonight I tuck her in and read her stories[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]             ([ch]G[/ch])       [ch]F[/ch]
And hold her mama while the sunset glows[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
My two arms full       of this man?s gold[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
What some men will throw away is a crying shame[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]       ([ch]G[/ch])     [ch]F[/ch]
Those girls make our house a home[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah my cup overflows[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]
With this man?s gold[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
This man?s gold[/tab]

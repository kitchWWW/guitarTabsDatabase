Capo I


[Intro]  [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 1]

[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
The house was like a tomb.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
I was hiding in my room.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
As my brother made his way on down the hall.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
I didn't want to say goodbye.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
And I was trying to deny there was a war,[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
And that he got the call.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bm[/ch]
I watched him from my window[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Walking down the drive.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
Then I ran down the stairway[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
Through the front door and I cried[/tab]


[Chorus 1]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You come back you hear?[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I let him see my tears[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
I said I'll give you my rookie of DiMaggio.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
I'll do anything you want,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
Clean your room, or wash your car.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]Asus4[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
I'll do anything so long as you don't go.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]Asus4[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
But he said, this is what brothers are for.[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Well I have my heroes,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
But the one I love the most[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Taught me how to hunt and swing a bat.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
And I wrote him every night,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
I said I miss our pillow fights,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
But lately I just wonder where you're at.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Sometimes freedom makes it hard to live.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]A[/ch]    
When it takes things from you that you don't want to give.[/tab]


[Chorus 2]

[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
I said you come back you hear?[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I miss you being near.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
Laugh and fish down in the maple grove[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
I'll do anything you want.[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
There must be someone I can call,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Asus4[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
And just maybe they would let you come back home.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]Asus4[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
But he wrote, this is what brothers are for.[/tab]


[Bridge]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
I may never have to face the anger of those guns,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Or lie cold and wounded in my blood,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Or know the sacrifice and what it must of cost[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]                          
For him to love me that much.[/tab]


[Verse 3]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Well, it had been two years,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
And I held back my tears[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
When I saw him in that wheel chair on the shore.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
And as I ran and held him tight,[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
That's when he looked me in the eye[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
And said I'm sorry that you have to push me home.[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]Asus4[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
And I said hey, this is what brothers are for.[/tab]

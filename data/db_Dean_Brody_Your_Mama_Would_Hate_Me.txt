[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Look at you lookin' at me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F#[/ch]
Lookin' at my tattoo through my shirt[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
With a vodka soda, walking over[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Tanned in a miniskirt[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
You're pouring it on thick[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F#[/ch]
I know where you want this to go[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
Before you give me that kiss, girl[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Here's a list of shit you need to know[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]F#[/ch]
Mm, I drink more often than not[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
I cuss every other word[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
Yeah, sometimes I smell like pot[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Been years since I've been to church[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F#[/ch]
I know I might be the one[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah, girl I'm just being honest[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]
As bad as you want it, I promise[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Your mama[/tab]

Your mama[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Your mama would hate me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
The drama I'd cause you[/tab]

It'd hurt you too bad[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
I don't wanna do that to you, baby[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Even though[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]F#[/ch]
I would treat you like a queen[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
Upon your throne[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
We don't ever need to[/tab]

She'd take one look at me, say[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
"He don't know nothin' 'bout love"[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F#[/ch]
She was hurt by my type back in the day[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
Now I'm the one that she warned you about[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]F#[/ch]
Cause, I drink more often than not[/tab]

I cuss every other word[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
Yeah, sometimes I smell like pot[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]

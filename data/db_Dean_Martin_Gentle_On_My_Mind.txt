[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
It's knowing that your door is always open [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]Dm[/ch]
and your path is free to walk.[/tab]

That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag 
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]
rolled up and stashed behind your couch.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
And it's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
words and bonds..[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]Dm[/ch]
and the ink stains that have dried up on some line..[/tab]

that keeps you in the back roads by the rivers 

of my memory..
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]
that keeps you ever gentle on my mind.[/tab]

#2.
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy planted on [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]Dm[/ch]
their columns now, that binds me.[/tab]

Or something that somebody said because they thought 
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]
we fit together, walking.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]      
It's just knowing that the world will not be [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
cursing or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
and find...[/tab]

that you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my memory..
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]
and for hours you're just gentle on my mind.[/tab]

Well, I dip my cup of soup back from the gurgling crackling [/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]              [ch]D#m[/ch]
caldron in some train yard.[/tab]
                      
My beard a roughening coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low 
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]        [ch]C#[/ch]    [ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]C#[/ch] [ch]Fm[/ch]
across my face.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#[/ch]                   [ch]Fm[/ch]         [ch]C#[/ch]                 [ch]Fm[/ch]
Through cupped hands round a tin can..I pretend I hold you to my [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D#m[/ch]
breast and find...[/tab]

that you're waving from the back roads, by the river of my memory,
[tab]     [ch]G#[/ch]                        [ch]C#[/ch]
ever smiling ever gentle on my mind.[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I looked up and saw you in the doorway[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
It was with a start that blue met blue[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                     [ch]Am[/ch]
I turned away and thought nothing more of it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
Later, I understood that it was you[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
It was cool and shaded in the graveyard[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
We walked out amidst her fallen tribes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]Am[/ch]
It was clear not a word needed be spoken[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
I took a chance and glanced into your eyes[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
And my body left the ground[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Everything was light, we were floating without sound[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
You and I were suspended with the stars[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Everything was bright, and the universe was ours[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Highway stretched out endlessly before us[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
It was with routine that blue met blue[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]Am[/ch]
All at once i swerved and we were falling[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]Dm[/ch]
Into the water, down into the gloom[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                           [ch]Am[/ch]
And then I watched as your body left the ground[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Everything went light, we were floating without sound[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
You and i were suspended with the stars[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Everything was bright and the universe was ours[/tab]

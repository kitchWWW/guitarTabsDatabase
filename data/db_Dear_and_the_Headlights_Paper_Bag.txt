[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]                [ch]C#[/ch]             [ch]A#m[/ch]
I'm like a paper cup with a pin prick[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]             [ch]C#[/ch]                                           [ch]Cm[/ch]
You can fill me up but I'll only stay full for a while[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]                       [ch]C#[/ch]                               [ch]A#m[/ch]                [ch]F#[/ch]
And wisdom's only shown me that my loneliness is all my fault[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]
And it's all my fault[/tab]

[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]           [ch]F#[/ch]
And I don't know[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]                    [ch]F#[/ch]
What I have done wrong[/tab]

[tab] [ch]A#m[/ch]                    [ch]F#[/ch]                  [ch]C#[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]          
You say you understand me well I don't get you at all[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A#m[/ch]                     [ch]F#[/ch]                  [ch]D#m[/ch]                                       [ch]F#[/ch] 
It seems everyone around me is so good at faking it that I don't know[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]           [ch]D#m[/ch]
Just how to act[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]      [ch]F#[/ch] 
Around you[/tab]


I'm like a paper bag but the bottoms wet
It must be something bleeding internally inside
I didn't know the things that you never did could stay with you your whole life

And I don't know
What I have done wrong

You say you understand me well I don't get you at all
It seems everyone around me is so good at faking it that I don't know
Just how to act
Around you
And how to act
About you

[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
I've got a memory but I can't hear what you're saying[/tab]
[tab]                                                   [ch]C#[/ch]
You're looking straight at me but I'm looking the other way[/tab]

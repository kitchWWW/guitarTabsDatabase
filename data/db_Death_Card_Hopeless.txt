Verse 1: 

Am                               G         Em 
  I talked to myself All the time,I thought about all the things I've done 
Am                             G        Em 
  Murder, hate and million lies,The only things that really did in my life
 
Interlude: 

Am       G      Em    X2
                   
Chorus: 

C             D                          A
 I thought the best things I've ever done,But I realized that it was all bad
C        D                    A
 Without hope and without life,But does anyone really care?
C           D                     A
 Visionary show just blood spilled,For me the world looks really sick
 
F  Em
     Because I'm hopeless     
                     
Interlude:

Am       G      Em

Verse 2:  

  Am                                G           Em
I killed,I lied,I have spent my life For the one that caught my eye
Am                               G           Em
 But then she went with another guy,And I was left with a broken heart

B            G            D
 and All the pain that I passed 
B           G             D   
 reminds me of all my mistakes    yeah 

Chorus: 

C             D                          A
 I thought the best things I've ever done,But I realized that it was all bad
C        D                    A
 Without hope and without life,But does anyone really care?
C           D                     A
 Visionary show just blood spilled,For me the world looks really sick
 
F  Em                      
     Because I'm hopeless

  This world don't always perfect (the world don't always perfect)
D          A                   B

Please help me with this tab I will be very grateful to any one that could give me any
feed back, additions or corrections to this tab (I love this song and want the tabs for
both guitars, but I can't do it). It is only the chords that the first guitar plays.
Just listen for the strumming. I don't know why no one tabs Death on Wednesday they're
so good

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                                     [ch]F[/ch] [ch]F#[/ch]
  Great snakes, are we moving already?[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]G#m[/ch]
Good gravy, did you say it cost a penny or two for you?[/tab]

We're talking 'bout the bad starts
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
  My baby brother has already got a gas mask[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                                  [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]F#[/ch]
  'Cause it's a good old-fashioned landslide[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G#m[/ch]
Killin' with your hands tied[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]B[/ch]
In the homemade road, set sail[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C#[/ch]
Babe, we read it in The Mail, no hope now[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
  Great way to fool me again, hun[/tab]

Great acting, it's good what you tell 'em
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
  Great Britain won't stand for felons[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
  Great British bombs in the Yemen[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
Why does it seem[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G#m[/ch]
A fever dream for all?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]
The call you made to me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F#[/ch]
You said I'll feel[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
One day each year, a worry[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G#m[/ch]
We shall remember the dead[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]B[/ch]                            [ch]C#[/ch]
And we'll remember the dead so they know that we're sorry[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F#[/ch]
But then carry on[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
  Great way to fool me again, hun[/tab]

Great acting, it's great what you tell 'em
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]

[Verse 3]
[tab]    [ch]F#[/ch]
How could it be the money? It's the vote that matters to me[/tab]

You say you're hungry, but you won't eat the caraway seed
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
  Doesn't matter in the wreckage, what should you say?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
  Well, I found myself a little peckish last Tuesday[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
  This is what you signed up for, no questions[/tab]
[tab]                                                 [ch]G#m[/ch]
Reckon we could offer peace, damn the weapons conventions[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]C#[/ch]
Well, it's on the table, but it's no good, can't you hear[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]F#[/ch]
All our worries for fear, carry on[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
  Great way to fool me again, hun[/tab]

Great acting, it's great what you tell 'em
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
  Great Britain won't stand for felons[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
  Great British bombs in the Yemen[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
  Great way to fool me again, hun[/tab]

Great acting, it's great what you tell 'em
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
  It's a good old-fashioned landslide[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G#m[/ch]
Killing with your hands tied[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]B[/ch]
In the homemade road, set sail[/tab]

Babe, we read it in The Mail, no hope now
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
  And it's a total fucking whitewash[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G#m[/ch]
The people that we might squash[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]B[/ch]
And move from home soil, set sail[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]F#[/ch]
For wherever the fuck got oil this time[/tab]

And if it's not a fucking war crime
[tab]                      [ch]G#m[/ch]
It's a total waste of your time[/tab]

And getting so much worse
[tab]          [ch]B[/ch]
Get real, kid, your country's been at war since birth now[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                                                  [ch]G#m[/ch]
  And if it's not a fucking outrage, what's it all about then?[/tab]

Now, it's one on one
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
Great Britain's gonna tell you where it all went wrong and then carry on[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
  Great way to fool me again, hun[/tab]

Great acting as well, what you tell 'em
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
  Great Britain won't stand for felons[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
  Great British bombs in the Yemen[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
  Great way to fool me again, hun[/tab]

Great acting as well, what you tell 'em
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
  Great Britain won't stand for felons[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                               [ch]Bm[/ch]
  Great British bombs in the Yemen[/tab]

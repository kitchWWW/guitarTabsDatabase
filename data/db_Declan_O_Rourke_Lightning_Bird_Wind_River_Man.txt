Song: Lightning Bird Wind River Man
Genre: 
Key: 


   
Well here it is, my first tab( and probably last!). Had to write up all the lyrics 
too so you lot better enjoy it! Didn't realize this tabbing stuff is hard work....

Great song from talented Irishman. Well done Declan!



Tips:
The B minor in the verse has no root note. You can also use  D chord instead of Bm if you prefer. 
I mix up this song with bar and higher chords etc to get the sound right. If 
you've got some money from the dole buy his cd and support Declan O Rourke!!

enjoy:-)

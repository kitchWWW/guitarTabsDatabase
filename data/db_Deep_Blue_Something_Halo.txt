[VERSE]

Am               C
Souls suffer the landscape
   Am                 C
In shrouds of dew, as ghosts.
Am                C
Their eternity is for searching
      Am                 C
But a certain dissension grows.
Am             C
I've seen them wander,
Am               C
Voices raised in prayer
Am              C
Consorting with whisper,
     Am                C
They curse the one not there.

[BRIDGE] (electric plays intro riff)

   G                        Am
If you didn't want this and I didn't need it,
     G                     Am
Then how has this interest become an addiction?
   G                        Am               C
If you didn't want it, then why can't you do without?

[VERSE] play same chords a first verse

I know I'm not your first one,
But I pray I'll be your last.
I've never seen you cry before,
But I know when I make you laugh.
I know and you know, you've heard this all before...
These arms are for holding on.
This heart won't stray from home.

[BRIDGE] (electric plays intro riff)

If you didn't want this and I didn't need it,
Then how has this interest become an addiction?
If you didn't want it, then why can't you do without?

Em G     Em G     Em G
I  know, I  know, I  know
         Am             C
God tell me, where's my Halo?

[OUTRO] x2 (play bridge chords)

If you didn't want this and I didn't need it,
Then how has this interest become an addiction?
If you didn't want it, then why can't you do without?

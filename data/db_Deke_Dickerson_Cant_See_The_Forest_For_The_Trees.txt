[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I gave you some flowers and a card[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]D[/ch]
I put a statue of you in my backyard[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
Well woman what’s it gonna take to get me on your mind[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                              [ch]G[/ch]
I’m sending those smoke signals but you seem to be blind[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
And I said, you can’t see the forest for the trees[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]D[/ch]
You can’t see the honey for the bees[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
If it was a snake it would have bitten you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
I’m a-giving up on getting you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
You can’t see the forest for the trees[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Well I wrote you a book of poetry[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
I thought that it might turn you on to me[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
I dressed up in a suit, and asked about my sense of rhyme[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                                  [ch]G[/ch]
You said you didn’t read it ‘cause you didn’t have the time[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
And I said, you can’t see the forest for the trees[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]D[/ch]
You can’t see the honey for the bees[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
If it was a snake it would have bitten you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
I’m a-giving up on getting you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
You can’t see the forest for the trees[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Well I thought that I would give it one more try[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
I wrote your name up in letters in the sky[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
Well I asked you what you thought but to my agitation[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
You told me that you thought it was a natural formation[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
And I said, you can’t see the forest for the trees[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]D[/ch]
You can’t see the honey for the bees[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
If it was a snake it would have bitten you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
I’m a-giving up on getting you[/tab]

You can’t see the forest for the trees[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
You can’t see the forest for the trees[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
You can’t see the forest for the trees[/tab]

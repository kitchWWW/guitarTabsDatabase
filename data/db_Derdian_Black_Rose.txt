Derdian – Black rose

Sorry cause it’s not the original pitch, i better like it cause it’s easier to play the
intro this way. It’s a semitone higher, the original one is in G-sharp minor, you can
play it for example with capo in the 4th fret, the chords: Em C G D B7, or tune the 
guitar a half step down.
*       slide up 4 frets with the G chord, then palm
**      pick up your 2nd finger
If you’ve got any ideas, tips or something else please email me: xk2006x@gmail.com
Please rate and comment. :)

Oh my dear enemy you know
What I just did to your sweet black rose
Died trying to make me fall in love

I found her just one month ago
Suffering and begging in a hole
To be saved and to be nursed


What d'you wanna do the next time
Whom you want to send me again?

Woman, just a black rose
This has been your role
That brought you to fall
Let me say weren't wise
It's impossible you know
For your lord to rise

This has been your role

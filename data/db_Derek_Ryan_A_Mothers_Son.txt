[Verse]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
I still can see the rising sun and feel the morning breeze,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
The faithful day I set on my way to try and find my dreams.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
The world was right before my eyes, my home I left behind.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
My mother held me close to her heart and said with a tear in her eye,[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
No one's perfection, but learn from the wrongs that you do,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
Be true to yourself, your family and friends,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
And the woman that cherishes you.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
A loving touch can be worth so much more,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]
Than the diamonds and rings we adore,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
It's how you were raised to be,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
When you’re away from me,   your mother's son.[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab]                                                [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Though these simple words stayed in my mind the time went rolling by,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
And down the track I found my way back, from the bustle and cities bright lights.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Now the music flows and love it grows, my sweetheart I have  met,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
At night I hold her close to my heart and promise I'll never forget.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
No one's perfection, but learn from the wrongs that you do,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
Be true to yourself, your family and friends,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
And the woman that cherishes you.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
A loving touch can be worth so much more,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]
Than the diamonds and rings we adore,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
It's how you were raised to be,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
When you’re away from me,   your mother's son.[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]
It's a bittersweet goodbye[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Dm7[/ch]
Tears are in your eyes[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Am7[/ch]
Said some things I can't take back[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]
Should've met you halfway[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Dm7[/ch]
Instead of asking you to change[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am7[/ch]
I wish it didn't go like that[/tab]

[pre chorus]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]
Yeah I'm trying[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm7[/ch]
To let go[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am7[/ch]
And I wish you would let me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]
I hope[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm7[/ch]
That you won't[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am7[/ch]
So don't hold it against me, no[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Dm7[/ch]
If this is where I leave you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am7[/ch]
Then I'm gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I swear I didn't mean to[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am7[/ch]
Do you wrong[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
Maybe you and me[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Dm7[/ch]
Were never meant to be[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am7[/ch]
And we've only got tonight[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]Dm7[/ch]
So if this is where I leave you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#maj7[/ch]   [ch]Cm7[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
Could I hold you one last time?[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]                              [ch]F[/ch]
Could we pretend that you and me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm7[/ch]
Won't be a memory?[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Am7[/ch]
Tell me that we're bulletproof[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]F[/ch]
And when you fall for someone new[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Dm7[/ch]
Don't forget the hell[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am7[/ch]
That I used to put you through[/tab]

[pre chorus]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]
Yeah I'm trying[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm7[/ch]
To let go[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am7[/ch]
And I wish you would let me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]
I hope[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm7[/ch]
That you won't[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am7[/ch]
So don't hold it against me, no[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Dm7[/ch]
If this is where I leave you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am7[/ch]
Then I'm gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                [ch]Dm7[/ch]

[Outro]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]Dm7[/ch]

[tab]              [ch]Am7[/ch]    [ch]C#maj7[/ch]
Could I hold you? (Time~)[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]Fm11[/ch]
One last time[/tab]

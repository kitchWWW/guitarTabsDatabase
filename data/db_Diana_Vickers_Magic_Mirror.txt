Artist: Diana Vickers
Song: Magic Mirror
Genre: 
Key: 


I tried a little bit and found the chords for Magic Mirror by Diana Vickers. (:
It's really simple, but the "Em" is not perfect here, so I'm really sorry,
but I didnt find another good chord .. so anyway.
I love this song, and I hope that some of you love it, too, and that I could help you. (: 
Oh, the tuning .. ehm, do it how you want. :'D 
You can use the simplest but nice version of tuning if you can't change the 
chords fast. You play the Chord just Up&Up then next chord Up&Up and so on. 
HAVE FUN! :]

[Intro]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Love? A fairytale in my old book of fantasy[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em7[/ch]                           [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Trust? But better control before you want to believe[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Warmth? You're totally hot or out there in the cold[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em7[/ch]                      [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Wrong, is what I was thinking[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Say, that I am your girl and that you love me only[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                         [ch]Am7[/ch]
Time, is rushing away and you're still not here with me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Cool, I should be when you say that you don't like my hair[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                 [ch]Am7[/ch]
Why, am I even with you, why  I stay?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
OUR LOVE IS HISTORY[/tab]
[tab][ch]D/F#[/ch]
CAUSE YOU DON'T CARE FOR ME[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I'M LEAVING, THIS IS GOODBYE, GOODBYE yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
YOU'RE NEVER BY MY SIDE[/tab]
[tab][ch]D/F#[/ch]
I WANT TO LIVE MY LIFE[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
THIS IS THE END, CAN'T YOU SEE IT[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Say, that all is o.k. and that you are still my man[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                         [ch]Am7[/ch]
Time, is slipping away and you are not here again[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Cold, is your face when you?re talking about our life[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                  [ch]Am7[/ch]
why?  ?Are you my lover...[/tab]

[Bridge 1]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
...or is it more????[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
I should have known[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Hm[/ch]
that it was wrong[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
to think that love is everlasting[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
?I should have never been together with you!?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
OUR LOVE IS HISTORY[/tab]
[tab][ch]D/F#[/ch]
CAUSE YOU DON'T CARE FOR ME[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]Cadd9[/ch]

[Bridge 2]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]

I could be anytime alone[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D/F#[/ch]
But it's now that the story is dead[/tab]

I will never be sad[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
you were playing with me all the time[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D/F#[/ch]
 Why didn't you ever say you prefer the other way[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]            [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
  you're not like the other guys around, yeah[/tab]

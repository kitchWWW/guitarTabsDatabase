INTRO:
[ch]A[/ch]
[ch]A[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]

VERSE:
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
She's my walkin' livin' breathin' country boy's dream[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
It kinda makes me wonder what it is she sees in me[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]
I know it ain't my movie star looks she can't resist[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]
And when I ask her what it is[/tab]


CHORUS:
[tab] [ch]E[/ch]  N.C.
She says she loves me for my[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
Big heart and my silver belt buckle[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
My triple-x jean jacket when she likes to cuddle[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
My big bear hugs she can't get 'er arms around[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
I bought a big ol' diamond and she shows it 'round town[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
She swears she loves the big dreams I keep in my head[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
And my 14 double-e boots under her bed[/tab]
[tab] [ch]E[/ch]
Naw she won't admit it but I'm tellin' ya what[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
Sometimes I think she only loves me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
For my big truck[/tab]


VERSE:
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
The way it makes her smile makes it hard to hide[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
Seems like all she wants to do is take a ride[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]
Might as well get her name decaled on the door[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
I swear that's all she wants me for[/tab]

BREAK:
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
When she's riding high she's my little queen[/tab]

Thinks my king ranch is her limousine[/tab]

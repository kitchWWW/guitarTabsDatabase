[INTRO]
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Girl, I knew it was a matter of time[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
'Fore you got dolled up, pulled into my drive[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                            [ch]G[/ch]
And apologized 'cause the other night you went crazy[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You said you're just here to collect your stuff[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
Now you're cryin' and you're talkin' 'bout makin' up[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                                   [ch]G[/ch]
Like you wanna come back, let me think about that now, baby, well[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
I'd rather drink a hot beer[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Build a fire in the pourin' rain[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
Burn all my fishing gear[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Then set sail in a hurricane[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Go hunting with an empty gun[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
And see a once in a lifetime deer[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Work a Saturday just for fun[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Then come home and drink a hot beer[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
I'm sorry if it sounds kinda overboard[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
But you cheated and you lied and you wrecked my Ford[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                                          [ch]G[/ch]
So you might as well stay there on the porch now honey[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
If you wanna know the odds of another try[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
They're about the same as a tractor flyin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
Quit your laughin' girl, I ain't tryna be funny[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
I'd rather drink a hot beer[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Build a fire in the pourin' rain[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
Burn all my fishing gear[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Then set sail in a hurricane[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Go hunting with an empty gun[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
And see a once in a lifetime deer[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Work a Saturday just for fun[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Then come home and drink a hot beer[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Come home and drink a skunked, old, totally not cold[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Flat and scratched 'cause it's done been rolled[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
In the back of the bed with the trash and the tools[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Hell, I'd even pop an O'Douls over you, yeah, ayy[/tab]

[Solo]

[ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

[Chorus]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
I'd rather drink a hot beer[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Turn it up and take a long sip[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Hell, I'd even take big swig[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Of Uncle Bubbas old dip spit[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Go hunting with an empty gun[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
And see once in a lifetime deer[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Work a Saturday just for fun[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Then come home and drink a hot beer[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Come home and drink a hot beer[/tab]

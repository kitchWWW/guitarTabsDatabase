[Verse 1]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
It was twenty-five cents at the gumball machine[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm7[/ch]                                                  [ch]A[/ch]
And that's twenty-five more than ya have when you're three[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]G[/ch]
It blew my mind how a quarter appeared, from behind his ear[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Spinner bait burned a hole in my Levi's[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm7[/ch]
The lake was too far for a bike ride[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
When Momma was busy and Daddy was gone[/tab]
[tab]N.C.     [ch]D[/ch]
I'd call Grandpa[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
He was Superman in overalls[/tab]

Had a fightin' side he left behind in 'nam in '67[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A/C#[/ch]
If there was a landline that ran right[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
To the country side of hеaven[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
And I had one call[/tab]
[tab]N.C.     [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
I'd call Grandpa[/tab]

Pickin' out that pawn shop ring[/tab]

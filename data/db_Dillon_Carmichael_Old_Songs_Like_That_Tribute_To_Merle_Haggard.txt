[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch]
Chiseled in stone still chokes me up sometime.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A7[/ch]                                              [ch]D[/ch]
He stopped lovin' her today brings a tear to a grown man's eye.[/tab]
[tab]                                                               [ch]G[/ch]
Take this job and shove it makes me smile when I've had a hard day.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A7[/ch]                                           [ch]D[/ch]
Sure seems like those old cats knew, just what to say.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
I miss heart and soul, and a pedal steel guitar.[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A7[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Three quarter time, and a honky tonk bar.[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Bm[/ch]
They say it's gone, and it ain't comin' back.[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A7[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
They can say what they want, I miss old songs like that.[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                                             [ch]G[/ch]
Haggard and Hank, they always lived what they wrote.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A7[/ch]                                                       [ch]D[/ch]
You believe what they sang, and you can feel it in every single note.[/tab]
[tab]                                                           [ch]G[/ch]
I don't mind the new stuff, but truth is, that's not who I am.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A7[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
I'm a picker, a singer, a natural born blues man.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
I miss heart and soul, and a pedal steel guitar.[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A7[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Three quarter time, and a honky tonk bar.[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
They say it's gone, and it ain't comin' back.[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A7[/ch]
They can say what they want, but the cold hard fact...[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
I miss old songs like that.[/tab]

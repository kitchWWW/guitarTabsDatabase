NOTE: This was a request for this tab to be done in standard tuning. I did it 
      that way to honor the request. However, I believe that Dillon Carmichael 
      plays it tuned down a half-step without a capo. If you prefer to play it that
      that way then either do not use this tab or tune your guitar down a half-step
      and transpose the chords here accordingly. I leave that choice up to you.
      Please keep this in mind when playing and rating this tab. Thanks.

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G/B[/ch]
 I heard that you're settled down[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
And you found a man and you're married now[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G/B[/ch]
I heard that your dreams came true[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
 Old friend, why are you so shy?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I hoped you'd see my face[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]
I wish nothing but the best for you, too[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
"Don't forget me," I beg[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
I remember you said[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
 You know how the time flies[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
Only yesterday was the time of our lives[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
We were born and raised in a summer haze[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
Bound by the surprise of our glory days[/tab]



[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I hoped you'd see my face[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over[/tab]

"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Nothing compares, no worries, no cares[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made[/tab]

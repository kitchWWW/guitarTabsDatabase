[Verse]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
You walked in like you didn't know I'd be here[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]C[/ch]
Sippin' that same ole beer on the same barstool[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
You told me that you didn't wanna see me again[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
For the last 2 weeks, I've been drinking over you[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
I ain't heard nothing from ya since you said goodbye[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
And everybody says that you've been doing just fine[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
But for someone who's long gone over it[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am7[/ch]
You sure got a funny way of showing it[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Showing up here, baby, looking like that[/tab]

In that dress I love with your hair pulled back

[tab] [ch]C[/ch]
Shooting that look from across the bar[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am7[/ch]
Like maybe goodbye didn't get you that far[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
Last I heard you were already all moved on[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]Am7[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
It sure seems like you sure miss me[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
For someone who don't miss me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
At all[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Your friends all left but you stayed behind[/tab]

Now you got another glass of wine
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
And you're sipping it slow[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
That old jukebox started playing our song[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]C[/ch]
Now who put that one on, girl I bet I know[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
Now here you come on a b-line walking my way[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Like you wanna give this break-up a break-a-a-eak[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
For someone who's long gone over it[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am7[/ch]
You sure got a funny way of showing it[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Showing up here, baby, looking like that[/tab]

In that dress I love with your hair pulled back

[tab] [ch]C[/ch]
Getting me lost in your baby blue eyes[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am7[/ch]
Leaning in, slipping your hand in mine[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
Last I heard you were already all moved on[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]Am7[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Yeah it sure seems like you sure miss me[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
For someone who don't miss me[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]D/F#[/ch]
At all-al-all[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
Now I've got you on the dance floor[/tab]

Spinning you around
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
Back in my arms, ain't it funny how[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
Last I heard you were already all moved on[/tab]

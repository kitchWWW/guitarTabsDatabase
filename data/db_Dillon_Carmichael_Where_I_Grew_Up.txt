[Verse 1]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
Where I grew up[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
We rode around with shotguns[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
Everybody had one[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
In their truck[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
And that old screen door[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
It was always standing open[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
Everybody knowin'[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
It wasn't locked up[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
And we never had to worry bout a thing[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Where I grew up[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
We had a dirt road underneath our feet[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
And Old Glory flying high in every yard[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Yeah and probably to some[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
It didn't look like much[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
But we always had enough[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
Where I grew up[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
Momma drug your butt to church[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
And those whippins always hurt more[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
When you had to pick your own switch[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
We were tough[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
We didn't have time to complain[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
And we didn't sweat the small things[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
No matter what[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
Somehow we all survived[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Where I grew up[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
We had a dirt road underneath our feet[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
And Old Glory flying high in every yard[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Yeah and probably to some[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
It didn't look like much[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
But we always had enough[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Where I grew up[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Where I grew up[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
Where I grew up[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
That's where they'll lay me down[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
On the outskirts of town[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
On that quiet piece of land[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Where I grew up[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
We had a dirt road underneath our feet[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
And Old Glory flying high in every yard[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]

It didn't look like much[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
But we always had enough[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
With Mom and Daddy's love[/tab]

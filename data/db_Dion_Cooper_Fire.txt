[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]Bm[/ch]
  I thought I would be good by now[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]A[/ch]
That I could just play the songs I wrote to you without freaking out[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Bm7[/ch]
I thought I would've worked it out but I'm back here on the ground[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
Cause I keep tripping over myself now that you're not around[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Bm7[/ch]
Honey you should know that I don't wanna go[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
We wouldn't just go back to how it was before[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
There wouldn't all be roses[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Bm7[/ch]
And you can still hate me sometimes[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
If we'd only focus to see us in a better light[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
We could be Fire[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]Bm[/ch]
  I thought I would be fine by now[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
That I could just wear your T-shirt, without crying my eyes out[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]G[/ch]
I know I shouldn't dream out loud[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
Cause I'm losing what I've never found[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Loving you in my head felt better[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
but that didn't quite turn out[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
Honey you should know that I don't wanna go[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
We wouldn't just go back to how it was before[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
There wouldn't all be roses[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Bm7[/ch]
And you can still hate me sometimes[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
If we'd only focus to see us in a better light[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Then we could be Fire[/tab]

If you meet me halfway in the middle of the rain, stay with me all night[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
We wouldn't be afraid and I'll be okay then we could be Fire[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Bm[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
Forget about the pain just do it anyway then we could be Fire[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Bm7[/ch]
We could be Fire[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Bm7[/ch]
We could be Fire[/tab]

We could be Fire[/tab]

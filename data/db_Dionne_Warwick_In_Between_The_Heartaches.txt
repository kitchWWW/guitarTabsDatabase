In Between The Heartaches 
  
[tab][ch]D#m7[/ch]
In between the heartaches[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Bbm7[/ch]             [ch]Cm7[/ch] 
You hold me here in your arms and say you love me[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#m7[/ch]
In between the heartaches[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Bbm7[/ch]                 [ch]Cm7[/ch]
The way you kiss I can tell you're thinking of me[/tab]
I know you love me
[tab]                              [ch]Gm7[/ch]   [ch]Cm7[/ch]
And that makes up for all the heartaches[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Gm7[/ch]  [ch]Cm7[/ch]        [ch]Gm7[/ch]   [ch]Cm7[/ch]
And the sadness and the tears[/tab]

[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                                       [ch]G#m[/ch]
Everyone keeps asking me why I stay with you[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bb6[/ch]
The way you hurt me [/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                                        [ch]G#m[/ch]
They can see how many times I'm alone and blue[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bb6[/ch]
When you desert me[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Cm7[/ch]         [ch]Fm[/ch]        [ch]Fm9[/ch]  
Oh you come and go without a letter[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm7[/ch]          [ch]Fm[/ch]            [ch]Fm9[/ch]        [ch]Gm7[/ch]
And they say that I should get up and go[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]               [ch]Gm7[/ch] 
They don't know, they don't know that[/tab]

In between the heartaches...

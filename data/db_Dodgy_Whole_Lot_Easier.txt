{verse}:
G                Am
It's a whole lot easier like this
  C                    G
'Cos you weren't in my life
G            Am
But I don't think you'll always
C                  F
Be wrestling on my mind
F
And my friends tell me it's for the best
F                            G
And that truth is sometimes unkind

{chorus}:
C                D                     F        C
I don't want to see you know that you are gone
                 D
Certain yes it's certain
             F         C
But I think I can go on


{same as verse chords}:

Walking home alone again
>From somewhere I can't remember
I got lost along the way
In this sprawling September
My friends tell me it's for the best
And that truth is sometimes unkind

{same as chorus chords}:

I don't want to see you know that you are gone
Certain yes it's certain
But I think I can go on
I don't want to see you know that you are gone
I'm so glad I left you
I'm so glad we're done


{little solo on G-Am-C-F}:


{same as chorus chords}:

I don't want to see you know that you are gone
Certain yes it's certain
But I think I can go on
I don't want to see you know that you are gone
I'm so glad I left you
I'm so glad we're done

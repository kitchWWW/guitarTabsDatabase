Em                       Am
  I've got nothing on my mind
               D
  Nothing to remember
G               Em
  Nothing to forget
               Am           D
  And I've got nothing to regret
G                              Am
  But I'm all tied up on the inside
C        D                     G
  No-one knows quite what I've got
Em                          Am
  And I know that on the outside
         C                D       G
  What I used to be - I'm not, anymore


G                                       Am
  You know I've heard about people like me
C             D           G
  But I never made the connection
G                                Am
  They walk one road to set them free
C                                   D
  And find they've gone the wrong direction
G                                 Am
  But there's no need for turning back
C                  D               G
  'cause all roads lead to where I stand
Em                             Am
  And I believe I'll walk them all
C           D               G
  No matter what I may have planned


Em                       Am
  Can you remember who I was
Am7             D
  Can you still feel it
G         Am7  D  Em
  Can you find my pain
C         D
  Can you heal it
G                            Am
  And lay your hands upon me now
C               D                G
  And cast this darkness from my soul
Em                       Am
  You alone can light my way
C                       D      G
  You alone can make me whole, once again


G                                  Am
  We've walked both sides of ev'ry street
C             D              G
  Through all kinds of windy weather
G                        Am
  But that was never our defeat
C                            D
  As long as we could walk together
G                                Am
  So there's no need for turning back
C                  D                G
  'cause all roads lead to where we stand
Em                              Am
  And I believe we'll walk them all
C           D                Em  
  No matter what we may have planned

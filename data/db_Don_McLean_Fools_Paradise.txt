[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You took me up to heaven, and then you took me in your arms,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
I was dazzled by your beauty, blinded by your charms.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
I was lost in Fools Paradise, good and lost in a Fools Paradise.[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
But then you told me that you loved me,[/tab]

and then I gave my heart to you.
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
But, well,  I wondered if there could be any truth in love so new,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
I was lost in a Fools Paradise, good and lost in a Fools Paradise.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
The whole world was my kingdom,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
and your love the gem in my crown,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
but when I saw you then with a new romance,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
you know, my love came tumbling down.[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
Well  you treat kind of coolish, and you never let me know,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
That you think I'm being foolish because I love you so.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
I still get lost in a Fools paradise, good and lost in a Fools Paradise.[/tab]

The whole world was my kingdom,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
you know, my love came tumbling down.[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]

Every night, every day, every week, every hour

I’ve been thinking of your face again

I’ve been thinking of your face again

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
You lost your job and got a shitty redundancy, [/tab]

and then you asked me “would you come see the world with me?”
[tab][ch]F#m/C#[/ch]
They’re hiring teachers out in Ho Chi Minh City, [/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
and when I couldn’t go you said “just catch up with me.” [/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Got qualified within a week at the Bridge Mills, [/tab]

and then you packed your bags to head for the hills. 
[tab][ch]F#m/C#[/ch]
I walked you to the gate where you said goodbye to [/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
the saddest girl in the whole world.[/tab]

When we are together, we could take on this world on our own[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]

[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]
When we get back together, we’ll be the happiest people on earth[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#m[/ch]                        [ch]B[/ch]
Until then, send a letter to the saddest girl in the world[/tab]

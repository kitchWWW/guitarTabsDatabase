[intro]
[ch]Eb[/ch] [ch]Ebmaj7[/ch]

[couplet]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]              [ch]Ebmaj7[/ch]                   [ch]Cm7[/ch]
The wind carries her perfume through an open door,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Gm#5[/ch]                [ch]Ab[/ch]
into a corner street cafe.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Ab-5[/ch]
And she's to close for comfort.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Ab/Bb[/ch]
but for holding she's too far away.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                       [ch]Ebmaj7[/ch]
And the days are growing shorter[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cm7[/ch]             [ch]Gm#5[/ch]
as the nights are oh so long.[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Ab[/ch]
Since she's been gone I draw my strength[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Ab-5[/ch]
from memories and melodies,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Ab/Bb[/ch]
that's how I wrote this song.[/tab]


[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                [ch]Ebmaj7[/ch]
And take me home Johnny,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Cm7[/ch]              [ch]Gm#5[/ch]                   [ch]Ab-5[/ch]    [ch]Ab[/ch]   [ch]Ab/Bb[/ch]
Cause I can't take to see her with another guy.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]           [ch]Ebmaj7[/ch]    [ch]Cm7[/ch]            [ch]Gm#5[/ch]
And isn't it funny it seems like yesterday[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Ab[/ch]                       [ch]Ab-5[/ch]      [ch]Ab[/ch]   [ch]Bb9[/ch]  [ch]Bb9/B[/ch]
when she told me her love was mine.[/tab]

[bridge]
[tab][ch]Cm7[/ch]
But she's to cool for lovin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm7/F[/ch]
and she's to cold I've learned.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm7[/ch]
She's too hard to handle,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]                    [ch]Bb9[/ch]
she's too hard I'll burn.[/tab]

[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                           [ch]Ab[/ch]
And I went out in the fields today,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                             [ch]Ab[/ch]
to scream out loud and call her name.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm#5[/ch]                       [ch]Ab[/ch]
You wanna fly, I wanna bound.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]                 [ch]Ab/Bb[/ch]        [ch]Eb[/ch]
The less you give, the more I want.[/tab]

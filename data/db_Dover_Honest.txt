Honest? I don't think you heard me[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
It's not that you have to do it[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
It's simply my commend[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]
I know, 'have been very busy[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Bm[/ch]
You don't have the right to do this[/tab]

You're stupid like all your friends[/tab]

It's you and your goddamn cowboys[/tab]

You've been so annoying[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
I'm cutting you off again[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
It's true, I've tried to ignore you[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
But you look kinda slutty[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
I bet that you think I care[/tab]

Honest? I don't think you like me[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
And I just don't like you either[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]

You're bossy like all the rest[/tab]

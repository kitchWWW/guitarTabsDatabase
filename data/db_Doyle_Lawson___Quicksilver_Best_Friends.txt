[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
an orphan boy with no place to go[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
she looked at his tattered coat[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
his worn out shoes and little red nose[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
she said come on in there's warm food on the stove[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
he ate and then she said[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
a warm bath for you and off to bed[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
that's when she saw a tear run down his cheek[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
he said ma'am I don't know john 3:16[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
I don't know why but he has sure been good to me today[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
he made this poor bad glad[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
and I'm thankful for the food the fire and a good warm bed[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]D[/ch]
when you see him will you tell him for me[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
tell him I'm not cold lonely or sad[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
years came & went and often she would think of him[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
and remember when he knelt down & prayed[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
revival came to town they said the preacher was renowned[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
so she went to the church down the street[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
when he stood to preach tears ran down her cheeks[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
he said open up your bibles to john 3:16[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
he said he's made this lost boy saved[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
and I'm thankful for his sacrifice and what he did that day[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
he found me when I was just a lad[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
Now I'm not orphaned or alone and now I have a dad[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
and john 3:16 is still the best friend I've ever had[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
for God so loved the world he's still the best friend I've ever had[/tab]

**I don't think the band has a website, but Northeast Records has a copy of
one of their albums: http://www.northeastrecords.com/ Unfortunately it's out
of print, but this song is a free MP3 sample of the music on the multi-artist 
album "The Aggravated Music BBQ Sampler"**

This whole song took me about ten minutes to work out - that's how simple it
is! Anyway, it's a great song by a great band, so enjoy! :D

Standard Tuning (eBGDAE)

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]                                       [ch]Bbm[/ch]
Dark auditorium, half of the audience sleeps[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Ab[/ch]                   [ch]Bbm[/ch]                        [ch]Ab[/ch]
I am awake through every display of doubt turning the grave[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]Gb[/ch]   [ch]Ab[/ch]                   [ch]Bbm[/ch] [ch]Ab[/ch]
While you were watching the back of your eyelids[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bbm[/ch] [ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch]
I was awake[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
Broken and battered and split like an atom[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bbm[/ch]                          [ch]Ab[/ch]
In debt to god, but what's it to you[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Bbm[/ch]
If somewhere a glass jewel breaks[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Ab[/ch]
And rings like a bell[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]Gb[/ch]   [ch]Ab[/ch]                 [ch]Bbm[/ch]  [ch]Ab[/ch]
Are you bandaging feet or done with the Peace Corps?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bbm[/ch] [ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch]
I couldn't tell[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Ab[/ch]
Now I'm putting drinks away[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Ab[/ch]
Like a poet on payday[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Gb[/ch]
And I'm not toasting your name[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
Or your good health[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]      [ch]Ab[/ch]
When twenty years of peace[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Bbm[/ch]
Fall under the roof of love[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Ab[/ch]
And every heart seems[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Bbm[/ch]
To beat like a broken drum[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Ab[/ch]
Now I'm putting drinks away[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Ab[/ch]
Like a poet on payday[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Gb[/ch]
And I'm not toasting your name[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Ab[/ch]
Or your good health[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]                         [ch]Db[/ch]
They say the thing about starts[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Ab[/ch]
Is you're risking them finishing[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Db[/ch]
And a line of love[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Ab[/ch]
Draws maps on your skin[/tab]

[tab]                              [ch]Db[/ch]
Well, that's the thing about shoes[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Ab[/ch]
You know some of us live in them[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Db[/ch]
When it's too late to want love[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Ab[/ch]
I'll know where I've been[/tab]

[tab]                         [ch]Db[/ch]
They say the thing about starts[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Ab[/ch]
Is they're made out of finishes[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Db[/ch]
And a longing of love[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Ab[/ch]
Draws maps on your skin[/tab]

[tab]                              [ch]Db[/ch]
Well, that's the thing about shoes[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Ab[/ch]
You know some of us live in them[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Db[/ch]
When it's too late to want love[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Ab[/ch]
I'll know where I've been[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Bbm[/ch]   [ch]Fm[/ch]   [ch]Ab[/ch]      [ch]Bbm[/ch]   [ch]Fm[/ch]   [ch]Ab[/ch]
I'll know where I've been[/tab]

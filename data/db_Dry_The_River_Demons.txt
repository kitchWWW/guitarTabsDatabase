CAPO 1st Fret | By Conor Stapleton


[tab][ch]C[/ch]     [ch]C/F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
You are the string in my bow. [/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]     [ch]C/F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
Biblical Mary to Joe. [/tab]
       
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
The North isn't true 'til it's leading me to you. [/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]     [ch]C/F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
You are the way that I know. [/tab]


[ch]Am[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]


Under the weight of belief 
You shiver and shake like a leaf. 
But death is a force, not a man on a horse: 
I'll keep you safe while you sleep. 


[tab][ch]F[/ch]
We fight those demons day in and day out, [/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Day in and day out, day in and day out [/tab]


And fight those demons day in and day out 
Day in and day out, day in and day out 
And fight those demons day in and day out 
Day in and day out, day in and day out 
Day in and day out, day in and day out

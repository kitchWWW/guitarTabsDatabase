As I was walking down the street one day,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
I saw a house on fire,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
There was a man standing at an upper storey window[/tab]
[tab]                                                      [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch] 
Shouting and screaming to the crowd that was gathered there below,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
For he was sore afraid,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Jump, you mucker, Jump,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em7[/ch]                                      [ch]A[/ch]
Jump into this â€˜ere blanket what we are holding,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]Em7[/ch] [ch]D/F#[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
And you will be alright.",[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
He jumped, hit the deck, broke his bloody neck,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]   [ch]Em7[/ch] [ch]D/F#[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
There was no blanket.[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Laugh, we nearly shat,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em7[/ch]
We have not laughed so much since grandma died,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
Or Aunty Mable caught her left one in the mangle,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]Em7[/ch] [ch]D/F#[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
We are miserable sinners, Fiiiiiiiiilthy muckers.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Amen[/tab]

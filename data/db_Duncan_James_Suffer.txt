 From a moment that lingered too long [/tab]

To a battle that can never be won [/tab]

It's a love we don't need [/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Let's sit here in silence [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am7[/ch]
Let out hearts bleed [/tab]
That it's hard to be strong

So here we are [/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G/F#[/ch]
Standing in an empty room [/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm trying not to look at you [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G/F#[/ch]
That way [/tab]

Cause I care [/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]G/F#[/ch] 
Thought it's hurting me so much inside [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm trying just to be your friend today [/tab]

Bridge

[tab]                                        [ch]F[/ch]
It's a race that should have never been run [/tab]

Interlude
[tab]                      [ch]Eb[/ch]
If we can't share the highs [/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Bb[/ch]
Might as well share the pain [/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Eb[/ch]
I k now it's breaking every rule [/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
But it helps ease the strain [/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Am/G[/ch]
I'd rather sit here in sorrow [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
Again and again [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
In the arms of one another's suffering [/tab]

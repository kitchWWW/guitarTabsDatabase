DROP D TUNING
Intro:
[ch]D2[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]A2[/ch] [ch]C2[/ch] [ch]G2[/ch]  (continue throughout verse)

[tab]   [ch]D2[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]A2[/ch]  [ch]C2[/ch]       [ch]G2[/ch]
      Shooting star you   breathe in me[/tab]
      Follow through to this glorious room of you and me
      The boy sat down a little bit scared to breathe
      I feel something near to me so are you
      And why do I feel things near to me
      And I cry inside because suddenly I'm free

[tab][ch]Csus4[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]Csus4[/ch]
      I've been there before, and I'm not going back[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]B2[/ch]   [ch]G2[/ch]
      I need you more now that I can see... you now[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]D2[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]A2[/ch]  [ch]C2[/ch]       [ch]G2[/ch]
      He raised his hands and bitterness leaves [/tab]
      The blood he sees is the blood he needs
      And how can I receive this love you have... I need
      This is all I have you're all that's left in me

      I never felt this before now I'm leaning against you[/tab]

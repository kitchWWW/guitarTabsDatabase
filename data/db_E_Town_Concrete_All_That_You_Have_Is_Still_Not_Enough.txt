[Intro]

[ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]


[Verse 1]

[tab]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
Basically I was just born-a-bastard, long for greener pastures[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
I am a phoenix, I was born from the ashes[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]
The form you take in the storm is what you makes strong[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]
Anybody could perform like a charm when the waters calm[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
Ya'll don't know nay-thing about the things I've been faced with[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
Can ya'll relate how I came from the basement?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
I make the music and the same time faced it[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
I've been so close to my dreams I can taste it[/tab]


[Bridge]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                                  [ch]Em[/ch]
Come on and punish me, the only thing that keeps me sane[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
I look to you for things I can not change[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                   [ch]Em[/ch]
I need your blessing, do you approve?[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
My best was never good enough for you[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
So this is how it feels and it doesn't feel so good[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
To know you couldn't give enough after giving all you could[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
It's been raining for so long its like the sun will never shine[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]
I've been losing for so long, I think I fell too far behind[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]Bm[/ch]
       Far behind[/tab]
[ch]A[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
I've swam beneath the icy waters, not coming up for air[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
I've spent my whole life living for those who didn't even care[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
So this is how it feels and it doesn't feel so good[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
To know you couldn't give enough after giving all you could[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
It's been raining for so long its like the sun will never shine[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]

[ch]A[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]


[Verse 3]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
I sat and thought for a while today[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
I got depressed and put the smiles away, 'cause I've been struggling[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                         [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
Since back in my childhood days, I've been walkin' since forever still I'm miles away[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]                                          [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
Maybe ya'll never forgave for my wilder days even though now Im more wise in my ways[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]
Im losing faith in myself. Sometimes I doubt I'll even make it myself[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]
Whose gonna give it to me, if I don't take it myself?[/tab]


[Bridge]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                                  [ch]Em[/ch]
Come on and punish me, the only thing that keeps me sane[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
I look to you for things I can not change[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                   [ch]Em[/ch]
I need your blessing, do you approve?[/tab]

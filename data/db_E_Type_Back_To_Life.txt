[And it goes for the whole song]



When you hit me with a beat I'm back to life
When you get up on your feet I'm so alive
Cause tonight became a party by surprise
Baby don't you know you bring me back to life

Yeah, you make me believe it, (you make me believe it)
You make me believe it all the way
Yeah, you make me believe it, (you make me believe it)
You make me believe it all the way

When you hit me with a beat I'm back to life
When you get up on your feet I'm so alive
Cause tonight became a party by surprise
Baby don't you know you bring me back to life

Yeah, you make me believe it, (you make me believe it)
You make me believe it all the way
Yeah, you make me believe it, (you make me believe it)
You make me believe it all the way

So, thinking 'bout the clock
It doesn't matter now
See all that really matters is the sound
Of you and you and I exploding like a bomb
Now let me buy another round yeah

You gotta feel it, you gotta live it, woah
And if you live it, you gotta love it, woah
And if you love it, you gonna feel it
And it goes round and round again

When you hit me with a beat I'm back to life
When you get up on your feet I'm so alive
Cause tonight became a party by surprise
Baby don't you know you bring me back to life

Yeah, you make me believe it, (you make me believe it)
You make me believe it all the way
Yeah, you make me believe it, (you make me believe it)
You make me believe it all the way

When you hit me with a beat I'm back to life
When you get up on your feet I'm so alive
Cause tonight became a party by surprise
Baby don't you know you bring me back to life

Yeah, you make me believe it, (you make me believe it)
You make me believe it all the way
Yeah, you make me believe it, (you make me believe it)
You make me believe it all the way

Tonight became a party, party, party, party
Tonight became a party, party, party
Tonight became a party, party, party, party
Tonight became a party, party, party, party

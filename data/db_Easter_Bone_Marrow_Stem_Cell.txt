[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
At the bone marrow stem cell convention I was feeling pretty low[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
You had told me it's over because you need time to grow[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
I was dealing with this new information in the old way that you know[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
Breaking chairs, clearing bars, ruining lives and wasting chances as I go[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
Many things I tend to like just exactly 'cause they're soft[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
Then there's another few things that I love because they're hard like rock[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                                    [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
You know I loved your teeth, I felt their structure many times with my tongue[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                                [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
You know I loved your teeth bеcause I kept complimenting your gums[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]Dm[/ch]
But wе all know[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
One day my teeth[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
Will chew right through your bones[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
One day my teeth[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
Will chew right through your bones[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
One day my teeth[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
Will chew right through your bones[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
One day my teeth[/tab]

Will chew right through your bones[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]                                        [ch]Bb[/ch]                                 [ch]Gm[/ch]
When I'd been sucking at your ankles in June the bruises stayed for over a month[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                                         [ch]Bb[/ch]                                 [ch]Gm[/ch]
There's the thing with bruises: if they're good you would prefer them to hold on[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]                                [ch]Bb[/ch]                                [ch]Gm[/ch]
There's a bruise I kept with me, you'd been biting at my breast and there was blood[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]                                      [ch]Gm[/ch]
A blue breast for brunch with my friends, something to tell them we were hot[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]                       [ch]Gm[/ch]
I like to think you could white knuckle your body like how you make a fist[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]Bb[/ch]                                [ch]Gm[/ch]
I love the prominent bone on your chest, I like to push you down by it[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                               [ch]Bb[/ch]                              [ch]Gm[/ch]
The thought we're just two skeletons wrestling in our bloody bags of skin[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm[/ch]                                       [ch]Bb[/ch]                               [ch]Gm[/ch]
We've been so close, we've been so open; now that it's done I wanna live the bruise you been[/tab]



[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]Dm[/ch]
But wе all know[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
One day my teeth[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
Will chew right through your bones[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
One day my teeth[/tab]

Will chew right through your bones[/tab]

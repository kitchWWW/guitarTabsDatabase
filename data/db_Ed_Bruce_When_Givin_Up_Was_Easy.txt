[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]
In a one bedroom apartment we were sleepin' on the floor[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]F[/ch]
It must have crossed your mind that there surely must be more[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G/B[/ch]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
For all the times you must have wondered if we'd ever make it through[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm7[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
The only words I've heard you say were "Honey, I love you"[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]F/C[/ch]
We were barely holdin' on to the life we tried to make[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]F/C[/ch]
And God I used to wonder how much more you could take[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Through it all you held on to our dreams so desperately[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm7[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
When tomorrow seemed so far away, you stood so close by me[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
When givin' up was easy, you never did give in[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm7[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
You proved how much you love me time and time again[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]G/F[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
For all the times you could have gone you stayed around but then[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]       [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
When givin' up was easy, you ne-ver did give in[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]F/C[/ch]
Now the diamonds on your fingers, how they sparkle in the light[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]F/C[/ch]
But the fire of love inside you is still burning just as bright[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G/B[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
Though time has dimmed the memory of how it was before[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Yesterday I needed you - today I need you more[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
When givin' up was easy, you never did give in[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm7[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
You proved how much you love me time and time again[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]G/F[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
For all the times you could have gone you stayed around but then[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]       [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G/B[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]
When givin' up was easy, you ne-ver did give in[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]Dm7[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
When givin' up was easy you never did give in[/tab]

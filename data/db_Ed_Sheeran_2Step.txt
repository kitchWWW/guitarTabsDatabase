[Intro]
[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]
I had a bad week[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
You know you take all of my stress right down[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Help me get it off my chest and out[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]Bm[/ch]
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
We forget that we're here right now[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's got to change[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
I think maybe you and me[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays[/tab]

And then


[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
We'll go all night[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Two-steppin' with the woman I love[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Bm[/ch]
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm on your eyes, electrified[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone and loved[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                          N.C.
And all we need is us to go all[/tab]


[Post-Chorus]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Night, night[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Two-steppin' with the woman I love[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]
Night, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
All we need is us[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
What do you reckon, is it just me?[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]Bm[/ch]
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
If you don't see it, you should trust me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
I feel like I've got nothin' left right now[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Except this beauty in her dress right now[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
She got me feelin' like the best and the rest are just less[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Then she needs, so we press play and step to the beat[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's got to change[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]               N.C.
Head out to the place where it plays and[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
We'll go all night[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Two-steppin' with the woman I love[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Bm[/ch]
All my troubles turn to nothing, when I'm on your eyes, electrified[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone and loved[/tab]

[Post-Chorus]

Night, night[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]
I had a bad week[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
You know you take all of my stress right down[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Help me get it off my chest and out[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
We forget that we're here right now[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's got to change[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
I think maybe you and me[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays[/tab]

And then


[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
We'll go all night[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Two-steppin' with the woman I love[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
All my troubles turnin' up and when I'm on your eyes, electrified[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone and loved[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                          N.C.
And all we need is us to go all[/tab]


[Post-Chorus]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Night, night[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Two-steppin' with the woman I love[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
Night, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
All we need is us[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
Baby[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Sun comin' up when we walk out, we lost the track of time[/tab]
[tab]                                               [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Everything that I been dealin' with ain't even crossed my mind[/tab]
[tab]                                                 [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
I don't see nobody in here but us, for real, for you I'm blind[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]D[/ch]
We go anywhere, it don't take much for us to catch a vibe[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                             [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Come here, I need to tell you something, which way is your ear[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]                                        [ch]D[/ch]

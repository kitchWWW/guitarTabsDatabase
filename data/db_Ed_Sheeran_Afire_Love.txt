Capo 3rd Fret

[Intro]
[ch]Bm[/ch] | [ch]G[/ch] | [ch]Em[/ch] | [ch]A[/ch] 
[ch]Bm[/ch] | [ch]G[/ch] | [ch]Em[/ch] | [ch]A[/ch]
[ch]D[/ch]  | [ch]G[/ch] | [ch]Em[/ch] | [ch]A[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
Things were all good yesterday [/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
And then the devil took your memory [/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And if you fell to your death today, [/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Bm[/ch]
I hope that heaven is your resting place [/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                    [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] 
then that could've been the medicine[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]A[/ch] 
And now you're lying in the bed again[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
And my father told me son[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
And you're not the only one[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
Although my grandma used to say, he used to sing[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
And we'll lie inside, a little while here, oh [/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
And we're wrapped in light, in life and love[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Put your open lips on mine, slowly let them shut[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
for they're designed to be together oh[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
And we'll set alight, we're afire love[/tab]

[tab]                                      [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
And then the devil took your breath away[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
And now we're left here in pain [/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
Black suit black tie standing in the rain[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] 
And now my family is one again [/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]A[/ch]
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Six years old I remember when [/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
And my father told me son[/tab]

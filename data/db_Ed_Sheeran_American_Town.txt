[Verse 1]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
We're a long way from home[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Haven't seen you in so long[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
But it all came back in one moment[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
And the year started cold[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
But I didn't notice at all[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
And when we found there's a room we're both in[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
We get Chinese food in small white boxes[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
 Live the life we saw in Friends[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Your room, it barely fits the mattress[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 Wake up, leave for work again[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
The wind, it seems to blow right through us[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
 Down jackets are the trend[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
The rush, we're rushing deep into love[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
English girl in an American town[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
No elevator to the fifth floor[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]F[/ch]
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I wish time would freeze[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
Feet are three feet off the ground[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]F[/ch]
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
It's just you and me[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
My English girl in an American town[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
In an American town[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Days come and go[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
But it ends windows closed[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                       
And the scent of your perfume's on me[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
You're useless with your phone[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Electric when one-on-one[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
I thought I would be more nervous, darlin'[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
We watch comedies and miss the endings[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
 Conversations till the dawn[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
Any change in tide, we push against it[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 Challenge meanings in the songs[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
And head out without a reservation[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
 Drinkin' out of paper bags[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And wasting time is time not wasted[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                           [ch]C[/ch]
For my English girl in an American town[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
No elevator to the fifth floor[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]F[/ch]
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I wish time would freeze[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
Feet are three feet off the ground[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]F[/ch]
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
It's just you and me[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Dm[/ch]
My English girl in an American town[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]                      [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
And when our eyes are closed together, I can't explain[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]Dm[/ch]
How the scent of your perfume takes me to a higher place[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
We can watch it unfold or we can change how it takes[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
And rebuild when it breaks down[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
We drink Moscow Mules and steal the cups[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
From, mostly the Bowery bar[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
What a perfect day to fall in love on[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 What a way to make a start[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
And it appears, when you think all is lost[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
 Then, you don't remember when it started[/tab]

Never have to pretend


[Chorus]
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]
With my English girl in an American town[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
No elevator to the fifth floor[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]F[/ch]
I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I wish time would freeze[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
Feet are three feet off the ground[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]F[/ch]
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
It's just you and me[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
English girl in an American town[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
No elevator to the fifth floor[/tab]

I'll ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I wish time would freeze[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out[/tab]

Feet are three feet off the ground[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]F[/ch]
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found[/tab]

It's just you and me[/tab]

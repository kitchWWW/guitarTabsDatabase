Artist: Edens Edge
Song: Amen
Genre: 
Key: 


So I looked over all of the tabs for this song, and couldn't find one that sounded 
exactly right. I figured I'd try to figure it out, with some help from youtube 
singer Danielle Lowe ---- > http://www.youtube.com/user/DLSings
She has a video up of that song, and had the chords she used posted in a comment. 
I used them, and they're pretty much correct. Just adding the rest like the intro 
and that extra stuff to complete it. :) Enjoy

Capo 3
 
Intro D. You can alternate between D Dsus2 and Dsus4 just by hearing the melody.

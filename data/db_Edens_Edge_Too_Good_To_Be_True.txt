[tab][ch]B[/ch]
You walked in shining brighter than a headlight[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F#[/ch]
 Turning every head like a diamond in a coal mine[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
 Packing more punch than a Mississippi fist fight[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]B[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]
 Oh oh my my[/tab]
 
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Walked my way, took my hand, said "Let's go"[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F#[/ch]
 Had more game than the Mandalay Casino[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
 Thought I hit the jackpot, I was on a good roll[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]B[/ch]
 Shows you what I know[/tab]
 
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]
Too good to be true[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]B[/ch]
 Like diamonds on the soles of my shoes[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m[/ch]
 Like money falling outta the blue[/tab]
  
 Don't be fooled
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
 He ain't nothing but too good to be real[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]B[/ch]
 Don't believe the way he's making you feel[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m[/ch]
 He'll break your pretty little heart in two[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F#[/ch]
 Momma told me 'bout boys like you[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]B[/ch]
 Too good to be true[/tab]

 
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Before I knew it my heartstrings unwound[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F#[/ch]
 I fell faster than a cannonball straight down[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]
 Everybody talking all over this town[/tab]
  A (let ring)
 "Look there he goes again"

 
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Lie lie lied like a politician[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#[/ch]
 Shoulda read the headlines, paid more attention[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
 To my suspicions, my intuition[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
 I shoulda listened[/tab]

 

[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
Too good to be true[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]B[/ch]

[tab]                 [ch]B[/ch]
 Too good to be true[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]B[/ch] 
I shoulda seen it from a mile away[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C#m[/ch]
I should have called a spade a spade[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F#[/ch]
 I shoulda known that you're...[/tab]

GIVE MY LOVE (English Version)
by Edward Chun

Hello! I am here to share my third guitar chords that I originally made. I was looking
the chords of this song, but I can't find even one. The only thing I found was the piano
so I decided to make mine by ears. This is the easiest and most fitted sound I can ever 
for this song, and I really tried my best for this, so I hope you'll like it. But,
you have any suggestions to make it better, please e-mail me in 
Thanks and enjoy! =D

=Just repeat the Chords used in 1st CHORUS=

CHORUS 2:
Now I’ll give my love oh when I hold you tight
Give my love through kisses oh so bright
And you know that I won’t change my love
Take my love all through the night…


=SOLO=
You can just use the INTRO Chords for this. I can't discover the right tabs/chords for
part yet. However, I'll try if I can. But, for now, just repeat the intro.


CHORUS 3:
Now I’ll give my love oh when I hold you tight
Give my love through kisses oh so bright
And you know that time won’t change my love
Take my love all through the night…

CHORUS 4:
I’ll give my love oh when I hold you tight
Give my love, through kisses oh so bright
And you know that I can’t change my love
Take my love all through the night…

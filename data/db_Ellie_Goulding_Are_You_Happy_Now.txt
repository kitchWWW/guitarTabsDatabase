[tab]  [ch]Gm[/ch]                                    
I saw your picture in the paper today.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
I didn't know the eyes, but I recognized your face.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Gm[/ch]
I read what you're doing and doing it in style.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                                                        [ch]C[/ch]
Last year I might have cried, but tonight I'll try to smile.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Gm[/ch]
Are you happy now? [/tab]


[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                    
I let your birthday pass, [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]
I met your friends at last,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
I didn't even ask[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Gm[/ch]
If you're happy now.[/tab]


[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]              
I barely made each night[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]
Somehow the days rolled by.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
The part that loved you died,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Gm[/ch]
Are you happy now?[/tab]


[tab]  [ch]Gm[/ch]
I saw you walking in the rain and holding no one's hand.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                                         [ch]C[/ch]
I started feeling things that I couldn't understand.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Gm[/ch]
Now you're swinging from my heart, I'm ringing up my friends.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                                                [ch]C[/ch]
"Before it all begins," they say, " remember how it ends".[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Gm[/ch]
Are you happy now?[/tab]


[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                        
I let your birthday pass, [/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]
I met your friends at last,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]

[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
The part that loved you died,[/tab]

Are you happy now?[/tab]

You're swinging from my heart, I'm ringing up my friends.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]Gm[/ch]
And are you happy now?[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
 I just want to be around you[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
 Is that too much to ask?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            
 I just want to be around you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
 Is that too much to ask?[/tab]


[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 When I look into your eyes[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
 Boy, I'm feeling delirious[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
 But you know this is serious[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
 I'm sticking to you like glue[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 Only see you now and then[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
 but I know we could have it all[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
 Because before I was cynical, [/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
 baby you were just cool[/tab]


[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                           
 I just want to be around you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                         
 Is that too much to ask?[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
 Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch] 
 Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                           
 I just want to be around you[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]                       
 Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be, I could be, [/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
 I could be there, if only you’d let me in, [/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]
 I could be there, just tell me where and tell me when[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
 So tired of these roads going nowhere[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
 But I know your love takes me somewhere [/tab]


[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                           
 Still looking up and down [/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
 while you're being mysterious[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
 I see really big things for us[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
 We just need to break through, break through, break through[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 Everything that you say[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
 God I wish I had said it first[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
 And forgetting I had ever hurt[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
 Your love is pulling me through, me through, me through[/tab]

[tab]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]

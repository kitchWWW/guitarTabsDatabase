[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] (x2)

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Listen,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
I can hear a voice[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
I need a helping hand[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
just to beat the void[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
I need a mission[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
a dream to stop me talking to myself[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
and now the silence is broken[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
and my soul is to sell[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
I need to pick up the pieces[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
to scatter to the wind[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
hold the city to your ears[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
and you can hear the wind come in[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
But you can't change the world with a song[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
and you can't make it right when it's wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
I cannot stop this music travelling round with me wherever I go[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
it's playing for you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
I cannot stop the voice unravelling round me whatever I do[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
it's talking to you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
The world dances to the rhythm of its own[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
heart beating for you however you lose[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
So speak to me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
believe believe believe me[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
Don't let it slip through your fingertips[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
When there's a ghost[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
don't try to reason with it[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Because now I'm tired I'm wired[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
so I will not miss a thing[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
I rope my words out to dry[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
and I've forgotten what to sing[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
But you can't change the world with a song[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
and you can't make it right when it's wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]

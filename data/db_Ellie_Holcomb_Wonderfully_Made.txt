[Verse 1]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                                            [ch]C[/ch]
It's two in the morning and I'm still awake in my bed[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                                                   [ch]C[/ch]
And I can't shake these lies that keep running around in my head[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
What if I saw me the way that you see me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
What if I believed it was true[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
What if I traded this shame and self-hatred[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
For a chance at believing you[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
That you knit me together in my mother's womb[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
And you say that I've never been hidden from you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
And you say that I'm wonderfully, wonderfully made[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
You search me and know me[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]
You know when I sit, when I rise[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                                                [ch]C[/ch]
So you must know the choices I've made and the pain that I hide[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
What if I saw me the way that you see me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
What if I believed it was true[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
What if I traded this shame and self-hatred[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
For a chance at believing you[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause you knit me together in my mother's womb[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
And you say that I've never been hidden from you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
And you say that I'm wonderfully, wonderfully made[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Your eyes, they have seen me before I was born[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
And you know all the good things that you made me for[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
And you say that I'm wonderfully, wonderfully made[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
When I consider the heavens above[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
Oh what is man that you're mindful of us[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
'Til you say that we're wonderfully, wonderfully made[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
And you promise that you'll never leave me, Oh Lord[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
Oh that you hem me in, both behind and before[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
And I'm wonderfully, wonderfully made[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
And you knit me together in my mother's womb[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
And you say that I've never been hidden from you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
And you say that I'm wonderfully, wonderfully made[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
And your eyes, they have seen me before I was born[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
And you know all the good things that you made me for[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]

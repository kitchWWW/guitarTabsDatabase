[1st verse]

[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
Come back to what you know,[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
Take everything, real slow,[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
I wanna lose you but I can't,[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
Let you go.[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Before you interfere,[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]       
Let me make it loud and clear,[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
that you got no more to prove.[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
I'm the fool.[/tab]


[bridge]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]
So take it easy, on yourself,[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]
There's nothing new about, declaring how you felt.[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
I'll never let you down,[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
Or ever feel the way that I've been fearing now.[/tab]


[chorus]

[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Coming back to what you know won't mean a thing.[/tab]

[tab]                         [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
Everything that you've done keeps you from me.[/tab]

[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Now I know that I need more time,[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]
Come back and let me see your eye.[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
I'm coming back to what you know,[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
Cos I know that I need it now it's gone.[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
Now I know that I need more time,[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
Come back and let me see your eye.[/tab]


[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                   
So hang on to what you've got,[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
keep it safe.[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]
Hang on to what you've got,[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]   
keep it safe from harm.[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
You'll find.[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch] 
There's nothing new that we can't leave behind.[/tab]


[2nd verse]

Come back to what you know,
Take everything, real slow,
I wanna lose you but I got,
Far too high.
To let go,
Now the demon in me knows,
What I knew so long ago.

[chorus]

Coming back to what you know won't mean a thing.
Everything that you've done keeps you from me.
Now I know that I need more time,
Come back and let me see your eye.
I'm coming back to what you know,
Cos I know that I need it now it's gone.
Now I know that I need more time,
Come back and let me see your eye.

So hang on to what you've got,
keep it safe.
Hang on to what you've got,
keep it safe from harm.
We got time.
We got time.

Coming back to what you know won't mean a thing.
Everything that you've done keeps you from me.
Now I know that I need more time,
Come back and let me see your eye.
I'm coming back to what you know,
Cos I know that I need it now it's gone.
Now I know that I need more time,
Come back and let me see your eye.


[outro - same chords as verse]

Come back to what you know,
Take everything, real slow,
I tried to lose you,
But I got,
far too close.

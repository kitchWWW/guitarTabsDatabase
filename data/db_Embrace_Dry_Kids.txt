Dry Kids by Embrace.
Written by Danny McNamara
Chorded by Tim Bates


This is a B-side on the One Big Family EP and I reckon it's better than the A-side... anyway see what you think....

The pattern for the verse goes like this:

[ch]D[/ch], [ch]A[/ch], [ch]Bm[/ch], [ch]G[/ch]

Then for the chorus (what there is of it) the pattern is:

[ch]D[/ch] [ch]F#m[/ch], [ch]Em[/ch], [ch]G[/ch]

Anyway you should be able to pick up the pattern along with the CD... here are the lyrics to go along with it....


We're dry kids, there's nothing you've got I want
are you gonna leave
So you keep it locked in, we murder each other every day
knowing we'd never be crow-barred apart

And we tried, for so long
to reach eleven on a scale of one to ten
but we never get so far

I'm done, you're out of my system learning how to live
with how it feels

And we tried, for so long
to reach eleven on a scale of one to ten
but we never get so far

Me and you, should have never left from the start
Me and you should have never got this far.

Well enough to measure[/tab]
[tab]	  [ch]C[/ch]
That it couldn't last forever[/tab]

Words I keep repeating[/tab]

Judge me like a stone[/tab]

Skim the surface of the real wrong[/tab]

Just because you're old to me[/tab]

With limits we know nothing of[/tab]

And I, won't be keeping score[/tab]

As you wave goodbye[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]

It's for when we try[/tab]

And I, know my luck is covered up in lies[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Why did you run I'll always let you leave[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
You aren't the first to hit and run away from me[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
As i bounce along the open road[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I'm outnumbered and alone...[/tab]

[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
And though we could have made it last[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
You've gotta do more than that[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
You've got to take all you have and pour and pour[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
You're never gonna see the light[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
You've gotta leave now behind[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
You're never gonna know what's right from what went wrong[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
So ignore all the facts[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
And come running straight back to me to me[/tab]

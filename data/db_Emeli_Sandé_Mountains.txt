intro
He said I'm going to have a bed with lots of pillows
And that we're going to build a house with lots of windows

I'd never work these hours if I didn't love you
My hands are always red and sunshine I sleep through
If you say we're going to move somewhere with neighbours less crazy
You know I'm going to be there, because I trust my baby


Yeah we'll climb mountains
Climb mountains together
Yeah we'll climb mountains
Climb mountains together


I keep my fingers crossed that we're going to be able
I touch the wood for luck, on our broken table
I know that it's our heart that's going to save us
If we never come back how can they blame us?


Yeah we'll climb mountains
Climb mountains together
Yeah we'll climb mountains
Climb mountains together


Yeah we'll climb mountains
Climb mountains together
Yeah we'll climb mountains
Climb mountains together


Enjoy :)

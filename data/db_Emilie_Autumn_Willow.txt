[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Willow, weep for me [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
Bow your tallest tree [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
Down to the infamous hands [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Of someone no one understands [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
I'm not unique in this [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
It's based on none but my mistake[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]
At night I lie awake [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Thinking of all the hearts I'd happily break [/tab]

[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]
It's cruel, I know [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
At least they tell me so [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Well someone lock me up and throw away the key [/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Because I'm not ashamed, oh no [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, willow [/tab]

[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
That I only write love songs [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
To those whom I don't love [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
I only reach for him [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Who's tied to someone else's glove [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
That which I hold inside [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Which I admire and deride [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Which I protect and hide is yours [/tab]

[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Willow, weep for me [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Don't think I don't see[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]
This life I'm living in two[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
But still it's something I must do[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
I'm not unique in this [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
Nor am I special, sweet or kind [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]
I court a thousand smiles [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Yet I keep my own to hide behind[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]
It's cruel I know [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
At least they tell me so [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Well someone lock me up and throw away the key [/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Because I'm not ashamed, oh no [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, willow [/tab]

[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
That I only write love songs [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
To those whom I don't love [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
I only reach for him [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Who's tied to someone else's glove [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
That which I hold inside [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Which I admire and deride [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Which I protect and hide is yours[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Slander and dissention [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
They're parlour games to me [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Papers overrun with lies too mad to mention [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
You say they never hurt you [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
No consequence, I'm happy [/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
We're much too far above it all [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
But oh no, that's not true [/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]Em[/ch]
These wicked pastimes take their toll [/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Am[/ch]
These tyrant vices break your soul [/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
Deliver me from all I am [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
And all I never want to be [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I love you (Oh willow, willow, willow)[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
Doubt me not [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
Rewrite this plot for all to see [/tab]


[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
And I only write love songs [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
To those whom I don't love [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
I only reach for him [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Who's tied to someone else's glove [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
That which I hold inside [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Which I admire and deride [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Which I protect and hide is yours[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Bend your branches to the ground and hold me close [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Let me harmonize with all thatâ€™s good in you [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Share your sympathy and weep for me [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]
Oh, willow, heal the hearts I've broken [/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Make me pure and start my song anew [/tab]

[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
For I only write love songs [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
To those whom I don't love [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
I only reach for him [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Who's tied to someone else's glove [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
That which I hold inside [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Which I admire and deride [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Which I protect and hide is yours[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
Is yours, is yours[/tab]

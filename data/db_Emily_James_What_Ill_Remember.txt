[Verse 1]
[tab]                         [ch]Bm[/ch]
Wish you could take my hand[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
I wouldn’t take your touch for granted[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Cuz now I feel how bad it hurts not to have it[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm7[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Although goodnights turned to goodbyes[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
Doesn’t change the love that was[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm7[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
All the memories when it’s ending[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
They come rushing back at once[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Like when we were driving through the canyon you and me All[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm7[/ch]
Singin’ to Stevie[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Bm[/ch]
Changing words all out of key[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
It didn’t matter[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Asus4[/ch]
We were happy ever after[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
At least that’s what I’ll remember[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]Bm7[/ch]
All alone[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
So cold here in the silence[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]Bm7[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Didn’t know my world could change in a minute[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm7[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
All the memories when it’s ending oh they all come rushing back[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm7[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Asus[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
It’s so heavy in the present so I’ll hold on to the past[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Like when we were driving through the canyon you and me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm7[/ch]
Singin’ to Stevie[/tab]

Changing words all out of key
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]

At least that’s what I’ll remember[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Like wearing your sweatshirt and rolling up the sleeves[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bm7[/ch]
Watching old movies until we fell asleep[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
All of it mattered[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]
We had happy ever after[/tab]

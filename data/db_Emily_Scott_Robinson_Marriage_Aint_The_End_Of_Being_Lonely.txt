Genre: 
Key: G


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I thought I fell in love when I was eighteen[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
With you cruising Main Street dreaming up our lives[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
We had bigger plans than staying there in Jackson[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Come summertime I made a pretty bride[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
We got married in the Baptist church on State Street[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]
No daddy there to walk me down the aisle[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
My mama never could pin down a good man[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
So I swore to God that we would do things right[/tab]


[Chorus 1]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
But marriage ain't the end of being lonely[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Sometimes it feels like it's the start[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
'Cause the years keep rolling on[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]
And all I know for sure[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
There's so many little ways to break a heart[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Well our demons didn't take too long to show up[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Turns out, when I drink I like to fight[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
And then you'd leave the house and wouldn't tell me[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
Where you went to ease your sorrows late at night[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
And we fought for three whole days when I got pregnant[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Where I disappeared to, no one knew[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
When I came home, I carried myself different[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
It was all the growing up I had to do[/tab]


[Chorus 2]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause marriage ain't the end of being lonely[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Sometimes it feels like it's the start[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
The years keep rolling on[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]
And all I know for sure[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
There's so many ways your world can fall apart[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Well, we can't hide our claws, our teeth, our anger[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
The fire's hot and this could last all night[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
The air is thick with things we haven't said yet[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
But we're saving them for when they burn just right[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And I hang on to suffering like it's a winning hand[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Waiting my turn to cash it all in[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
And how we stayed together I'll never understand[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Some days I think that God is up there laughing at my plans[/tab]


[Chorus 3]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause marriage ain't the end of being lonely[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Sometimes it feels like it's the start[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
The years keep rolling on[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]
And all I know for sure[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
There's so many little ways to break a heart[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
The years keep rolling on[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]
And all I know for sure[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]  
There's so many ways your world can fall apart[/tab]

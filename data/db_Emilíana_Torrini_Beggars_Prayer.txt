Song: Beggars Prayer
Genre: 
Key: 


I hope this okay, my first chords, I've only been playing guitar a few weeks and I 
just noticed that this BEAUTIFUL song was not up. So, here. 
It's very very easy, just play each chord once when indicated, the voice on this 
track is the strongest/most important thing anyway.

Mama said lift your head from the sieve of your hands[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Mama say eventually, this hurting will end[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch] 
But the shockwaves on my bones will linger[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch] 
Like the ghost of you here in my bed[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
When I was lost you thought me a beautiful find[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]Em[/ch] 
Sometimes I think of you sleeping, so sleep for a while[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch] 
I find myself asking who'd do this to love[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
And the white shouldered mountains, they pointed above[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]      
Lord you just dropped me here my the side of this road[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]
Out here's too cold and I don't want to walk it alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]  
I've got a bottle of your blood inside me[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]
And an old beggar's prayer on the tip of my tongue[/tab]

[ch]C[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] x2

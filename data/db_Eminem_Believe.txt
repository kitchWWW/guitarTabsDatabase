[Verse 1]
[tab]      [ch]C#m[/ch]
And I started from the bottom[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch]
Like a snowman, ground-up[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C#m[/ch]                           [ch]G#m[/ch]
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]C#m[/ch]
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (get it?)[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G#m[/ch]
Sucker free, confidence high[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C#m[/ch]
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G#m[/ch]
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (yeah)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
    Another day in the life (uh)[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
    Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
    Now my community's gated and I[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
    Made it and my neighbours say hi (say hi)[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]G#m[/ch]
  I'm givin' 'em pounds,   I'm upscale now[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bsus4[/ch]
     Guess it means I'm way in the sky (way in the sky)[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]               [ch]C#m[/ch]
  But I still remember the days of[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G#m[/ch]
Minimum wage for general labour[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
    Welfare recipient since a minor[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
Look how government assistance has made ya[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                [ch]G#m[/ch]
   Adversity, if at first you don't succeed[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bsus4[/ch]
      Put your temper to more use[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
'Cause   bein' broke's a poor excuse[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
That should only give you more fuel[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G#m[/ch]
Show 'em why you're you[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C#m[/ch]
So close, God, it's like I almost got it[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G#m[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G#m[/ch]
So I Unabomb shit, tick, tick, tick, no remorse, pew[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bsus4[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C#m[/ch]
That's why they call me firecracker[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G#m[/ch]
I grew up on WIC, wick, wick, wick, with a short fuse[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]               [ch]G#m[/ch]
     I got some important news to report to[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]G#m[/ch]
  Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bsus4[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]C#m[/ch]
Do you still believe in me?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]G#[/ch]
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]B[/ch]
And walk out, I will never let you live it down[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]C#m[/ch]
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]
Man, I know sometimes[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G#m[/ch]
These thoughts can    be harsh and cold as ice[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C#m[/ch]
To me they're just ink blots[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G#m[/ch]
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m[/ch]
So you might wanna think it over twice (yeah)[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G#m[/ch]
Or you retards can roll the dice[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C#m[/ch]
But beef will at least cost you your career[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G#m[/ch]
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]      [ch]G#m[/ch]
     But this middle finger's free as a bird[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                  [ch]G#m[/ch]
     Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]G#m[/ch]                          [ch]Bsus4[/ch]
  Too short for the verse,   studied his formula, learned[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]B[/ch]
How to incorporate a curse[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]C#m[/ch]
Point it towards corporate America[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G#m[/ch]
Stick a fork in and turn[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C#m[/ch]
'Cause four-letter words are more    better heard[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G#m[/ch]
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch] [ch]G#m[/ch]                         [ch]C#m[/ch]
       But sometimes I overdo it,   but I just get so into it[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch]
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
When your situation showed no improvement[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch]
I was that door, you walked over to it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bsus4[/ch]
      I'm the light at the end of tunnel[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]B[/ch]
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
     When that tunnel vision is unclear[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
Shit becomes too much to bear[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
     Since "Cleanin' Out My Closet"[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G#m[/ch]
When I was havin' trouble with the snare[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]G#m[/ch]
  I'm that unrealistic prayer    answered[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Bsus4[/ch]                             [ch]B[/ch]
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]C#m[/ch]
When you struggle with despair[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G#m[/ch]
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bsus4[/ch]                                      [ch]B[/ch]
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your fuckin' switch, nothin' can compare[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]C#m[/ch]
Do you still believe in me?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]G#[/ch]
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]B[/ch]
And walk out, I will never let you live it down[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]C#m[/ch]
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
    Started from the bottom like a snowman[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
    Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
    But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C#m[/ch]
And I know that I always got Proof at my back[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m[/ch]
I called you "Proof" because I knew for a fact[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
  My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]B[/ch]
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so[/tab]
Give me that inkling and mo-


[Verse 3]
[tab]   [ch]C#m[/ch]
'Tivation to go, Hussein with the flow[/tab]
Fake fans left you two-faced at the show
[tab]    [ch]C#m[/ch]
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul[/tab]
Layin' vocals two days in a row
[tab]     [ch]C#m[/ch]
True statement, hate to go down this road[/tab]
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
[tab]     [ch]C#m[/ch]
So I walk in this bitch with loose change[/tab]
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
    But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m/A[/ch]
      That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?[/tab]
Use the tools you're given
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
  Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt[/tab]
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
  I used to play the loser/victim[/tab]
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
     I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet[/tab]
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
[tab]                 [ch]C#m[/ch]
Fanny packs, hourglasses[/tab]
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
     Man, in my younger days[/tab]
That dream was so much fun to chase
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
     It's like I'd run in place[/tab]
While this shit dangled in front of my face
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
     But how do you keep up the pace[/tab]
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
  When that dual exhaust is coolin' off[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]B[/ch]
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all[/tab]
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de gr√¢ce
[tab]                   [ch]C#m[/ch]
Still you feel the need to go full tilt[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]C#m[/ch]
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill[/tab]
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
[tab]               [ch]C#m[/ch]
Do you still believe?[/tab]

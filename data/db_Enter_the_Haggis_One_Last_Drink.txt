[Intro] (Acapella)
N.C.
I've had a life that's full
Everyone's been good to me
So fire up that fiddle, boy
And give me one last drink
When the sun comes up
I will leave without a fight
The world is mine tonight

[Verse 2]
Took young Molly by the hand
Spun her 'round and back again
Clicked his heels, bowed his head
Never a tear in his eye
Carried on 'til five

Won't you raise a glass to the dear departed ones[/tab]

[Verse 3]
The room was full of all his friends
Never a funeral, this was the end
They drank to all who lent their hand
Everyone drank to John
Raised a glass and said

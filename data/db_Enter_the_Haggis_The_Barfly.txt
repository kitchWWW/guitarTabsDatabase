[Verse 1]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
I met an old man one night in a bar[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
He was sitting alone[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
The way men his age always are[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
His movements were slow[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
Didn't speak very well[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]
But every old man has a story to tell[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Every old man has a story to tell[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
He lived by the book[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Went to church every day[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
His wife left him young[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
With two daughters and bills to pay[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
He worked himself hard[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
And the years flickered past[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
His girls kept him young but they grew up so fast[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
His girls kept him young but they grew up so fast[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Prodigal Faith always felt second best[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
When she turned seventeen[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
She took her coat and her camera And headed west[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
It broke her dad's heart[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
But as he likes to say[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
With enough time apart even Faith fades away[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]

[tab] [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Jenny met Ray in his last days ashore[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
They married in May[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
And that August he joined the war[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
He said Jenny don't cry[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
I'll be home in the fall[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
So she held her head high and said nothing at all[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]

Then he got in a plane, Took it up in the air[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch]
It never came down[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
For all she knows it's stlil flying around up there[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Then Jenny went wrong[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
And the last that I heard[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
It's been seven years long since she uttered a word[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
Seven years gone since she uttered a word[/tab]

Now her father just sits all alone at the bar[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch]
He orders his drinks[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
And smokes cigarettes he knows he can't afford[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
He's got no regrets[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Says he's doing quite well[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
But every old man has a story to tell[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]

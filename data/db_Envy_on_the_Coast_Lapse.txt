     The road turned into a snake[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C#m9[/ch]
It looked in my veins and said[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Emaj7[/ch]
"It's in your blood"[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F#7sus4[/ch]
That's when I tried to run[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C#m9[/ch]
But it was way too dark[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]C#m7[/ch]

[tab]                             [ch]E[/ch]
Oh sweet chemical predicament[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]F#7sus4[/ch]                 [ch]C#m9[/ch]
Made sure that the needle was clean when I let myself fall asleep[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m7[/ch]
  And all I kept was a piece of your picture[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]F#11[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]
It slipped from my fingers when I slid into my dreams[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Eadd9[/ch]
It's not as deep as it seems[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C#m9[/ch]
And unfair as it may be[/tab]

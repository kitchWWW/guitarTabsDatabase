Tuning: Standard [EADGBe]

This is an awesome tune of Envy On The Coasts Second Album. Just to pre-warn you, 
some of these chords don't sound 100% perfect, but I think it's due to that bass 
notes making the chords sound weird. If you just play the chords they work fine :)

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]
I've been gettin' high, spending nights, with the television on in black and[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
white, in a room that's dressed in red..[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
Turning water into wine with a lady who must be made of porcelain and fire [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
and she breaths just like I do[/tab]

PRE-CHORUS:

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
She shivered like a good bride[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
should not swear just like July[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Lick the flesh from every bone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
'til we're satisfied.[/tab]

CHORUS:
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
You should have seen your eyes widen at the sight of my hands, Ripping apart those vows.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
Bucket of water for every match she struck for me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
But maybe, This is meant to be, Lady this is meant to be.[/tab]


[ch]Em[/ch], [ch]Am[/ch] x 2


VERSE 2: - SAME AS VERSE 1
Starin' in the mirror
without a stitch on, hands tied 'round
her hips and wondering who is
staring back at me?
So we drowned him in the pool, her in the ocean.
Bury the bodies in a park just down the street
and then crawled back in bed.

PRE-CHORUS: 
She don't shimmer like the others do
But she sweats like July.
Lick the flesh from every bone
'til we're satisfied, oh...

CHORUS:
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
You should have seen your eyes widen at the sight of my hands, Ripping apart those vows.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
Bucket of water for every match she struck for me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
But maybe, This is meant to be, Lady this is meant to be.[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I've been gettin' high...[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
And she breaths just like I do... [/tab]



Simple as that... :)

[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
My father takes us driving down a Maryland county road[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
Till we stop off at a restaurant where the lemonade is cold[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
The waitress calls us sweetheart[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
She's never seen our faces[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
And I can't figure out how my father finds these places[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
And he knows how the Civil War went down[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
And railroads used to stop for small towns[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
And the stores closed when the highway passed them by[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
These towns sputtered but they did not die[/tab]

[ch]C[/ch]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
We sit there at the table[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
As he spins his tales[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And in the window as we're leaving[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
We see a sign for a town fair[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
There's a pie contest and horses[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
And quilts stitched by hand[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
We sit all day and listen to the bluegrass bands[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
The farms roll on forever[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And we find a roadside stand[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
The farmer's name is Jason[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And he once worked all this land[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
We buy backyard tomatoes and strawberry jam[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
And his blue eyes still sparkle when he shakes my small hand[/tab]

[ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] x2


[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Strangers wave from lawn chairs[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
As we wind our way back home[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Crickets keep time in their corn field[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
As we drive along[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
Till we cross the river over to my hometown street[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
We'll be back again when we cannot stand the heat[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
To fields where the Civil War went down[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
And railroads used to stop for small towns[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
And stores closed when the highway passed them by[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
Towns that sputtered but they did not die[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                    [ch]G[/ch]
When my father takes us driving down a Maryland County road[/tab]

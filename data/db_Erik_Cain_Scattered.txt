[tab][ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
I just can't sit here and take that[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bbmaj7[/ch]                  [ch]Fm7[/ch]

[Bridge]
(Slow rap)
[tab] [ch]C7[/ch]
Treat me like I'm unimportant[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bbmaj7[/ch]
Like I'm less - I know deserve more and[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
All the effort that I put in's[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F7[/ch]
More than what you give[/tab]

You only give a portion
[tab]   [ch]F7[/ch]
I really don't want us to force it[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C7[/ch]
Guess we gotta let it run it's course and[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I just hope you never forget[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F7[/ch]
That I put my everything towards this[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Gm7[/ch]
And you threw it all in my face[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C7[/ch]
Baby that's okay, I'mma make a way[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
You took all my time and you were M.I.A[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F7[/ch]
I might cry a little, trust me I'll be straight[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Bb7[/ch]
You may have not known it, but you sealed your fate[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I still think I need ya, it hurts when I can't see ya[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Dm7[/ch]
Love is not the only thing you gave away girl[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Dm7[/ch]
You took my heart you had to let it break[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]Gm7[/ch]           [ch]Bbmaj7[/ch]
That's why I'm scattered[/tab]

You got me going in circles[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F7[/ch]
My mind in a whirlpool[/tab]

Don't know why it hurts when you...[/tab]

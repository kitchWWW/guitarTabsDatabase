  But I was dying of thirst[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Gm[/ch]
  A bubble about to burst[/tab]

  Things could be worse[/tab]

  Love comes first
  Maybe I was cursed
  From the day of my birth
  Things could be worse

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Put a lot of doubt in my mind[/tab]
About the love I thought I had
Maybe I didn't know what love was
But it was time to find out what was not

Was it just pure coincidence
For a kid with a liquid habit?
My way of going out in a bang?
I just had to reach out and grab it

  Love comes first...

  Love comes first...

Who was I to hurt and destroy?
How could I ignore someone's heart?
Was I really that insecure
Or just evil, and ruthless from start?

I can never change what I've done
But never stop wondering how
A fugitive on the run
Maybe to hard, to see the truth now?

  Love comes first...     |

  Love comes first...     |

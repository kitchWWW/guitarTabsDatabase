If I could write you a song to make you fall in love[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb5[/ch]          [ch]D5[/ch]     [ch]G5[/ch]       [ch]Bb5[/ch]
I would already have you up under my arm[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Eb5[/ch]    [ch]D5[/ch]      [ch]G5[/ch]       [ch]Bb5[/ch]
I used up all my tricks, I hope that you like this[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Eb5[/ch]
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb5[/ch]       [ch]D5[/ch]         [ch]G5[/ch]           [ch]Bb5[/ch]
You got designer shades just to hide your face[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb5[/ch]             [ch]D5[/ch]           [ch]G5[/ch]           [ch]Bb5[/ch]
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb5[/ch]       [ch]D5[/ch]      [ch]G5[/ch]          [ch]Bb5[/ch]
And you never say hey, or remember my name[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb5[/ch]
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me[/tab]


[Verse 1]
[tab]             [ch]Eb5[/ch]
You got your high brow, shoes on your feet[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb5[/ch]           [ch]D5[/ch]          [ch]G5[/ch]      [ch]Bb5[/ch]
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb5[/ch]
But you don't know the way that you look[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Eb5[/ch]
When your steps make that much noise[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]Eb5[/ch]   [ch]D5[/ch]      [ch]G5[/ch]      [ch]Bb5[/ch]

[tab]         [ch]Eb5[/ch]             [ch]D5[/ch]      [ch]G5[/ch]      [ch]Bb5[/ch]
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Eb5[/ch]     [ch]D5[/ch]           [ch]G5[/ch]           [ch]Bb5[/ch]
Behind your make up nobody knows who you even are[/tab]
N.C.
Who do you think that you are

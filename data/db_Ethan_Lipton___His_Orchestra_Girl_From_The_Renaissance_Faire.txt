Artist: Ethan Lipton & His Orchestra
Song: Girl From The Renaissance Faire
Genre: 
Key: 


Alright, sports fans.
This version of the song just has 3 basic major chords.  In the actual song, from what I 
anyway, there's single notes being played, but this sounds better if you're playing alone.

I know that it matters.. but that mean doesn’t mean you should care[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]F[/ch]
I left my wife and only child for a girl at the Renaissance Faire[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
Her name was Rowena: she came from Camelot[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
She spoke with the darlingest English accent...[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
or at least that’s what I thought[/tab]

[tab]                           [ch]F[/ch]
Chorus: Her bosoms were heaving..[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]F[/ch]
her hair smelled like steak...[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]F[/ch]
she poured me beer from her lips and I drank and I drank[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
Well, I quit selling software; bought an RV[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Picked up some cashews for Rowena[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F[/ch]
I drove us from sea to shining sea[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
she did the Ren Faire in Phoenix[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
she did the Ren Faire in joliet[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]G[/ch]
she did the Ren Faire in Fredricksburg[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]
Fredricksburg isn’t over her yet[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
Chorus: Her bosoms were heaving..[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F[/ch]
her hair smelled like steak...[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]F[/ch]
she poured me beer from her lips and I drank and I drank[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
Some nights she got cranky[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F[/ch]
some nights she got mean[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
some nights she got busy behind the snow cone machine.[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]F[/ch]
But I always forgave her when she came home and cried.[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]F[/ch]
No, I never felt down on my luck when I woke up with Rowena by my side.[/tab]

[tab]                           [ch]F[/ch]
Chorus: Her bosoms were heaving..[/tab]

she poured me beer from her lips and I drank and I drank[/tab]

[tab]                     [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
one day she went jousting out in west Tennessee[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
she took a lance to the helmet shattered most of her teeth[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
she lost an eye in a bar fight lost her leg to gangrene[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]F[/ch]

[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]
“what are you crazy?” and she hopped out of bed[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]

[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]

[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
I would tell you I was following my heart[/tab]

Sorry have just had a re-look at this and wanted to start again!

I worked through this song with the help of Jonathan’s tab – so thank you for that one.
Try playing with Chorus and Delay on to try to get that chime like sound. This
arrangement is for one guitar – obviously the Eurogliders had 2 guitarists, a bass
player and a keyboard player so there was plenty going on which we have to try to get in
the arrangement
… that’s my excuse anyway!  The song is in D

Verse:  Please note that the first note that Grace Knight sings is an A. The Bass is
pumping out a G. So we play a G with an A as the top note (so the singer can hear it and
pick up the note to sing.  The chord is a G (add 9)- there are a couple of interesting
ways to do this chord – try this easy one first

e|5
B|3
G|0
D|0
A|0
E|X

G(add 9) D
Oooooh! Ooh I want to find a better place
G(add 9) D
Oooooh! Ooh I'm for a better place

(Play this little lick):Please note this is played later in the song an octave higher

Chorus:
D           G    D/F# Em                          D
Heaven, must be   there-ere. Well, it's just got to be there-ere.
             G                       Em
I've never - never seen Eden.        I don't wanna live in this place

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
I got the lead role to a part I never wanted[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
In a movie where the guy lets down the girl in the end[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]F#m[/ch]
I don't mean to spoil it but the story lines not all that important[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Well it would be if he had realized what he had when had it[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Em[/ch]                                     [ch]F#m[/ch]
And the writers don't seem fond of this guy 'cause every line was wrong or a lie[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
And the plot keeps on changing makes it hard to understand[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]F#m[/ch]
How a person, so underserving[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Finds a girl that believes in him at his lowest point[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]F#m[/ch]
For the long haul, frequent drunk calls[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]Bm[/ch]
Now he's trying to remember her voice[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
But three years later he plays it cool never mentions her name[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
 And she always wondered why he let her go[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
And three years later, he's wondering the same[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]                         [ch]Em[/ch]
They casted poorly not a fan of the new love interest[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
Seems to only bring him back and compare what he had[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]Em[/ch]
Reviews are mixed on this, there's plot holes that can't be dismissed[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F#m[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
An audience not fully convinced and everyone trying to understand[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]F#m[/ch]
How a person, so underserving[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Finds a girl that believes in him at his lowest point[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]F#m[/ch]
For the long haul, frequent drunk calls[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]Bm[/ch]

[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
But three years later he plays it cool never mentions her name[/tab]

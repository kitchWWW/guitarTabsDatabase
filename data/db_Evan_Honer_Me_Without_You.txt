[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                        [ch]G[/ch]
Your name still pops in my head three times a day now at least[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]D[/ch]
Well it's got me wondering, do you think of me?[/tab]
[tab]                                                [ch]G[/ch]
I never cleaned out my camera or threw away the notes[/tab]
[tab]                                              [ch]D[/ch]
"I'll get around to it", been saying that for weeks[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Well I thought a change of scenery would do me well[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
I thought if I eat healthier I'd like myself then maybe you would to[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
So I'll leave Arizona try to be someone I'm not[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
I'll cut out weed and soda but still something will be off[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
Just like me, without you[/tab]


[Interlude]
[ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                      [ch]G[/ch]
It seems you finally have peace and I still act like I do[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
I'm gettin' by and all but it's a mess[/tab]
[tab]                                                     [ch]G[/ch]
I won't ever be the same from you I remember all the nights and the better days[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
Forgot the rest[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Well I thought I'd fill my calendar and busy up my days[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Take up running so I'd have less time remembering your name[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Wish I could say I'm over you, but make it true[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
So I left Arizona just to be someone I'm not[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I cut out weed and soda but something still feels off[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Just like me, without you[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]Am[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] x3


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
 I run to prevent a fall[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
To escape the wounds[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
The unanswered calls[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
Just put it all to sleep[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
Lay it all to rest[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
 I need to rid the doubt[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
To believe again[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
To even breathe in the same way[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]
But someone needs to show me how[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
I always thought that I would know[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
That when things were broken,  it would show[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Somehow I thought I always knew[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
The difference between the lie and truth[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
I always thought I'd live a little longer[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
To have a chance to grow a little stronger[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]
But maybe I was wrong[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
I ran, but I did still fall[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
I can't prevent the wounds[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]Am[/ch]
I'm sore, and my suffering's greater[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
How I wish for sleep so that I could rest[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
And I run from the obvious[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
Been so devious 'cause I thought that I was free[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
Thought that I was free and[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Eb[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]Ab[/ch]
We are broken, and I'm left alone[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]Ab[/ch]
Then I was wrong[/tab]

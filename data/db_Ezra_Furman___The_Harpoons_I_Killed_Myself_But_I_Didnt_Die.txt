I killed myself but I didn't die
she crossed her heart and stuck a needle in her eye
she promised me she'll never leave me alone
she doesn't sleep she only calls me on the phone all night

Intro Riff (x1)

thats just the way, the way I always was
I go to therapy but I don't take the drugs
I try and really look my life in the face
I think I'm learning that there's no way to escape, oh no

Intro Riff (x1) 

and the worst part is that I didn't even really care
it's just to be or not to be and either way I'm only barely there

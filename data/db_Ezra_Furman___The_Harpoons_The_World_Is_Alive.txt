There is life on this planet[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]B7[/ch]
And I know because I've seen it[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]C/G[/ch]
It is waiting in the slimiest of Saturday nights[/tab]

There's a white haunted moon[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]B7[/ch]
Hanging over the lagoon[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]    
It was made for a moment just such as this[/tab]

There are plastic bags in suburban trees[/tab]
[tab][ch]C/G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Keep your eyes open all the time[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]C/G[/ch]
And I think you'll find there's no place to hide[/tab]

There are sailors on the ocean[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]B7[/ch]
Little kids with crazy notions[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
And their heads are gonna spin like a tornado[/tab]
[tab][ch]C/G[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch] 
There's a Bible by the TV[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]B7[/ch]
And the curtains blowing freely[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]        
In this hotel room make my heart do flips[/tab]

There's a glass of milk in an empty room[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Em[/ch]           
There's a song at the heart of it all[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]C/G[/ch]
And we all try hard just to write it down[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cm[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
But you can't write it down[/tab]

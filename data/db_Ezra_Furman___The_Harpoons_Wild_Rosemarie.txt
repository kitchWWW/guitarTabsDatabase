[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch] 
I thought about water, I thought about the rose late at night[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
I thought about drinking, I started to hope you were all right.[/tab]

[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
And I thought about calling, but I was afraid you'd be asleep.[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]
I thought about God as a shepard wandering the hells looking for lost sheep[/tab]


[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
And I thought about Wild Rosemarie; how that was who you used to be[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]
How the wilderness sprang up around us, this dry desert heat[/tab]

[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
And I thought about water[/tab]


[Intro x 2]


[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I thought about honey, how I used to call you by it's name[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
How you move so slow and sticky down my throat[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
And how dry I became[/tab]

[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
I thought about the highways, all tangeled up like a ball of snakes[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
and the poison backroads and what a long time it'd take[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
to find you Wild Rosemarie, all cracked up on I-93.[/tab]

[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]                                       [ch]F[/ch]
The choice was your own to strip flesh from the bone and become really free[/tab]

[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
And I thought about water, how it drowned us after all[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]                                     [ch]F[/ch]
How we used to thirst for it to burst forth from the sky and start to fall[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
And I just got scared that you were still out wandering tonight[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
So here's this letter I hope you made it back alright[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Love always[/tab]


[ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]F[/ch](repeat until end)

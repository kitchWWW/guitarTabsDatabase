[Intro]
N.C.
One
N.C.
Two


[Verse 1]
N.C.
Some days fly by
N.C.
I'm happiest when I don't even try
N.C.
Grateful for everything
N.C.
The good and the bad and the terrible
N.C.
Shaped me
N.C.
But I've never met anyone quite like you
N.C.
The only one
N.C.
I keep coming back to


[Chorus]
N.C.
Lights out
N.C.
You're all I think about
N.C.
By now
N.C.
I thought I'd be over it
N.C.
Daytime is never too deep
N.C.
It's only at night when I'm trying to sleep
N.C.
Lights out
N.C.
I can't forget it
N.C.
My tired mouth
N.C.
Is already over it
N.C.
Why now
N.C.
At lights out?


[Verse 2]
N.C.
You'd be so proud
N.C.
If you could
N.C.
Look at me now
N.C.
You'd say
N.C.
"My god, you've changed"
N.C.
I think I love you
N.C.
Why would I evеr do anything differently?
N.C.
You're thе one I keep coming back to


[Chorus]
N.C.
Lights out
N.C.
You're all I think about
N.C.
By now
N.C.
I thought I'd be over it
N.C.
Daytime is never too deep
N.C.
It's only at night when I'm trying to sleep
N.C.
Lights out
N.C.
I can't forget it
N.C.
My tired mouth
N.C.
Is already over it
N.C.
Why now

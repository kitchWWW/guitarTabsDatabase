[Verse 1]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
I know my mom, she'd make you your favorite dish, she'd be obsessed with you quick[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
Like on night one, she'd welcome you in our home[/tab]
[tab]                                                       [ch]F#m[/ch]
Like you were one of our own, give you that East Coast love[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]E[/ch]
That's why I keep her at a bird's-eye view[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
So she doesn't get attached to you[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
And I know my dad, he'd say he's tempted to grill you[/tab]
[tab]                                                  [ch]D[/ch]
If you hurt me, he'd kill you, but he's not like that[/tab]
[tab]                                                                                [ch]F#m[/ch]
You'd probably bond over Springsteen, and how much you both love me and vintage Cadillacs[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]E[/ch]
That's why I keep him at a bird's-eye view[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
So hе doesn't get attached to you[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
But comе to think of it[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F#m[/ch]
I think I saw the end[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
You didn't get a chance to choose[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch] [ch]F#m[/ch]
There I go again[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Makin' up a bad excuse[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch] [ch]F#m[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]
So I don't get attached to you, to you[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch] [ch]F#m[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]
Attached to you, to you[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
I know my friends, they'd talk conspiracy theories[/tab]
[tab]                                                      [ch]D[/ch]
You'd know more of them weirdly, you would pass their tests[/tab]
[tab]                                                                                  [ch]F#m[/ch]
They'd see how you keep me safe, and show up for me in ways that they could never imagine[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]E[/ch]
That's why I keep 'em at a bird's-eye view[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
So they don't get attached to you[/tab]

[Chorus]
N.C.
But come to think of it
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch] [ch]F#m[/ch]
I think I saw the end[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
You didn't get a chance to choose[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch] [ch]F#m[/ch]
There I go again[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Makin' up a bad excuse[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch] [ch]F#m[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]
So I don't get attached to you, to you[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch] [ch]F#m[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]
Attached to you, to you[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]F#m[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
I'd rather walk on glass than give someone the opportunity to hurt me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
I'd run like hell[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F#m[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
And sabotage a good thing 'cause I'm so fuckin' afraid it could be perfect[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F#m[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]

And sabotage a good thing 'cause I'm so fuckin' afraid it could be perfect[/tab]

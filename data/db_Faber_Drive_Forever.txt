[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
We were seventeen[/tab]

But everything
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Still seems so clear to me[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
Whispering, and watching falling stars[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
From my beat up car[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
(I was falling, falling, I was falling)[/tab]


[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
In the parking lot,[/tab]

Almost ten o' clock
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
We went for one last walk[/tab]

I couldn't stop,
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
Thinking if I should try,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
A kiss goodbye[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
(I was falling, falling, I was falling)[/tab]




[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
I'll wait forever[/tab]

It's better late than never
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
Can't forget her[/tab]

Like a movie in my mind keeps playing
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]
Over and over[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Wanna hold her again,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
I'll wait forever[/tab]



[tab] [ch]C[/ch]
Time goes by[/tab]

But still I find
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
I can't keep you off my mind[/tab]

A broken piece,
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]
Of me I left behind[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
When you were mine[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
(I was falling, falling, I was falling)[/tab]



[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Our last embrace[/tab]

Those perfect tears
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]
Fell down your perfect face[/tab]

Your lips said words
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]
That I just can't erase[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Was this a waste?[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]
(You were falling, falling, you were falling)[/tab]



[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
I'll wait forever[/tab]

It's better late than never
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
Can't forget her[/tab]

Like a movie in my mind keeps playing
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]
Over and over[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Wanna hold her again,[/tab]


[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Bb[/ch]
I kept her letter in my wallet,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
And her picture in my phone[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
She had our favourite song set as her ringtone[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Bb[/ch]
We had everything we wanted,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]
Until we let it slip away,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
But we both know some things will never change[/tab]



[tab] [ch]C[/ch]
Time goes by,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]
But still I find,[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch](ring)
I can't keep you off my mind[/tab]



[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
I'll wait forever[/tab]

It's better late than never
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
Can't forget her[/tab]

Like a movie in my mind keeps playing
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]
Over and over[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Wanna hold her again,[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]-[ch]C[/ch]-[ch]F[/ch]
I'll wait forever (Forever)[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Am[/ch]-[ch]C[/ch]-[ch]F[/ch]
It's better late than never[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]-[ch]C[/ch]-[ch]F[/ch]
I'll wait forever (Forever)[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]Am[/ch]-[ch]C[/ch]-[ch]F[/ch]
Like a movie in my mind keeps playing (Forever)[/tab]

(Forever) Over and over
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]-[ch]G[/ch]-[ch]F[/ch]
(I'll wait forever)[/tab]
                   
I'll wait forever (Forever).

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I found the phone [/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I must’ve missed your message [/tab]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
You got it wrong, It wasn’t what your friend said. [/tab]

Bridge ( try the chorus??) (i dont know what it is)

What you give is always what you get. 

There's so much I haven't given yet. (or theres so much i havent given you) 

it seems so different with(out) a second chance.

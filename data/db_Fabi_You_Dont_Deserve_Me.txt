[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]

[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
But now i know it was all because of you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
Yes it was a rough time but i thought we could combine,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
but you disnt want to fight for us two[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]Em[/ch]
Dont you think you're selfish, you thought your life is pointless,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
even though i gave my whole world to you[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]
But this time it wont kill me,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
cause youre the one who lost me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
and i wont chase after you, cause i am fine[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
And i'm winner of this game, before i lost you i was afraid[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
to be alone[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
But you showed me i can be,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]
a better person just for me,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
just for me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
without you i am feeling that free[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Can live my life and just be happy[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
but we have seen each other once or twice a week[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     
Why did you tell me that you're in love[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Even though you knew it wasnt enough[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]C/B[/ch]
To give me the love, the love i deserved[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]Em[/ch]                      
You said i did nothing wrong but you just have to move on [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                                           [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]C/B[/ch]
because you think there is someone better than me[/tab]

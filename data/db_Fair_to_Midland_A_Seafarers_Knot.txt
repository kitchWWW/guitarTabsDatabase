CAPO 1

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Lucky are the leaves of the clover,[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
She's diggin for chemistry with the butcher's tools,[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Shifty are the eyes of the gambler,[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
He's making his tricks -- and a job well done.[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
Through the motions waving wishes to your confidence and eloquence,[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]           
He's turning a-green from these envious glorious things,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
Applied ambitious faith that can keep us all safe,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]
Invoking a blue that's meant for us too, [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
What small amazing things we will turn to rain,[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Lucky is a deer in the headlights,[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
Those two are as thick as thieves - not a penny more,[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Shaky are the hands of the gun shy,[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
He'd rather give up the ghost than stick by,[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
Through the motions waving wishes to your confidence and eloquence,[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]           
He's turning a-green from these envious glorious things,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
Applied ambitious faith that can keep us all safe,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]
Invoking a blue that's meant for us too, [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
What small amazing things we will turn to rain,[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
Gather 'round, hold your glasses up high,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]
Drink to love while we wait for high tide,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Keep it short, keep it brief,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
You have my word,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Gather 'round while we wait for high tide,[/tab]

[Chorus 2]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]           
He's turning a-green from these envious glorious things,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
Applied ambitious faith that can keep us all safe,[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                                         [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
Response recedes like fur; we're all a mess as though we owe him a favor...[/tab]

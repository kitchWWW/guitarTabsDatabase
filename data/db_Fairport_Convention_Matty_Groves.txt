[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
A holiday, A holiday[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
And the first one of the year[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Lord Darnell's wife came into the church[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]     
The gospel for to hear[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And when the meeting it was done[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
She cast her eyes about[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
And there she saw little Matty Groves[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]     
Walking in the crowd[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
"Come home with me, little Matty Groves[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Come home with me tonight[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Come home with me, little Matty Groves[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
And sleep with me 'til light"[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
"Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
And sleep with you tonight[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]G[/ch]
By the rings on your fingers I can tell[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
You are Lord Darnell's wife"[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
"But if I am Lord Darnell's wife[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Lord Darnell's not at home[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
He is out in the far cornfields[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
Bringing the yearlings home"[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And a servant who was standing by[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
And hearing what was said[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
He swore Lord Darnell he would know[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
Before the sun would set[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And in his hurry to carry the news[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
He bent his breast and ran[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
And when he came to the broad mill stream[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
He took off his shoes and swam[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Little Matty Groves, he lay down[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And took a little sleep[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
When he awoke Lord Darnell[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
Was standing at his feet[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Saying "How do you like my feather bed[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
And how do you like my sheets[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
How do you like my lady[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
Who lies in your arms asleep?"[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
"Oh well, I like your feather bed[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And well, I like your sheets[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
But better I like your lady gay[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
Who lies in my arms asleep"[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
"Well, get up, get up", Lord Darnell cried[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
"Get up as quick as you can[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
It'll never be said in fair England[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
I slew a naked man"[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
"Oh I can't get up, I won't get up[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
I can't get up for my life[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
For you have two long beaten swords[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
And I not a pocket knife"[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
"Well it's true I have two beaten swords[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
They cost me deep in the purse[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
But you will have the better of them[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
And I will have the worse"[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
"And you will strike the very first blow[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
And strike it like a man[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I will strike the very next blow[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]
And I'll kill you if I can"[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
So Matty struck the very first blow[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
And he hurt Lord Darnell sore[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Lord Darnell struck the very next blow[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
And Matty struck no more[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And then Lord Darnell he took his wife[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
And he sat her on his knee[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Saying, "Who do like the best of us[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
Matty Groves or me?"[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And then up spoke his own dear wife[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Never heard to speak so free[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]G[/ch]
"I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
Than you and your finery"[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Lord Darnell he jumped up[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And loudly he did bawl[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
He stuck his wife right through the heart[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
And pinned her against the wall[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
"A grave, a grave", Lord Darnell cried[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
"To put these lovers in[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
But bury my lady at the top[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
For she was of noble kin"[/tab]

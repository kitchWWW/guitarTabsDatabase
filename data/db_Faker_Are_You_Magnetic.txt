[Verse 1]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
I'm on the phone I can't say anything, in case I say the wrong thing[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
And you smile like you like this but maybe it's not working[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
I'm a stone under a mountain and I wish that you'd stop thinking[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
And you lie under the mountain 'cause you know you can't do anything[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
And you check your phone 'cause you're looking for an escape[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Sometimes when we fall we just land in the right place[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
'Cause we're magnetic and we land in the right place[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Are you magnetic, do you land in the right place?[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
It tasted bad, I wore a mouth guard, the blood was overwhelming[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
Head over heel, a mild concussion, do you remember was I talking?[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
You've been had and in attack you said maybe we're exhausting[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
It's not real but in attack, I know just what you're saying[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
And you check your phone 'cause you're looking for an escape[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Sometimes when we fall we just land in the right place[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
'Cause we're magnetic and we land in the right place[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]

[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]

[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
In this verse I found a credit card with six hundred dollars on it[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
In the next I hired a car and drove away[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
If the world just tipped and spun around and flipped and flung us from it[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
I think we'd land in exactly the same way[/tab]

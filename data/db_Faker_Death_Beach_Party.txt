hey hey come on lets go i wanna see your soul
running through that door, ive got a seed to sow x2
hey come on lets go i wanna see your soul 
running through that are you running through that door?
 
oh the sand the sand the sand the sand scratches my face
while the tears tears tears they fall in my embrace
and the waves crach down where the rocks meet the sand
why do none of these fears come out on dry land 
just when im drowning i look like im drowning
 
hey, hey come on lets go i wanna see your soul
running through that door i got a seed to sow
hey come on lets go i wanna see your soul
 
and i howl howl howl as you roll down the stairs
yeah the light crashes in i dont blame you not being there
and the round round round you came right round my place
in the half light i cant see what i cant face
and you look like youre drowning i look like im drowning
 
oh the sand sand sand the sand scratches my hand
and ther tears tears tears keep falling where i stand
yeah the waves crash down where the rocks meet my face
why do none of these fears come out help find this place
just when im drowning you look like you're drowning hey come on lets go
 
in the cold light, it doesnt feel right
in the cold light, it doesnt feel right
you're the cruel cool cool cool light on my face x3
you're the cool cool cruel cool light on my face
 
yeah the sand sand sand the sand scratches my hand
and the tears tears tears they keep falling where i stand
while the waves crash down where the rocks meet my face
why do none of these fears come out come find this place
you look like you're drowning
i look like im drowning
you look like you're drowning 
i look like im drowning, hey come on lets go.

This is just a basic tab.

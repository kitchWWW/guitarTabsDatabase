[tab][ch]C[/ch]
It's four in the mornin' and once more the dawnin' [/tab]
[tab] [ch]G7[/ch]
Just woke up the wanting in me [/tab]
 
Wishing I'd never met her knowing if I forget her 
[tab] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G7[/ch]
How much better off she would be [/tab]
 
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]
The longer I hold on the longer this goes on [/tab]
[tab] [ch]C7[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
The harder that it's gonna be[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G7[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]
But it's four in the mornin' and once more the dawnin' [/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G7[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
Just woke up the wanting in me [/tab]
 
 
I never deserved her God knows when I hurt her 
[tab] [ch]G7[/ch]
That's the last thing that I want to do [/tab]
 
She tries but she can't tell how she feels 
[tab] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G7[/ch]
But I know too well what she's going through[/tab]
 
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]
If I love her so much I don't know why I can't do[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C7[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
The right thing and just let her be[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G7[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]
But it's four in the mornin' and once more the dawnin' [/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G7[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
Just woke up the wanting in me [/tab]
 
 
Last night I told her this time it's all over
[tab] [ch]G7[/ch]
Making ten times I've told her goodbye [/tab]
 
Last night we broke up this mornin' I woke up 
[tab] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G7[/ch]
And for the tenth time I'm changing my mind [/tab]

[tab] [ch]C[/ch]
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her [/tab]
[tab] [ch]C7[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
Than most foolish men will ever see[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G7[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]
And it's four in the mornin' and once more the dawnin' [/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G7[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
Just woke up the wanting in me[/tab]

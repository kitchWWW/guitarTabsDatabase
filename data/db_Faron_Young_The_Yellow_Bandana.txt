[Intro]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G7[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
This is the story of a Yellow Bandana[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]G7[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
A handsome young soldier and a girl named Roseanna[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]G7[/ch]
Away out west in the wilds of New Mexico[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
There lived a girl and a soldier who loved her so[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]G7[/ch]
And every night beneath the full crimson moon above[/tab]
[tab]                                              [ch]C[/ch]
This brave young soldier would pledge her his love[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]G7[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
And he gave Roseanna his Yellow Bandana[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Dm[/ch]             [ch]G7[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]G7[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
He gave Roseanna his Yellow Bandana[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]G7[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Mounted his pony and rode off to war[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab]                                        [ch]G7[/ch]
His orders came and he had to ride west again[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]C[/ch]
Seems that Apaches were causing unrest again[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]G7[/ch]
He kissed Roseanna goodbye as he rode away[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]C[/ch]
Promising this time he'd come back to stay[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]G7[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
And he gave Roseanna his Yellow Bandana[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Dm[/ch]             [ch]G7[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]G7[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]G7[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]                                           [ch]G7[/ch]
The war was over and he came back home and found[/tab]
[tab]                                              [ch]C[/ch]
That the Apaches had burned the whole village down[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]G7[/ch]
And beneath the tree where he last kissed Roseanna[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Draped on a cross was his Yellow Bandana[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]G7[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]

To wear in her hair till he's with her once more[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]G7[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
He gave Roseanna his Yellow Bandana[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]G7[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I told you if your lips stayed so cold to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                              [ch]C[/ch]
There'd come a time your arms would lose their hold on me[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I told you that a man must feel the flame of love[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Not just a careless kiss that makes a game of love[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]C7[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]Dm7[/ch]
If you don't feel that love I know where I must go[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
You'll drive me back into her arms again[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
You laughed the day you took me away from her[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
I know she cried but still I wouldn't stay with her[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]C7[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I let you take my heart oh but you can't break my heart[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
You'll drive me back into her arms again[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
  I let you take my heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
  But you can't break my heart[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
You'll drive me back into her arms again[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
You'll drive me back into her arms again[/tab]

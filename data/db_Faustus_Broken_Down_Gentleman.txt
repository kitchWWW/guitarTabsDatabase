[Verse 1]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
When I was young and in my prime[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Just twenty-four years old[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
I spent my time in vanity[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Along with the ladies bold[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Along with the ladies bold[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
With silver buckles all round my wrists[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
And a cane all in my hand[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
No gentleman could me surpass[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
No farmer in the land[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
No farmer in the land[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
I kept a pack of good hounds, me boys,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
And servants waiting on me,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
For I did intend my money to spend,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
And that you may plainly see[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And that you may plainly see[/tab]
 

[Verse 4]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
I kept a coach and six horses, boys[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
Their races for to see[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
‘Twas there I spent ten thousand pounds[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
And that was the ruin of me[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And that was the ruin of me[/tab]


[Verse 5]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
As I was turning home again[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
My purse it did run small[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
For I was a broken down gentleman[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
And that was the worst of it all[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And that was the worst of it all[/tab]

The landlord came all for his rent.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
And bailiffs he brought three,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
They took away all I had got[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
And swore that they’d have me.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
And swore that they’d have me.[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Then rogues and thieves around me came,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
From them I could not run.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
They took away my coach and six,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
And I was quite undone.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
And I was quite undone.[/tab]

My wife I’m told she does lament[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
My children round her cry[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
To think that I must lie in jail[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
Until the day I die[/tab]

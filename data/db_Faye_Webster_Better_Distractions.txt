[Intro]
[ch]C#maj7[/ch] [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C#maj7[/ch]
Sit around until I find something better to spend my time[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]
But nothing's appealin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#maj7[/ch]
Nothing really lasts that long for me to realize, I'm still alone[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]
And you're not with me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#maj7[/ch]
I wonder what's inside your mind, but you seem pretty occupied[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]
So I'll leave it alone[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C#maj7[/ch]
If only I could do the same, share your ways, and I'll change the name[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]
And make it my own[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C#maj7[/ch]
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]
Will you? Will you be with me?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#maj7[/ch]
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]
Will you? Will you be with me?[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]   [ch]C#maj7[/ch]
I tried to eat, I tried to sleep, but everything seems boring to me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]
I don't know what to do[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#maj7[/ch]
Got two friends that I could see, but they got two jobs and a baby[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]
I just wanna see you[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#maj7[/ch]
Dependin' on our time apart, thе better the distractions arе[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]
And there isn't a lot[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#maj7[/ch]
Only took a couple times without you here to realize[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]
But I figured it out[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C#maj7[/ch]
Will you? Will you?   Will you? Will you?[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]
Will you? Will you be with me?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#maj7[/ch]
Will you? Will you?   Will you? Will you?[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]
Will you? Will you be with me?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#maj7[/ch]
Will you? Will you?   Will you? Will you?[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]
Will you? Will you be with me?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#maj7[/ch]
Will you? Will you?   Will you? Will you?[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Bmaj7[/ch]
Will you? Will you be with me?[/tab]

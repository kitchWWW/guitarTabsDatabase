[Verse 1]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
I met a pretty girl the next town over[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
Running like a river, thin and long[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
Other than her dress, she looked mighty well depressed[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
So I asked this pretty lady what was wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch]
She said, "All my life I tried to be an outlaw[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]A[/ch]
I tried to spit and chew and steal and rob[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
But I ain't no good at thievin'[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
So I might as well be leavin'[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
I think I'm off to go and get a job."[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
I told that pretty girl, "Don't be so foolish[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
Don't be so quick to leave this life of crime[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Now see, I'll be quick to call it[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
You can practice on my wallet[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
And that way if you're caught, you won't do time."[/tab]

[Chorus 1]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
Yeah, just rob me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Just rob me[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]A[/ch]
A pretty face like yours don't come for free[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
If I could call you honey[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
Well, then you can take my money[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Oh darlin' keep my gun and just rob me[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
So I saw this girl again a few months later[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
To see her with my gun was a relief[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
I said, "Honey, you got attributes[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Like lace and lips and high-heeled boots[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
But dearie, you're just no good as a thief."[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]
She said, "Mister, how do you know that I'm failin'?[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
I might as well rob twenty banks today."[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
That's when I looked her in the eye[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
And I said "Dear, I'd be surprised[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
You're pointing that there gun the wrong way."[/tab]

[Chorus 2]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
Yeah, just rob me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Just rob me[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]A[/ch]
Oh, money never did grow up on trees[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, you're no good at crookin'[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
But you're mighty fine at lookin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Darlin', keep my gun and just rob me[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, maybe every woman is an outlaw[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
I'm pretty sure they're pretty thieves in black[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
They'll make you scream like smoke[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
And then they'll rob you broke[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
I suppose you don't mind being robbed like that[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
So my pretty thief and I started a family[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
My outlaw's been givin' me in-laws[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, she kept her thievin' art[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
And sure as rain she stole my heart[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
She tells me it's all for a worthy cause[/tab]

[Chorus 3]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
Yeah, just rob me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Just rob me[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]
Deep down my darlin' is a thief[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, she may do the dishes[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
But I pay her for my kisses[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I know it's not malicious[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
She's just in the thievin' business[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
She calls herself my missus[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
But she's got me by the britches[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I say honey, keep my gun and just rob me[/tab]

----------------------
Notes:
-The Bbm#5 might seem odd but it's just moving 3 notes from the Bm down a semitone.
-The Gsus2 is just a D5 with G in the bass. But it's also the tonic so I labelled it as a G chord.
-Especially in the intro and outro, play the bass note only occasionally, this is what adds the tension 
as we're not sure whether to be at home (1 chord, D) 
or far from it (4 chord, G) - much like the protagonist of the song :) 
This is what adds the tension.
-G5maj7 and G5maj6 chords are more often called Gmaj7(no3) and G6(no3). 
But I prefer the power chord notation as it's easier to read.

[Verse]
[tab][ch]Gsus2[/ch]
We go out and drink all night[/tab]
You shuffle in close and it feels so nice
[tab][ch]D5[/ch]
When it's time to call it quits[/tab]
[tab][ch]D5[/ch]                            [ch]Dsus[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
They bring one bill and we ask to get it split[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gsus2[/ch]
And we'll leave here in separate cars[/tab]
You'll go to him and I'll go to another bar
[tab][ch]D5[/ch]
And meet up with a real close friend[/tab]
Probably be told that this should end

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E7/B[/ch]                   [ch]A/C#[/ch]     [ch]G5maj7[/ch]  [ch]G5maj6[/ch]
You've already got somebody to go back to[/tab]
[tab][ch]E7/B[/ch]                   [ch]A/C#[/ch]  [ch]Gsus2[/ch]
But I find myself wanting to tell you, you don't have to, go back to[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Gsus2[/ch]
So I try seeing other people[/tab]
And let you know just how it goes
[tab][ch]D5[/ch]
Cause you and I are always candid[/tab]
[tab][ch]D5/C#[/ch]
Very few things you don't know[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gsus2[/ch]
But I got something to tell you[/tab]
I just haven't had a chance to yet
[tab][ch]D5[/ch]
That I'm falling in love with you I'be been,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dsus[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Dsus[/ch]
Fall for you since we met[/tab]

[Chorus]
E7/B                   A/C#     G5maj7  G5maj6
You've already got somebody to go back to
[tab][ch]E7/B[/ch]                   [ch]A/C#[/ch]  [ch]Gsus2[/ch]
But I find myself wanting to tell you, you don't have to, go back to[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]             [ch]A/C#[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
But then the stark realization[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bbm#5[/ch]       [ch]Gsus2[/ch]
That I may never have you or hold you or get you alone for the night[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gsus2[/ch]
But I knew all of that when I let myself fall for someone who's loved somebody else[/tab]

And has for some time

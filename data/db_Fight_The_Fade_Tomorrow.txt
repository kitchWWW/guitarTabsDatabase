[Verse 1]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]F#m[/ch]
I keep going back, to the day we said "Goodbye"[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
The day we couldn't believe our eyes, and all they could do is cry[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F#m[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]     
I wasn't ready to say goodbye, I should've answered your call that night[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]F#m[/ch]
If I would've known, we wouldn't have tomorrow[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
If I would've known, I'd be here today[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]F#m[/ch]
There are so many things, I'd go back and change[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
If I would've known, I'd be here today[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
Still it's hard for me, to look at a picture of you[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]                                
Knowing that I missed that chance, to tell you "I love you," again[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F#m[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
This life is so desolate without you here[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]F#m[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]
I would've thought by now, I'd run out of tears[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]F#m[/ch]

  Don't let the sun go down before, you say what's on your heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                [ch]F#m[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]

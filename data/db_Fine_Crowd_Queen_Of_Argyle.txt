Intro; [[ch]Dm[/ch]] [[ch]C[/ch]] [[ch]Dm[/ch]] [[ch]Am[/ch]] [[ch]C[/ch]] [[ch]Dm[/ch]]

[tab][[ch]Dm[/ch]] Gentlemen, it is my duty
to inform you of one beauty,[/tab]
Though I'll [[ch]C[/ch]] ask of you a favor
no' to [[ch]Am[/ch]] seek her for a while;
[tab]For though I [[ch]Dm[/ch]] know she is a creature
of character and feature,[/tab]
And no [[ch]C[/ch]] words can paint the [[ch]Am[/ch]] picture
of the Queen of [[ch]C[/ch]] old [[ch]Dm[/ch]] Argyle.

Chorus:
[tab]And if [[ch]Dm[/ch]] you could have seen her there,
boys, if you had just been there,[/tab]
The [[ch]C[/ch]] swan was in her movement,
and the [[ch]Am[/ch]] marvel in her smile;
[tab]All the [[ch]Dm[/ch]] roses in the garden,
they will bow and ask her pardon,[/tab]
For not [[ch]C[/ch]] one can match the [[ch]Am[/ch]] beauty
of the Queen of [[ch]C[/ch]] old [[ch]Dm[/ch]] Argyle.

[tab]On that [[ch]Dm[/ch]] evening that I mentioned,
I passed with light intention,[/tab]
Through a [[ch]C[/ch]] part of our dear country
known for [[ch]Am[/ch]] beauty and for style,
[tab]In a place of [[ch]Dm[/ch]] noble thinkers,
of scholars and great drinkers,[/tab]
But [[ch]C[/ch]] none could match the [[ch]Am[/ch]] splendor
of the Queen of [[ch]C[/ch]] all [[ch]Dm[/ch]] Argyle.

Chorus:
[tab]And if [[ch]Dm[/ch]] you could have seen her there,
boys, if you had just been there,[/tab]
The [[ch]C[/ch]] swan was in her movement,
and the [[ch]Am[/ch]] marvel in her smile;
[tab]All the [[ch]Dm[/ch]] roses in the garden,
they will bow and ask her pardon,[/tab]
For not [[ch]C[/ch]] one can match the [[ch]Am[/ch]] beauty
of the Queen of [[ch]C[/ch]] old [[ch]Dm[/ch]] Argyle.

[tab]Now lads, [[ch]Dm[/ch]] well I must leave you,
my intention's not to grieve you,[/tab]
Nor [[ch]C[/ch]] for need would I deceive you oh,
for I'll [[ch]Am[/ch]] see you in a while;
[tab]Well I must [[ch]Dm[/ch]] find some way to gain heart,
to court her and to tame her,[/tab]
For [[ch]C[/ch]] I fear my heart's in [[ch]Am[/ch]] danger
from the Queen of [[ch]C[/ch]] all [[ch]Dm[/ch]] Argyle.

Chorus:
[tab]And if [[ch]Dm[/ch]] you could have seen her there,
boys, if you had just been there,[/tab]
The [[ch]C[/ch]] swan was in her movement,
and the [[ch]Am[/ch]] marvel in her smile;
[tab]All the [[ch]Dm[/ch]] roses in the garden,
they will bow and ask her pardon,[/tab]
For not [[ch]C[/ch]] one can match the [[ch]Am[/ch]] beauty
of the Queen of [[ch]C[/ch]] old [[ch]Dm[/ch]] Argyle.

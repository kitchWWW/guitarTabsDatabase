 Fink - This is the Thing

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
I don't know if you notice anything different.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                               [ch]G[/ch]
It's getting dark and it's getting cold and the nights are getting long.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
And I don't know if you even notice at all,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
That I'm long gone.[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
And the things that keep us apart,[/tab]

Keep me alive.
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
And the things that keep me alive,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Keep me alone.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
This is the thing.[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
I don't know if you notice anything missing,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                       [ch]G[/ch]
Like the leaves on the trees or my clothes all over the floor.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
And I don't know if you even notice at all,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause I was real quiet when I closed the door.[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
And the things that keep us apart,[/tab]

Keep me alive.
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
And the things that keep me alive,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Keep me alone.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
This is the thing.[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch]
And I don't know if you notice anything different.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
I don't know if you even notice at all.[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
This is the thing.[/tab]

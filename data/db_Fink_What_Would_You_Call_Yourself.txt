[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]C#m[/ch]         [ch]B[/ch]

   Under the soft gaze of the moon[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                [ch]C#m[/ch]        [ch]B[/ch]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]             [ch]C#m[/ch]         [ch]B[/ch]
   When I was eight, I created a world[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
   Where I was the first version of man in the eyes of God[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                [ch]C#m[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]
   Soon I had an army under my bed then under the house[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
   And I needed a title for my subjects to whisper in fear[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]C#m[/ch]   [ch]B[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
   What would you call yourself?[/tab]

Play Verse 2 Chords
They say that country music sold it's soul to make a dime
They say that Hank would disapprove if he was still alive
If he's rolling over in his grave, it's only cause he's seen
Everybody chasing the americana dream

They sing about the devil, they sing about The Lord
They sing about the road but they've never been on tour
Living in a fantasy they've made themselves believe
Everybody's chasing the americana dream

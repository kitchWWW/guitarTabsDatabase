[Intro]
[ch]C#m[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]

[tab]           [ch]C#m[/ch]
Forgive me now[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
For I have sold my soul for gold[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C#m[/ch]
Washed up on shore[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
A thousand miles away from home[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#m[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Just as I begin to settle into these skin and bones, alone[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
I find the answers to questions I have never known[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]C#m[/ch]
Is there life beyond the grave?[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]C#m[/ch]
And will I make the same mistakes, day after day?[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
There must be a better way[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab]             [ch]C#m[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
Running from time to try and keep myself alive[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C#m[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
Release my pride to keep from pushing the light aside[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]
Now as I begin to let this in[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
I must keep the best in mind[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#m[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
And remove myself from the things that are wasting my time[/tab]


[Chorus 2]
[tab]            [ch]C#m[/ch]
I know that one of these days[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]C#m[/ch]
I'll finally see you face to face at the golden gates[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]C#m[/ch]
Will you take me or will I fade into the grave?[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
I know these words won't hold any weight[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C#m[/ch]
But please don't turn away[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
Don't turn away from me[/tab]

Artist: Flatland Cavalry
Song: Coyote
Genre: 
Key: 


Capo 2
Asus2: 002200 Dsus2: 000230 Em: 022000 Esus:022200
Played with eighth notes, emphasize the downstroke on the quarters. I use a little palm mute through the whole
song. Hammer off with middle finger to step down when changing chords from Asus to Dsus.
Listen to the intro for the Asus2 hammer-ons with pinky and pointer finger on the A string.

Well, I spend all day sittin' in the shade waitin' in my pickup truck[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Asus2[/ch]
In not too long, a law man drives by, he stops to see what's up[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dsus2[/ch]
I had to pull on over and give my eyes a break[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Asus2[/ch]
You're a busy man, nothin' to see here so we send him on his way[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]
I see his taillights fadin' and I grab my glass of tea[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dsus2[/ch]                                           [ch]Asus2[/ch]
Truth is, my name's Roy Johnson, coyote is my trade[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Asus2[/ch]
Not five minutes later, a mesquite bush starts shakin' like it was afraid[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dsus2[/ch]                                                         [ch]Asus2[/ch]
Fifteen men, women, and children jumped in the back of my Chevrolet[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
Saw them tremblin' in my rearview mirror through my aviator shades[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dsus2[/ch] (ring)                                   [ch]Asus2[/ch]
Said, "me, I'm old Roy Johnson and coyote is my trade."[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]Dsus2[/ch]
'Cause you won't hear me comin' and you won't see my face[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I cut that trail a thousand times all without a trace[/tab]
[tab][ch]Esus[/ch]
It's my line of business, no, it ain't a pretty thing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dsus2[/ch]                                 [ch]Asus2[/ch]
My name is Roy Johnson, coyote is my trade[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I did what my mama told me, I got my four year degree[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Asus2[/ch]
Now I'm an expert in logistics, I get product from A to B[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dsus2[/ch]
No, I don't cut no corners, I've always got a plan[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Asus2[/ch]
If you're lookin' for my services, amigo, I'm your man[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
I'll get you across that Rio, welcome to the USA[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Dsus2[/ch] (ring)                                    [ch]Asus2[/ch]
Tip the hat, say the names Roy Johnson, coyote is my trade[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]Dsus2[/ch]
'Cause you won't hear me comin' and you won't see my face[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I cut that trail a thousand times all without a trace[/tab]
[tab][ch]Esus[/ch]
It's my line of business, no, it ain't a pretty thing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dsus2[/ch]                                 [ch]Asus2[/ch]

[tab]        [ch]Asus2[/ch]
Well, I clearly remember like it was yesterday[/tab]
I had that Chevy parked right under my usual spot o' shade
[tab]    [ch]Dsus2[/ch]                                                     [ch]Asus2[/ch]
Not five minutes, a mesquite bush started shakin' like it was afraid[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dsus2[/ch]                                    [ch]Asus2[/ch]
Fifteen Federales jumped out, they all knew my name[/tab]

[Chorus 2]
[tab][ch]Dsus2[/ch]
I guess they saw me comin', they saw my face[/tab]
[tab][ch]Asus2[/ch]
And I cut that trail a thousand times, guess I left a trace[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dsus2[/ch]
It's my line of business and I ain't ashamed to say[/tab]
[tab][ch]Asus2[/ch]
"My name is Roy Johnson, coyote is my trade"[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]       [ch]Asus2[/ch]
Now I spend all day sittin' in the shade[/tab]
Waitin' in my pickup truck

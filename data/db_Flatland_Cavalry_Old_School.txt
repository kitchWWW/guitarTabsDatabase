[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Hand me down Ostrich boots, dark wash Levi's, RayBan wayfarers on bloodshot eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
I dress like my daddy did, circa 1982[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
I make old school look brand new[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Raised on George Strait, Alan Jackson, and Pat Green.  I learned how to pick from a VHS[/tab]

Mama taught me how to sing
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
I sit out on the front porch[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
The crickets and coyotes sang harmony[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
We make old school sound brand new[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]                                        [ch]C[/ch]
It's tried and true, it ain't leaving soon or going out of style[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
So march around in your cowboy boots, swagger and a smile[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
Some call it classic, even old-fashioned[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
And others call it cool[/tab]

I call it old school
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
Well, how 'bout you?[/tab]

How 'bout you?

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Mama and Pop's love's still running like their '82 Chevrolet[/tab]

The same one that they brought brand new on their wedding day
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
They still drive 'round town with the windows down[/tab]
[tab]                                                      [ch]C[/ch]
'Cause they're more in love than the day they said "I do"[/tab]

It's true
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
'Cause they make old school feel brand new[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                             [ch]C[/ch]
It's tried and true, it ain't leaving soon or going out of style[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
So dance around in your old pearl snaps, swagger, and a smile[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Some call it classic, even old-fashioned[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
And others call it cool[/tab]

I call it old school
[tab][ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
Well, how 'bout you?[/tab]

I call it old school
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Well, how 'bout you?[/tab]

Woo-ooo

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Ab[/ch]
How far out have I got to move? Oh, I've got to get next to you[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Cm[/ch]
But you're so far away, Searching for a heart another world away[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Ab[/ch]
You're all I need now, if you knew. I can't operate with out you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cm[/ch]
No I could never live another day, Falling to the floor, You're my heart attack, Heart attack[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
   Heart attack, Heart attack, Baby, you're my heart attack[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
   Heart attack, Heart attack, Baby, you're my heart attack[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
Lines on your face[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Cm[/ch]
Tell the stories of the burdens you bare[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Fmaj[/ch]
Could you go there again?[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Ab[/ch]
And though I'm longing for your embrace[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]Cm[/ch]
It's still a feeling that I wish I could end[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Fmaj[/ch]
Now I feel like I'm crazy[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Ab[/ch]
How far out have I got to move? Oh, I've got to get next to you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cm[/ch]
But you're so far away, Searching for a heart another world away[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Ab[/ch]
You're all I need now, if you knew, I can't operate with out you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cm[/ch]
No I could never live another day, Falling to the floor, You're my heart attack[/tab]

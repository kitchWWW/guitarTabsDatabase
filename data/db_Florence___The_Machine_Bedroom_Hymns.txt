Artist: Florence + The Machine
Song: Bedroom Hymns
Genre: 
Key: 


Ok, so this is my second tab of a song by Queen Flo (+ the whole band). The one I found on UG didn't
sound right to me, so I watched a few live performances and I have found the right chord progression...
I hope.
I absolutely adore this song and I think it's a real pity it didn't make it to the album, though they
luckily decided to include it in the Deluxe Edition. It's supremely blasphemous and it really deserves
much more recognition than it actually gets.

Little tip: keeping the same chord for the whole verse may get boring, so I suggest you to play an Em/B
in the last 1/4 of each bar. The chorus and the bridge instead sound fine as they are, I believe.

Hope you enjoy this as much as I do... Please rate and comment!

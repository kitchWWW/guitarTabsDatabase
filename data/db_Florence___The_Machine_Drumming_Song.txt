// So that's how I play it and how, in my opinion, Rob plays it - he
// sometimes adds some minor things and stuff though, but you'll get the

// strumming, etc.

(Florence usually starts the song and Rob joins after the first verse)

#No guitar
There's a drumming noise inside my head
That starts when you're around
I swear that you could hear it
It makes such an all mighty sound
#No guitar
There's a drumming noise inside my head
That throws me to the ground
I swear that you should hear it
It makes such an all mighty sound

#Rob joins now, playing only the upper strings constantly

C
Louder than sirens
Am
Louder than bells
C
Sweeter than heaven
Am
And hotter than hell

# he kinda adds some little and easy "run" on the low e string here to       # change to 
the next chord (Em)

Em (played just like C & Am )
I ran to a tower where the church bells chime

I hoped that they would clear my mind

Em
They left a ringing in my ear

But that drum's still beating loud and clear

#note: during the following part Rob slowly starts to play all strings

Louder than sirens, louder than bells

Chorus

Em                 C
As I move my feet towards your body
    Am            C
I can hear this beat it fills my head up
Em                   C
And gets louder and louder
     Am                  C
It fills my head up and gets louder and louder

(watch the video again to figure out when he exactly changes the chords because I just 
can't be bothered now )



# please watch the video, because it's really hard to write this particular # part down. 
It's pretty similar to the
# one above. He first plays it alone one time (sometimes even twice). When  # Florence 
joins, it matches to the lyrics

beneath)

I run to the river and dive straight in


I pray that the water will drown out the din




C
But as the water fills my mouth
Am
It couldn't wash the echoes out
C
But as the water fills my mouth
Am
It couldn't wash the echoes out


C
I swallow the sound and it swallows me whole
Am
Till there's nothing left inside my soul
C
As empty as that beating drum
Am
But the sound has just begun

Em                 C
As I move my feet towards your body

I can hear this beat it fills my head up
Em                   C

It fills my head up and gets louder and louder



- sudden break -



# Throughout the next part Rob plays the same chord progression over and over again, 
adding some minor variations.
# The chords he plays at the beginning are
#
# C D Em Bm
#
# later on, he starts to add variations, playing Em* instead of Em and Bm*  # instead of Bm.
# Another variation I like to play is : C D Em' Bm*
# So there a lot of ways to play it, please - once again - watch the video  # to figure 
out and be creative when playing.

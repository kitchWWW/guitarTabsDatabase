* For the A#, simply bar an E chord shape at the sixth fret

The song then just repeats these chords for a long time... the final breakdown part that begins around 4:36 is simply Em with a rhythm that you'll have to get be listening to it.  Just so you know, I'm not 100% about the lyrics.  They're from Japan, and the words are a bit hard to make out sometimes.
Amazing song.

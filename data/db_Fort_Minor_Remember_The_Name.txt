[Intro]
[ch]Cm[/ch]  [ch]Cm[/ch]  [ch]Ab[/ch]  [ch]Bb[/ch]
   
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]  [ch]Cm[/ch]  [ch]Ab[/ch]  [ch]Bb[/ch]
   you ready?  let's go[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]  [ch]Cm[/ch]  [ch]Ab[/ch]  [ch]Bb[/ch]
             yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                      [ch]Cm[/ch]                       [ch]Ab[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]
   for those of you that want to know what we're all about       it's like this y'all, c'mon[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Cm[/ch] 
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Ab[/ch]                       [ch]Bb[/ch]
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Cm[/ch]
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Ab[/ch]                          [ch]Bb[/ch]   
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name![/tab]

[Verse 1](Mike)
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
  He doesn't need his name up in lights[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Ab[/ch]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Cm[/ch]
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Ab[/ch]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cm[/ch]
But fuck em, he knows the code, It's not about the salary[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Ab[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]         
It's all about reality and making some noise[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cm[/ch]
Making the story - making sure his clique stays up[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Ab[/ch]                          [ch]Bb[/ch]
That means when he puts it down, Tak's picking it up! Let's go![/tab]

[Verse 2](Tak)
[tab]        [ch]Cm[/ch]
Who the hell is he anyway? He never really talks much[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]                                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
Never concerned with status but still leaving them star struck[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Ab[/ch]                                   [ch]Bb[/ch]
That many misjudge him because he makes a living from writing raps[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch] 
  Put it together himself, now the picture connects[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Ab[/ch]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]
Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Cm[/ch]
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Ab[/ch]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist[/tab]

[Verse 3](Ryu)
[tab]        [ch]Cm[/ch]
This is twenty percent skill, Eighty percent fear[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Ab[/ch]                           [ch]Bb[/ch]     
Be a hundred percent clear cause Ryu is ill[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Cm[/ch]
Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Ab[/ch]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
And I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method, "Name Of The Game"[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Cm[/ch]
Came back dropped Megadef, took em to church[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Ab[/ch]                          [ch]Bb[/ch]
I like bleach man, why you had the stupidest verse?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Cm[/ch]
This dude is the truth, now everybody's giving him guest spots[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Ab[/ch]                                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
His stock's through the roof I heard he  fuckin' with S. Dot![/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Cm[/ch] 
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Ab[/ch]                       [ch]Bb[/ch]
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Cm[/ch]
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Ab[/ch]                          [ch]Bb[/ch]   
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name![/tab]

[Verse 4](Ryu)
[tab]              [ch]Cm[/ch]
They call him Ryu, he's sick, and he's spitting fire and mike[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Ab[/ch]                                [ch]Bb[/ch]
got him out the dryer he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Cm[/ch]
What a fuckin' nihilist porcupine, He's a prick, he's a cock[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Ab[/ch]                            [ch]Bb[/ch]
The type woman want to be with, and rappers hope he get shot[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Cm[/ch]
Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Ab[/ch]                           [ch]Bb[/ch]
Now the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cm[/ch]   
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Ab[/ch]                                   [ch]Bb[/ch]
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat[/tab]

[Verse 5](Tak)
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
  He's not your everyday on the block [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Ab[/ch]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
He knows how to work with what he's got Making his way to the top[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cm[/ch]
He often gets a comment on his name [/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Ab[/ch]                          [ch]Bb[/ch]
People keep asking him was it  given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Cm[/ch]
No  he's living proof, got him rocking the booth[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Ab[/ch]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]
He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Ab[/ch]                               [ch]Bb[/ch]

[Verse 6](Mike)
[tab]       [ch]Cm[/ch]                                            [ch]Ab[/ch]
Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Bb[/ch]
It seems like he's never got time[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Cm[/ch]
Because he  writes every note and he writes every line[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Ab[/ch]                                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Cm[/ch]    
It's like a design is written in his head every time[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Ab[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Cm[/ch]
And those motherfuckers he runs with, yhe kids that he signed?[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Ab[/ch]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]
Ridiculous, without even trying, how did he do it?![/tab]

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill[/tab]

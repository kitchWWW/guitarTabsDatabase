[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
There once was a very very holy vicar who was walking along the street one day[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
When heard a little voice cry EXCUSE ME VICAR, OH HELP ME VICAR! the voice did say[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
So the vicar looked around but all he could see was a tiny little frog sitting on the ground[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Excuse me little froggy was it you who spoke, did you speak to me when I heard that sound?[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
OH YES! cried the froggy, PLEASE HELP ME VICAR! For I'm not really a frog you see[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
In truth I am a choir boy but a nasty fairy cast a spell on me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
And the only way I can be saved from this wicked spell the little froggy said[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
Is for someone to take me and put me in a place where a holy man has laid his head[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
So the vicar took him home and laid him on his pillow and there he stayed 'til the break of day[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
And the very next morning a blessed miricale, the spell was lifted I'm glad to say[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
For there lay a choirboy in bed with the vicar and I hope you think this all makes sense...[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
FOR THERE MY LORD AND MEMBERS OF THE JURY[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
RESTS THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE[/tab]

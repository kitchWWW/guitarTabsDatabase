[tab][ch]B[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch] 
In summerdays[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
When we were kids[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]/[ch]F[/ch]
We were safe[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch] 
Chasing pretty girls[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]B[/ch]/[ch]F[/ch]
Just to catch another kiss[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
The taste of her lips[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]/[ch]F[/ch]
Made you full of butterflies[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
And now we're still the same[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]/[ch]F[/ch]      
But the girls they have changed[/tab]



[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
They're gonna make you feel like you've never done a thing right[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
Drag you down and then pull you up in their sight[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
And when you think you're good they prove to you that you're not[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
And when you had enough they're gonna put the guilt on you[/tab]




[tab][ch]B[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
I've been looking for that something[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Turns out that there is nothing[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]F[/ch]
That makes me feel that way[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]B[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
I call you i recall you always[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
You're the only one that takes me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
Closer to the truth[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]B[/ch]
Closer to my youth[/tab]


[ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]/[ch]F[/ch]

[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
There were times when we were friends[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
When all was good[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]/[ch]F[/ch]
With everything[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
But the most part of our lives[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]B[/ch]/[ch]F[/ch]
They have turned to something bad[/tab]




[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
That's when you made me feel like I never did a thing right[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
Dragged me down and pulled me into your sight[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
And when I had enough you questioned all that i said[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
And my confusing mind would always fall for that[/tab]

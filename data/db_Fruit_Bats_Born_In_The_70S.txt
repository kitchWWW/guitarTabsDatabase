[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Bm[/ch]
Taking gulps of big blue sea[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Of Georgia peach and Texas tea[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
The sands of time stuck in your shoe[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
They make you cross, they make you blue[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
Whatever happened to you?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
You were born in the seventies[/tab]
[ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
You were born in the seventies[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
The ins and outs and colds and hots[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Lost in space and parking lots[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
4:44s and 5:55s[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
They get me off, they get me high[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
So whatever happened to me?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
I was born in the seventies[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
           And you were born[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
You were born in the seventies[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
            And we were born[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
We were born in the seventies[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
            And we were born[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
We were born in the seventies[/tab]

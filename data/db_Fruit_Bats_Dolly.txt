Same as before:

Dolly you'd better bail, 'cause he's never gonna figure
Never gonna see that you're wrong for him
Dolly you're such a mess he ain't never gonna leave ya
Better come with me love
I'm gonna fix you up

If not then perhaps we'll meet in a week or two
Maybe by then I'll be good enough for you
Dolly, Dolly oh babe good enough for you

[tab]  [ch]F#m[/ch]                                   [ch]Bm[/ch]
As I walk through the streets of my new city[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
my back feeling much better, I suppose[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#m[/ch]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
I've reclaimed the use of my imagination[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
for better or for worse, I've yet to know[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]                                [ch]Bm[/ch]
but I always knew you'd be the one to understand me,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
I guess that's why it took so long to get things right.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Suddenly I'm lost[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]
On my street, On my block[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]
Oh why, Oh why[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Oh why haven't you been there for me?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Can't you see, I'm losing my mind this time?[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
This time it's for real, I can see[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
All the trees are turning red[/tab]
The beggars near bodegas grin at me
I think they want something       E
I close my eyes, I tell myself to breathe

[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
And be calm. Be calm.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
I know you feel like you are breaking down.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#m[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Well I know that it gets so hard sometimes.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]
Be calm.[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]F#m[/ch]                              [ch]Bm[/ch]
I'm scared that everyone is out to get me.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
"These days before you speak to me you pause."[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F#m[/ch]                              [ch]Bm[/ch]
"I always see you looking out your window."[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                                      [ch]A[/ch]
"After all, you lost your band, you left your mom."[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
Now every single crack, every pain that I pass,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
says I should either leave or pick it up[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]
But with every single buck I've made[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]
I'm saddled with bad luck that came[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
the moment I was baptized[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]E[/ch]
or when I found out one day I'm gonna die[/tab]
if only I could find my people or my place in life
then when they come to 'carolin'
so loud, so bright, the theremin
will lead us to a chorus                     E
where we'll all rejoice and sing a song that goes:

[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
And be calm. Be calm.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
I know you feel like you are breaking down.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#m[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Well I know that it gets so hard sometimes.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]
Be calm.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]C#m[/ch]
Take it from me, I've been there a thousand times.[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F#m[/ch]
You hate your pulse because it thinks you're still alive[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F#m[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
and everything's wrong[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
It just gets so hard sometimes[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]
Be calm.[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]F#m[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]C#m[/ch]       [ch]Bm[/ch]
I don't remember much that night,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]
Just walking, thinking fondly of you[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F#m[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]C#m[/ch]       [ch]Bm[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
Thinking how the worst is yet to come[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
From that street corner came a song[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
And I can't remember the man,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
The panhandler or his melody.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]C#m[/ch]    [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]
The words exchanged had far exceeded any change I'd given thee. [/tab]

[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
And be calm. Be calm.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
I know you feel like you are breaking down.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#m[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Well I know that it gets so hard sometimes.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]
Be calm.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]C#m[/ch]
Take it from me, I've been there a thousand times.[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F#m[/ch]
You hate your pulse because it thinks you're still alive[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F#m[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
and everything's wrong[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
It just gets so hard sometimes[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]F#m[/ch]
Be calm.   Be calm.[/tab]

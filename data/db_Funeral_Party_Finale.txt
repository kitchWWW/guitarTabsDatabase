-no chord-
I always knew we would end up just like this

So pour me one last drink with a final kiss

Things always end up in a miss

I'd love to tell you oh lets reminisce

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
And all the words that we couldn't say[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
In the backyards where we used to stay[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
The parents are on the way home again[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] (2x)[end on [ch]E[/ch]]
So sorry that it had to end[/tab]

-no chord-
And now we're right back where we started from

We're never leavin no we just begun

Supplies are endless but we just have none

You sleep your whole life and you called it fun

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
So wake up kid realize your life[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
We're movin closer to your demise[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
The world its ours and it's gonna stay[/tab]

[ch]E[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]C[/ch], [ch]E[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And we're singin ohhh[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
while we lie[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
And now your hair is grey and your shoes are worn[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
And the books you've read with the pages torn[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
You found one person you never knew[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
It told you what to look forward to[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
And when you woke up in your sad demise[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
You're movin closer to the end of your life[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]
We're getting out of your way[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
We're movin out at the end of days[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
Cause we are the voices under the tracks[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]E[/ch]
Drawing you forward, pushing you back[4x][/tab]

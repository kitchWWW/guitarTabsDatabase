[Intro]
[ch]F#m7[/ch] [ch]Em7[/ch]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
My cave is small and cold and dark[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
To me it's an amusement park[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
The books, the records, and the dolls[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Completely cover all the walls[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I never said I wasn't crazy[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
I know I'm a loon[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
I'm crazy for you, darling[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
And that's sadder than the moon[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
If I had youth and beauty[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
Would you sing another tune?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You don't love me darling[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
And that's sadder than the moon[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
We've both got wounds that never heal[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
That we're alive now is surreal[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
I guess I saw your shattered heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
As one more puzzle, and I'm "smart"[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I never said I wasn't crazy[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
I know I'm a loon[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
I'm crazy for you, darling[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
And that's sadder than the moon[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
If I had youth and beauty[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
Would you sing another tune?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You don't love me darling[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
And that's sadder than the moon[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
I showed you fortune, fame, and fun[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Dark rooms I don't show anyone[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
But I've run out of cards to play[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
If I was sane I'd run away[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I never said I wasn't crazy[/tab]

I know I'm a loon[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
I'm crazy for you, darling[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
And that's sadder than the moon[/tab]

Would you sing another tune?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You don't love me darling[/tab]

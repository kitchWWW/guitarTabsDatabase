[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]F[/ch]
This chest is full of memories, of gold and silver tears.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch] 
I'll give you more to own than all of this.[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
And I'll give you more than years.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                            [ch]F[/ch]
For you were once a child of innocence and I see you just the same.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                                 [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Your burdens couldn't win or lose a thing. Oh, I'd tell you once again,[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
but you're always on the run.[/tab]

 Slow your breath down, just take it slow. Find your heart now, oh.[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
 You can trust in love again. Oh oh ohhh[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                         [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
 Slow your breath down, just take it slow. Find your smile now, oh.[/tab]

 You can trust in love again. Oh oh ohhh[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                            [ch]F[/ch]
If you leave I'll still be close to you when all your fears rain down.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                                  [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
I'll take you back a thousand times again. And I'll take you as my own.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                              [ch]F[/ch]
I would sing your songs of innocence. 'Til the light of morning comes.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                                [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
'Til the rays of gold and honey cover you. In the sweetness of the dawn,[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
But you're always on the run.[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                         [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
 Slow your breath down, just take it slow. Find your heart now, oh.[/tab]

You feel the cure. I'll feel the toil it brought you.[/tab]

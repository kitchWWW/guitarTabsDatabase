[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Wood floors in your Soho apartment[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Every morning always roll one and spark it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Credit cards left on your glass table[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
You been wildin' since I met you last April[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
A beautiful, outgoing, alcoholic, socialite[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Like the way I talk to you, I was so polite[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Always claimin' that you're not the type to notice hype[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
But that's the reason why we kicked it and you know it's right[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I was your Bob Dylan, you were my Edie Sedgwick[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
But where I used to see beauty, now I just see pathetic[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
It was fun while it lasted but you'll never get it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
You're living in your own world, where love is all synthetic[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Yeah, and now you walk around woefully[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
For a minute thought about forever like it's Jodeci[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
But now you're spiraling and falling over hopelessly[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And I just wonder if you notice me, yeah[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And you're just spending your allowance cash[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
On some shopping sprees, drinks, and a powder stash[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
But it drains like the sand in an hour glass[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And when it does is when I see you turnin' sour fast[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Free falling from the sky 'till the gravel caught us[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Spending cash, burning holes in her fragile pockets[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Doin' drugs on the surface of Apple products[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Started beautiful but look at where havoc brought us[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And it was fun but I could never be the one for you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
You're never happy, always looking 'round for something new[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
But it was unbelievable when I was fucking you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Thought that I was momentarily in love with you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Nah, see you're in love with material[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And even more in love with attention[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Walking through life so eager for affection[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And never really was a connection, nah[/tab]

[Pre-Verse]
So in love with the scene she was
4AM is when she leaves clubs
She's...

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
In love with fashion, still trying to be Audrey Hepburn[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Grabs the check, but she spends what she hasn't yet earned[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Life's a bitch, if you play with fire you get burned[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
The road to riches could throw you off at the next turn[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Yeah, poor little rich girl[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Cries her eyes out, it's all part of the show[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Fell in love with the fast life but started it slow[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Loves creative types, slept with every artist she know[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Comes from high society, but they frown on her actions[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Instagrams half naked, how she sounds in her captions[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Always snobby and conceited, she knows what the deal is[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Wants to party, thumbs through a rolodex full of dealers[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Yeah, cause she said the high was divine[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
The first time is what she kept on searching trying to find[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Scared to lose it all but everything was nothing inside[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Couldn't face the truth but everyone's got something to hide[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
It's ironic how conscious she is of how she appear[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Two hours getting dressed but still can't look herself in the mirror[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Making poor choices, even at her wealthiest year[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Was a fast lifestyle that no one helped her to steer, yeah[/tab]

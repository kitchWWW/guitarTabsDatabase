[Verse 1: G-Eazy &amp; (Halsey)]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
My ’65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
They don’t want to see us make it, they just want to divide[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Dm[/ch]
2017 Bonnie &amp; Clyde[/tab]
Wouldn’t see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off[/tab]
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (ha-ha-ha)[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Hit it, no rubber, never would let no one touch her[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Swear we drive each other, mad, she be so stubborn[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Intense, this shit, it gets dense[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
She knows when I’m out of it like she could just sense[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
If I had a million dollars, or was down to ten cents[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
She’d be down for whatever, never gotta convince, no[/tab]

[Chorus: Halsey &amp; (G-Eazy)]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]
Cross my heart, hope to die[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
To my lover, I’d never lie (I love you baby)[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Dm[/ch]
He said “be true,” I swear I’ll try[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]
In the end, it’s him and I[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
He’s out his head, I’m out my mind[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]

[Post-Chorus: Halsey]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
Him and I[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]

[Verse 2: G-Eazy &amp; (Halsey)]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
We turn up, mobbin’ 'til the end of time[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Only one who gets me, I’m a crazy fuckin’ Gemini[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Remember this for when I die[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie[/tab]
My funeral will be lit if I-
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Ever go down or get caught, if they identify[/tab]
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
She would never cheat, you’d never see her with a different guy[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Ever tell you different, then it’s a lie[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]
See, that’s my down bitch, see that’s my soldier[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
She keeps that thang-thang, if anyone goes there[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure[/tab]
And she gon’ ride for me until this thing over
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]
We do drugs together (together)[/tab]
Fuck up clubs together (together)
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
And we’d both go crazy (crazy)[/tab]
If we was to sever
You know?
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
We keep mobbin’, it’s just me and my bitch[/tab]
Fuck the world, we just gon’ keep getting rich
You know?

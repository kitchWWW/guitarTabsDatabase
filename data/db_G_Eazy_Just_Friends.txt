[Chorus: Phem]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
You could leave it all behind[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Sometimes being blind is fine[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
If all you want is nothing at all (I said it all)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
You could always try again[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
It hurts too much to know we've reached the end[/tab]
(Cause we'll never be just friends x2)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And when I look around I see you everywhere[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I punched a hole in my wall and I just left it there[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
To remind me of that time I really took it there[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And remind me not to start again cause nothing's there[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
Cause if I call you that'll probably lead to something[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Cause we'll probably meet to talk and then we'll probably end up fucking[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                       [ch]Em[/ch]
We'll probably end up fighting, it's gon' be a lot of cussing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And shit can get disgusting and we're right back here at square one[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]Em[/ch]
And we could try be homies, but that shit ain't gon' work[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Not trying to sell a dream to you, for what the fuck it's worth?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
I did a lot of shit, I'm dying with my dirt[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
But you still holding on, you still sleepin' in my shirt[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
Cause if we open back then someone will get hurt[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And shit could get dark[/tab]
You ain't Courtney I'm not Kurt
Look
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Em[/ch]
Life's a bitch and father time is undefeated[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Tryna' live, it's better off to leave it[/tab]
You know

[Chorus: Phem]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
You could leave it all behind[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Sometimes being blind is fine[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
If all you want is nothing at all (I said it all)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
You could always try again[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
It hurts too much to know we've reached the end[/tab]
(Cause we'll never be just friends x2)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
How you go from inseparable to not attached[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
From havin' fun to these days, you don't like to laugh[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Always wreck shit when you give me something I could crash[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Patrick Bateman American Psychopath[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
Murder you in cold blood shit is over with[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I lose myself in my work it's how I cope with it[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
I find solace in a mansion whipping foreigns[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I don't know what's on the other side the door if I don't open it[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Em[/ch]
But yesterday you crossed my mind, then it hit me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
You was down as fuck, did anything to benefit me[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]Em[/ch]
It's kinda fucked up, you never got to live it with me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I finally start soft and cross my mind with drinking whisky[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
Fucking alcohol, it's crazy we don't talk at all[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I keep thinking bout' reaching out to you to till I'm like knock it off[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
Cause when I put the business first I started poppin' off[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
But if I kept it then which way would I be better off?[/tab]

[Chorus: Phem]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
You could leave it all behind[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Sometimes being blind is fine[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
If all you want is nothing at all (I said it all)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
You could always try again[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
It hurts too much to know we've reached the end[/tab]
(Cause we'll never be just friends x2)

[Outro: G-Eazy]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
From top shaped to becoming tainted[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Sharing everything to strangers living unacquainted[/tab]
Yeah
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
You prolly should await it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Untill we find out where we wanna take it[/tab]
You know, Yea

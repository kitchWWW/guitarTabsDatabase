Dominique LeJeune:

E     G#m              E          G#m

I-i-i-i-i want to love you-u, But i its not right-igh-ight what can I do-o.


Gb  E                 B/F#                 Gb  E               B/F#

 Everything will be alrigh-ight       so baby get some sleep tonight.


*And for the rap part you play:

B/F#

Uh, I wish we could just pretend to be

Gb                   E
Like we always were before as happy as the Kennedy's

B/F#

No one told Jackie about Marilyn's tendencies

Gb                           E

Ignorance is bliss when you're married half a century

Life is too short, trying to hold it all together

 It's gone before you know it but tonight could last forever
I wrote it out on paper but forgot to mail the letter
And you could walk away but you won't find nothing better

for the rest play the part where the girl sings :)

Then I said some shit that upset her
Arguing in public, talking loud as Big sweater
She said, "You're always gone."
I said, "'The fuck do you expect from me?"
Then she look at me and she said to me

[Hook: Dominique LeJeune]
I, I , I , I , I want to love you
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything will be alright
So baby get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Uh, maybe in some other lifetime
Or somewhere down the road we might meet up at the right time
Girls come with the profession when you write rhymes
Caught me and she told me I'm a pig like I fight crime
Well, maybe G is just an asshole
Fuck around with bitches alphalpha, little rascal
I swear my intentions aren't as evil as you think
But temptation's always pushing people to the brink
Fuck, I always lose my judgement when I drink
My only wish is you would settle down and hear me out
I know I haven't been completely honest and devout
It's difficult for me, these girls try to seek me out
I try to talk it out but this is all she speak about

[Hook: Dominique LeJeune]
I, I , I , I , I want to love you
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything's gonna be alright
So baby get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Uh, so if tonight turns out to be
The last night before you peaced then walked out on me
Lets let it all hang out like a balcony
One last time, the best is what you about to see
So make it worth it tonight, only so you know I never hurt you in spite
Love me like you never will again, it's our last time
Tonight forget about the pastime
Everything gonna be alright
So baby get some sleep tonight


Thank you :)

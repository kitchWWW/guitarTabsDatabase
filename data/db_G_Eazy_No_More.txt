[Chorus 1]
[tab][ch]G6sus[/ch]
Sometimes I just can't take it no more[/tab]
A6sus9
Sometimes I just can't take it no more
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
Said all I can, can't say it no more[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]
I tried so hard, can't try no more[/tab]
[tab][ch]G6sus[/ch]
Sometimes I just can't take it no more[/tab]
A6sus9
Sometimes I just can't take it no more
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G6sus[/ch] 
I'm really 'bout to lose my mind, the shit I've had up to here[/tab]
A6sus9
All the stress you put me through, wish I made that disappear
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
Think it's time we set some boundaries, let's just establish this here[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]
We've been through it, it's a lot of shit that happened this year[/tab]
[tab][ch]G6sus[/ch]
Need someone to talk to like I wish Mac was still here[/tab]
A6sus9
No Louis, but I can tell that you got baggages clear
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
You moved out, but you still be gettin' packages here[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]
Used to save the limelights, you won't let that inner fear[/tab]
[tab][ch]G6sus[/ch]
But seems like you actin' different when some rappers is here[/tab]
A6sus9
Shakin' ass all in the club like how you dance in the mirror
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
You was listenin' to your girlfriends who you had in your ear[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]
And she know everything to ask her why her man isn't here, for real[/tab]

[Chorus 2]
[tab][ch]G6sus[/ch]
Sometimes I just can't take it no more[/tab]
A6sus9
Sometimes I just can't take it no more
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
Said all I can, can't say it no more[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]
I tried so hard, can't try no more[/tab]
[tab][ch]G6sus[/ch]
Sometimes I just can't take it no more[/tab]
A6sus9
Sometimes I just can't take it no more
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
Sometimes I just can't take it no more, yeah[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]G6sus[/ch]
I'm fed up (Oh, yeah)[/tab]
A6sus9
Fed up (Oh, yeah)
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
I'm fed up (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]
Fed up (Ooh, yeah)[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G6sus[/ch]
Yeah, uh, I reached my limit, you pushed me to the edge[/tab]
A6sus9
To the point where you send text and I leave you on read
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
Wait, you ain't catchin' what I said?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]
If you think that you went up on me, I'm twenty steps ahead[/tab]
[tab][ch]G6sus[/ch]
Don't ask me what's my move 'cause it's on, fuck you[/tab]
A6sus9
'Cause you play games and, just for that, girl, I can't trust you
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
I said it's just to make a point, yeah, my heart told me to make this joint[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]
We've been broken long before this breaking point, you know[/tab]

[Chorus 3]
[tab][ch]G6sus[/ch]
Sometimes I just can't take it no more[/tab]
A6sus9
Sometimes I just can't take it no more
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
Said all I can, can't say it no more[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]
I tried so hard, can't try no more[/tab]
[tab][ch]G6sus[/ch]
Sometimes I just can't take it no more[/tab]
A6sus9
Sometimes I just can't take it no more
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
Sometimes I just can't take it no more, yeah[/tab]

Key: Am


[Chorus: G-Eazy]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
If she want sniff, she just looking for a lift[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
And if we finish of a fifth, I don't see nothing wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
If I spend a few bands when I should have let it stack[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I can make that shit back so I see nothing wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
If I smoke a whole ounce and I ain't even leave the house[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I could look at my accounts, and I don't see nothing wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I'm unapologetic, you can tell by what I'm on[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
If you don't like me, fuck you, this is nothing but a song[/tab]

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
My momma said judge not, yet he be judged[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
We don't trip, the bullshit just get skip like a CD does[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
She light up more than GE does[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I'm in the party just appreciating the molly and my fiji buzz[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Why stress I'm too blessed to ever come down[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I might be the rarest cat that's ever been found[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
One off the medicine now, and it's a wednesday[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
I'll fuck something and wake up drunk the next day[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
They love to talk about it, people saying I'm reckless[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
The microscope I'm under, they just love to inspect us[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
But fuck 'em, make them eat their words for dinner and breakfast[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
That shit come back around, full circle though like a necklace[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Fuck outta here, I came for no bullshit in my agenda[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
If you're artificial Splenda, well then you are not a friend[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I never save, I'm spending cash for as long as I remember[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                      [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
So I went to spend a fortune on this Porsche and not a rental[/tab]

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
She acting shocked by it, guess we live a little different[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I never sell my soul, I stay green and gold[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Knew I'd be a legend back since I was 10 years old[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I knew I would be gold?, his story would be told[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Imma have to fuck Jessica soon before she gets too old (Alba)[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I'll snatch her from her husband, I told you I was [?][/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I'm going super saiyan, yes I'm entering that mode[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Like Goku, I'm old school, so anti-social[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
The money is all I say hello to[/tab]
Like God Damn this shit so soon

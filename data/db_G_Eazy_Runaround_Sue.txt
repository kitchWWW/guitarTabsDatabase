[tab][ch]D[/ch]
(Oooh) Here's my story it's sad but true[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
(Oooh) It's about a girl that I once knew[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
(Oooh) She took my love, then ran around[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]

Hey hey, woooh, [/tab]

She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                            [ch]A[/ch]
Sue's the prettiest girl in town, but she's venom to your veins[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Heartbreak hotel room, 505[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I was blinded by love, and the way she lied[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
Not me, no way, but that day she fooled me[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
When I caught Sue running around[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
She was running around, she was running around, she was running around[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
She was, she was running around[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Umm, so I said "peace," and I left it[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Can't get mad at me when your actions request it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Couldn't even tell me to my face, had to text it[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
You can pack your bags, follow signs to the exit[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Yes, move it along please, pronto[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Oh, and by the way, return your keys to the condo[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
If you played at the Apollo[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
You'd be the type of act that I would boo off stage while I throw you a tomato[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
A tough act to follow[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But you fooled me, bravo[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
Can't believe I fell for your bull, Chicago[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                          [ch]G[/ch]
Can't believe you asked me to stay, nah ho[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                                  [ch]A[/ch]
I'm out of here with rocket power, babe, Otto[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                              [ch]G[/ch]
She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                                 [ch]A[/ch]
Sue's the prettiest girl in town, but she's venom to your veins[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Heartbreak hotel room, 505[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I was blinded by love, and the way she lied[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                         [ch]A[/ch]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
When I caught Sue running around[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
She was running around, she was running around, she was running around[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
She was, she was running around[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]               
Well, I should've known she would run around[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Chill for a second, then peace when the Summer's down[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                                                           [ch]A[/ch]
Now how dumb I sound, ever since I fell for the apple of my eye?[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Cupid always keeps his gun around[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                            [ch]G[/ch]
When I smash, she was like a woman from the past[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
A Mary Tyler Moore with more ass[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Should've figured something when she let me score fast[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
But I was misguided thinking she had more class[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Nah, I couldn't be wronger[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]                        
Fuck it anyways, it was time to move onward[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
I'm tripping no longer[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
Put her on the streets like a banksy[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
Cause I was too swanky, and she was too skanky[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                            [ch]G[/ch]
She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                                   [ch]A[/ch]

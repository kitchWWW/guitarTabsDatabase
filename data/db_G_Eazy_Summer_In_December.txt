[Intro]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]
Uh, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
I just told myself, uh[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
Yeah, uh, yeah[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Welcome to LA[/tab]
The land of opportunity where everybody stay
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
The girls are pretty, the sun will shine 360 days[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]Dm[/ch]
But I don't always feel that way, today I need some gray[/tab]
Yeah, uh, please protect my soul before they weather it away
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
The land of opportunity where everybody stay[/tab]

[Verse 1]
Yeah
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
They move out to this town where dreams, ambitions, and get lost in the party[/tab]
Takes a toll on you, man, this shit will charge a large fee
[tab]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
Just don't forget who you are, G[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]Dm[/ch]
Staring at the man in the mirror, like I recognize him hardly[/tab]
Burn my sins away and twist some parsley
[tab]                                        [ch]G[/ch]
Stop and chill, these days I do it sparsely[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
In another universe I coulda' had a stroller and a car seat, word[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
They tell me things will happen how they supposed to[/tab]
But somehow it seems I hurt all the people I get close to
[tab]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
Experiencing breakdowns at 27 goes through[/tab]
[tab]                                                [ch]Dm[/ch]
'Cause you don't want to see heaven yet, where Janis Joplin knows you[/tab]
On phone calls with Mama like she tryin' to give me a earfull
[tab]                                        [ch]Am[/ch]
She said "This is the town that happens in so just be careful[/tab]
Been tryin' to keep your head straight
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]
And dead-off all that bullshit, that's just dead weight"[/tab]
Yeah

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Welcome to LA[/tab]
The land of opportunity where everybody stay
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                                        [ch]Am[/ch]
The girls are pretty, the sun will shine 360 days[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
But I don't always feel that way, today I need some gray[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Yeah, uh, please protect my soul before they weather it away[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]
The land of opportunity where everybody stay[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]                           [ch]F[/ch]
The whole world's outside knocking at my door like "Gerald, where the fuck that album at?"[/tab]
But I ain't home, I'm on the road, the stage is where they found me at
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
So my personal interest, take a backseat to the business[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
But I balance like a gymnast, like Simone in the Olympics[/tab]
So please pardon my tardiness, I'm tryin' to put my heart in this
[tab]                               [ch]Am[/ch]
Give this shit my everything, every time when I start with this[/tab]
Hungry for the world, thatâ€™s why I starve for this
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
Yeah, artists come and go these days it's easy, they're not hard to miss[/tab]
Here today, gone tomorrow, they fade into a dark abyss
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]Am[/ch]
Hollywood sold you a dream, like how the fuck you fall for this?[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
Have to know yourself or you just really gon' get lost in this, sauce[/tab]
I really paid the cost to be a boss
[tab]                                           [ch]Am[/ch]
I paid in cash and skipped the tax, ain't asked for no receipt[/tab]
When I get stressed I play the beat and split a Swisher Sweet
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Damn, yeah, uh[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Welcome to LA[/tab]
The land of opportunity where everybody stay
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                         [ch]Am[/ch]
The girls are pretty, the sun will shine 360 days[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]Dm[/ch]
But I don't always feel that way, today I need some gray[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Yeah, uh, please protect my soul before they weather it away[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]
The land of opportunity, yeah, uh[/tab]

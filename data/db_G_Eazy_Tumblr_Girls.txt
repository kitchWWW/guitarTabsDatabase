[Verse 1]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]Em[/ch]
'Cause I'm in love with these Tumblr girls, with skinny waists and drug habits[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Dm[/ch]
Pretty faces love status, she acts as if she's the baddest[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                           [ch]Em[/ch]
Man I swear she's just like tons of girls, she expects the free drinks[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
And I'm successful she thinks, always comes around when weed stinks[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
We fuck off and on, off and on, only ever really fuck off and on[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
Never see her these days cause I'm often gone[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]
When I'm home off tour never stop for long[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]
Back this week from across the pond[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                                          [ch]G[/ch]
Noticed I was close to the block she's on, elevator to the floor her loft is on[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]
Drinking whiskey, she likes vodka strong[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
But after we fuck it's over, walked out the door, that's closure[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Dm[/ch]                                        [ch]Am[/ch]
Know I can't stay here and hold her, tomorrow act like I don't know her[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Wouldn't ever be here sober, can't tell which one is colder[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Dm[/ch]                                   (N.C)
My clothing's on, we both did wrong, I gotta go that's what I told her[/tab]

(i do single down strums here.)
 
[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]Am[/ch]
She said she can't feel her face, right now I can't feel my heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]Em[/ch]
For your feelings there's no place, but she knew that from the start[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last[/tab]
(N.C)
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]
Meant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
She's fine as fuck and she knows it, sexy body she shows it[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Dm[/ch]
Loves the drama she chose it, she draws the line then she blows it[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
The most fun I suppose it, pops a bottle won't close it[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]Dm[/ch]
Fills a fifth then she throws it, she pops a bar now she's dozing[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
She's hot and cold, hot and cold, homie I don't know she's hot and cold[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]Dm[/ch]
Truly the bullshit has gotten old, superficial with a rotten soul[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Fucking off and on, always stop and go[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Probably got someone, choose not to know[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Head to her place then we lock the door[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Making bad calls when I'm off the blow[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]Em[/ch]
'Cause she's a bitch, I'm selfish, want every girl, can't help it[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
And it's tough for me to shelf it, it's you I see myself with[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
Right now I know you felt it, I touched her then she melted[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
We shouldn't chill but we do it still, gotta play the hand if you dealt it[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]Am[/ch]
She said she can't feel her face, right now I can't feel my heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]Em[/ch]
For your feelings there's no place, but she knew that from the start[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last[/tab]
(N.C)
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Meant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed[/tab]
(N.C)
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last

[Outro]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
Missing everything you say, it's not important what you stand for[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
You're asking will he be the one, I'll be gone before you're done tonight[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Waiting for another day, you're not getting what you paid for[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Trying to salvage what's undone and deny you got outrun tonight[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
Never knew her name, they're looking all the same to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
They only chase the fame, there's no one left to blame but me[/tab]

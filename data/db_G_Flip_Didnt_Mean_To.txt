[Verse 1]
N.C.
I fucked up everything, baby
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]Cm[/ch]
Why do I gotta be so reckless with my honesty?[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]
I'm all that you want, but not what you need[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]
I'm so deep in the water, making this harder[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]
We don't want to fight, but you're in the corner[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]Cm[/ch]
And now I'm a monster, at least though, I tried[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Eb[/ch]
But you know that I know it's too late to say that[/tab]

[Chorus]
N.C.
I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to fuck it up bad
N.C.
I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to make you so sad
N.C.
I didn't mean to ruin everything that we had
N.C.
Why'd I let you go? Why'd I let you go?
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                                            [ch]F[/ch]
I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to make you cry[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]Cm[/ch]
I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to say goodbye[/tab]
[tab]                                                 [ch]Eb[/ch]
I didn't mean to, you know that I was losing my mind[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]Bb[/ch]
Why'd I let you go? Why'd I let you go?[/tab]

[Verse 2]

What have we become, baby?
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
I thought that you were the one[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Cm[/ch]
And I'm not trying to be a lyin', cryin' piece of shit[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Eb[/ch]
I'm doing everything I can to find a little bit of hope in it[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]
I'm so deep in the water, making this harder[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]
We don't want to fight, but you're in the corner[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]Cm[/ch]
And now I'm a monster, at least though, I tried[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Eb[/ch]
But you know that I know it's too late to say that[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                                             [ch]F[/ch]
I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to fuck it up bad[/tab]
[tab]                                               [ch]Cm[/ch]
I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to make you so sad[/tab]
[tab]                                          [ch]Eb[/ch]

[tab]                                      [ch]Bb[/ch]

[tab]                                              [ch]F[/ch]

[tab]                                            [ch]Cm[/ch]

[tab]                                       [ch]Bb[/ch]

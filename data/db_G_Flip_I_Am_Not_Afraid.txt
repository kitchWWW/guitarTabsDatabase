[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]     [ch]Cm[/ch]           [ch]Ab[/ch]
 I am fine feeling lonely[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]        [ch]Cm[/ch]               [ch]Ab[/ch]
 I found comfort in what's here[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]                       [ch]Cm[/ch]
You know I don't mind that you're out the door[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Ab[/ch]
I've picked myself up off the fucking floor[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bb[/ch]               [ch]Cm[/ch]                     [ch]Ab[/ch]
Yeah, this here, baby, this here, babe, ain't love[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]Cm[/ch]
So take me as I am, watch me as I go[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Ab[/ch]
I've been sailing seas âfore you jumped afloat[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Cm[/ch]
And now you're standing on the sidewalk[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Ab[/ch]
Calling Georgia to come alive[/tab]

But she's been dead the whole time
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]Cm[/ch]  [ch]Ab[/ch]         [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]Cm[/ch]  [ch]Ab[/ch]
And I      tried, and I      cried[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Cm[/ch]
I am not afraid to do this alone[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Ab[/ch]
I know that it scares you but I am my own home[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Cm[/ch]
I am not afraid to do this alone[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Ab[/ch]
I know that it scares you but I am my own home[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch] [ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Ab[/ch]
And I've  cried[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Eb[/ch]                [ch]Cm[/ch]
I am not afraid to do this alone[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Ab[/ch]
I know that it scares you but I am my own home[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Don't care if you don't like me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
You know you're full of shit[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
I'm standing on two feet now[/tab]

It was hard to admit
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
You were part of my story[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
A world that we had built[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
But I have overcome it[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]Cm[/ch]
And acknowledge that you were not safe to love so[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Ab[/ch]
I'll run with the wind and I'll grow[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]Cm[/ch]
A set of wings and free fall[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Ab[/ch]
Into a world where I'll own all[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]Cm[/ch]
So take me as I am, watch me as I go[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Ab[/ch]
I've been sailing seas 'fore you jumped afloat[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Cm[/ch]
And now you're standing on the sidewalk[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Ab[/ch]
Calling Georgia to come alive[/tab]

(But she's been dead the whole time)


[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Cm[/ch]

And I've  cried[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Eb[/ch]                [ch]Cm[/ch]
I am not afraid to do this alone[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Ab[/ch]
I know that it scares you but I am my own home[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]              [ch]Cm[/ch]
Change in love, change in love[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
Changed me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]              [ch]Cm[/ch]
Change in love, change in love[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
Changed me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Eb[/ch]                  [ch]Cm[/ch]
And, I have lost all that I had found[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Ab[/ch]
Picked myself up off the fucking ground[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Cm[/ch]                     [ch]Ab[/ch]

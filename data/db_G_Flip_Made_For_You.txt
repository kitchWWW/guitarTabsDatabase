[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]Dm[/ch]
  He was ninety-one when he left this place[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]C[/ch]
The whole family flew in from out of state[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]G[/ch]
I didn't get to say goodbye because of  you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
  All of my friends, they're growing up[/tab]
[tab]                                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Some have got engaged, and some have got knocked up[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
I missed every celebration because of  you[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]
But you put me here on this throne[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
And I love you too goddamn much[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
So I play along[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
Done with all your bullshit[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Turns out you are too[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
We're so bad together[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
I think I was made for you[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
You done a lot of cruel things[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
I say, "Shame on you"[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
But I know I'm no better[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse 2]
[tab]                                            [ch]Dm[/ch]
Danced with the devil, I've seen the lowest lows[/tab]
[tab]                                              [ch]C[/ch]
But you've been by my side no matter where I go[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
I found myself because of  you[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
I was nine years old when you handed me life[/tab]
[tab]                                               [ch]C[/ch]
Then Jenny said, "Kid, things are gonna be alright"[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
I'm heading upstairs to get a better  view[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]

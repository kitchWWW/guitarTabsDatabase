Artist: G-Unit
Song: Wanna Get To Know You
Genre: 
Key: 


this is one of the few hip-hop songs that translate well onto an acoustic guitar. these
can be played many different ways (some omitting the 9th) but the ones below seem to
and sound great. the transition between the Ebmaj9 and the Fmaj9 is simple all you have 
do is slide your finger pattern up 2 frets. any percussive type of strumming pattern will
and when i play i'll throw in some riffs based in Eb major. g-g-g-g-g-g-G-UNIT!!

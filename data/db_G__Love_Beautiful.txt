Well you say I’m crazy cause I can’t make up my mind
But I wont let it faze me instead ill leave all these thoughts behind
Cause you say that you got some one who’s wasting your time
Well that’s alright cause I got someone who’s wasting mine
(Chorus)
It’s in the way you move
Baby what you’re doing to me
I can’t stand it I can’t hold back
Every time I see you get beautiful beautiful
It’s in the way you do
Baby what you’re doing to me
The way you shine, strum your cords, the way your mine
The way you sing your words

It aint my fault I’m falling
Cause you got what it takes
Earth quakes couldn’t shake us
Foundation that were building off of an awful long time I waited but I never lose faith
I need someone like you here I'm crazy Libra babe.
Always searching for balance sometimes I choose right or wrong you know its just a 
but Gemini if we try you and I we will find all the time we wasting just gave us time to find 
other

Peanut butter jelly, bread and butter
(Chorus)

Now
No you were never second best
Wouldn’t let you settle for less
Aw babe that’s for sure and here you come down with the confidence now
Cause you had me at first glance
Baby what you’re doing to me
Aw babe that’s for sure
And now you give me that feeling feeling feeling
Aw honey your dangerous
Baby what you’re doing to me
Aw babe that’s for sure
Well here you come knocking on my hotel door
And you bless me never stress me
Come caress me
Darling like the wind caress a tree
Tugging on my skirt taking off my shirt
Whatever you’re doing well it seems to work
Yea

Hold me down...
Baby what you’re doing to me
Hold me down...
Baby what you’re doing to me...
Feeling...
You know you give me that feeling feeling

Was listening to the album and picked up my guitar and figured a few songs off the
album. Love G.Love never had an account on here and don't see many tabbed songs so I 
made on
to share my tabs if ya guys know some bits and parts to a song email me and we can 
figure them out together and put a tab on here because G.Love is dope.

play e minor first then hammer on the open G to get an E chord and upstroke the open E 
and B
 then slide from the F note(1st fret) the g# note(4th fret) 2x to the f#note (2nd
fret)2x do some palm mute or something to make it sound cool

This is my first tab so please if it sucks keep in mind that is the best I could 
come up with...I recommend listening to the recording to get the rhythm right
there's a strumming pattern and muting of strings...fills? no clue 
whatsoever...this just to get you started...rest is up to you, hope you like it!

Lyrics

[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
You might be crazy[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
But then again, so am I[/tab]


[tab][ch]B7[/ch]
They ought to stick me in an institution[/tab]


[tab][ch]Ab7[/ch]
Just so I can be by your side[/tab]


[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]         [ch]B7[/ch]
Look at me, I'm still hanging around[/tab]


[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]           [ch]B7[/ch]         [ch]F#m[/ch]  
Still hangin around, oh baby I'm still around[/tab]


(Same as 1st verse)
You might break up
In a million pieces
Crying in the middle of the street
Blame it all on me
Look at me, still hanging around
Still hangin around, oh baby I'm still around


[tab][ch]B7[/ch]                                                   [ch]F#m[/ch]
People say you don't fall in and out of love all the time[/tab]


[tab][ch]B7[/ch]                      
People say that it don't come easy[/tab]

[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
But you sure came easy for me oh my[/tab]


(Same as 1st verse)
Now, I won't tell no one our business
About the night we met
But if you're lookin for trouble
Trouble is what you get
Look at me, still hanging around
Still hangin around, oh baby I'm still around

[tab][ch]B7[/ch]                                                        [ch]F#m[/ch]
Now there's a lot of things that I'd like to change 'bout myself[/tab]


[tab][ch]B7[/ch]
There ain't a thing I'd change about you baby[/tab]


Except maybe... well...

[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
Oh I'm just kidding can't you tell[/tab]
You're like water from the well


(Same as 1st verse)
My buckets filled
And its got no leaks
The means every drop I got of you girl
I'm gonna keep


(during the last verse switch between [ch]F#m[/ch], [ch]Bb[/ch] and [ch]B7[/ch]!!!)

Look at me, still hanging around
Still hangin around, Oh baby I'm still around
I'm still around...

End on [ch]F#m[/ch]

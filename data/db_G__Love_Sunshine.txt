Just repeat the chords where you hear the chord change,

Sunshine, shinin' down,
Come on we're gonna take a little walk around the woods
Don't care what we do as long as I'm with you
Every little thing is going to be alright.

Harmonica solo

I can't get enough I want to eat you up
I want to have you for dinner left over for lunch
Don't go. No don't go.
I love every little thing about you baby don't you know.

Oh I done you wrong what you've done me back
Taught me a lesson now i can't forget that
Don't go. Don't go.
I love every little thing about you baby don't you know.

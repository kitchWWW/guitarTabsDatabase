The rhythm is fairly easy to figure out

Lyrics:
we'll be like two birds singing in the moonlight
two fireflys lightin up the sky 
two stars shining through the clouds
two clouds floating in the sky

we'll be like the moon when the sun is rising
two bees buzzing round a flower
two crickets singing...
two roses budding in the spring time

we'll be like the rain fallin in the desert
the milky way and the north star
we'll be like two peas in a pod
we'll be of the same mind and god

we'll be in love
we'll be in love

[tab]*Play this riff instead of the main riff
e|---6-8-6---5-7-5---3-------------------|
B|---6-8-6---5-7-5---5-------------------|
G|---6-8-6---5-7-5---4-strum a few times-|
D|---6-8-6---5-7-5---5-------------------| Repeat x3
A|---5-7-5---4-6-4---3-------------------|
E|---6-8-6---5-7-5-----------------------|[/tab]

On the third repeat play slower and don't strum the last chord.

You can understand what I mean by listening to the song.

*Back to main riff
we'll be like two birds falling in love
we'll be like two birds falling in love
we'll be in love

[tab]*Play this riff as the outro (similar to the riff above)

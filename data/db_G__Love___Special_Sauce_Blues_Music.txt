ah how me and my band
all must agree we like to get groovy
with the sounds of the old time
we like to jam cause man
sounds from the bandstand
hand for the cause man
hang from the old ones
the tones the gears the props and the rides very much in
chillin outside
way back...
from where music really started
I'm a child of the eighties
from where i departed since then i started
a collection of the people
who started it all
I reckon therefor
I kept them
in my sock like money
blues music...

it's all about rockin the van not rock to roll
but sway to sway
shocks work out I play
what that fly girl Sabine say...
about eight miles to the gallon that's some
hiway sailing
cool cool lounging
Atlantic City bounding
1920's to the 1970's a stream with some
pool solid steady
getting ready real cool
the earth amp sock hat hihat dope
Dobro D'Addario strings for my things
the bass wail sings
let the rhyme bring
the tense of the time
of the old time
blues music

blind lemon Jefferson and juice
B.M.W.'s the proof frosty Albert Collins bukkha white
Booker T. James Brown
Jimmy Smith at the console
the soul with the girls Aretha
Chakka Khan the show Solid Gold
Cisco and Sonny and Lead Belly too
peoples that rode with Woody and you Bob Dylan
a million Sears Silvertone guitars
heard the licks no need to take them nowhere
blues music

it's like chewing gum with your headphones on
like drinking lemonade
or chilling on the front porch after running ball
like you lost a twenty dollar bill
you got a free ticket from the scratch and win
it's like the swimsuit issue
I think I need a tissue?
it's like you and your baby got nasty cut off and left
     alone now making eyes
on the city bus again grandma cooks blueberry pie
little sister got a boyfriend
it's like smoking the ride
the final right
the vinyl rides
blues music...

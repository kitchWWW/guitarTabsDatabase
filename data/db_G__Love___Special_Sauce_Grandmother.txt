G               C7            G               C7

Aint nothing like the taste of her sweet sweet blueberry pie. 
G                        C7           
Tears are falling from my eyes, 
G                               C7
Wipe them away child don't you cry
G            C7            G                C7
Grandmother I know you've seen it all

Jars for the tadpoles, and the frogs from the lake 
G                          C7         
Mind your manners at the table. 
G                         C7          
Won't you child for heaven sake
G                        A        
And I know that you're gone, 
Bb                       C
But I feel like your reading my mind. 
G                     A   
And I know I was lost 
Bb                         C
But then, surely, you showed me a sign. 
C
Showed me, you showed me, showed me, you showed me, showed me, you showed me a sign.

And if you skinned your knee, 
G                       C7   
Sit down by the fireside bright. 
G                     C7                  G                          C7
Hold your Grandma's loving hands every thing gonna be alright
G              A
And I know that you're gone, 
Bb                       C
But I feel like your reading my mind. 
G            A
And I know I was lost 
Bb                        C
But then, surely, you showed me a sign. 
C
Showed me, you showed me, showed me, you showed me, showed me, you showed me a sign.
G         C7            G            C7
Grandmother I know you've seen it all

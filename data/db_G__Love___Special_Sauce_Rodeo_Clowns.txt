[Beat only]
Yo, wus' up?
This is G-Love coming at you live  out here from California,
Even though I'm Philly born and bred

And I got my man Jack Johnson in the studio today,
we just got out of the surf
My man, Jack, tell 'em what time it is

Sweeping the floors, open up the doors, yeah[/tab]

[tab][ch]C#m7[/ch]
Bright lights flashing to cover up your lack of[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F#7[/ch]
So many people, so many problems, so many reasons[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A7[/ch]
To buy another round, drink it down[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G#7[/ch]
Just another night on the town[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]C#m7[/ch]
With the big man, money man, better than the other man[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#7[/ch]
He got the plan with the million dollar give a damn[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
When nobody understands, he'll become a smaller man[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G#7[/ch]
The bright lights keep flashing man the women keep on dancing[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C#m7[/ch]                          [ch]G#7[/ch]

The shots of Tequila, man they'll say that they need ya[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A7[/ch]                                    [ch]G#7[/ch]
But what they really need,     is just a little room to breath[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]C#m7[/ch]
Teeny bopping disco queen, she barely understands[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#7[/ch]
Her dreams of bellybutton rings and other kinds of things[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A7[/ch]
Symbolic of change but the thing that is strange[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G#7[/ch]
Is that the changes occurred, and now she's just a part of[/tab]

[Chorus]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C#m7[/ch]
Lights out, shut down, late night, wet ground[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#7[/ch]
   You walk by look at him but he can't look at you, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
   You might feel pity but he only feels the ground because-uh[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#7[/ch]
  You understand moods, but he only knows let down[/tab]

[tab][ch]C#m7[/ch]
   By the corner there's another one[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#7[/ch]
Reaching out a hand, coming from a broken man, well[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
   You try to live but he's done trying[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#7[/ch]
   Not dead but definitely[/tab]

[Chorus]

[ the intro bridge part i have written out here is just a guide, ]
[ really; you get the idea --near the 3 minute mark (a bit before]
[ the "coast to coast to coast" part) he repeats the ascending   ]
[ lick on the D string { D|--5-6-7-5-6-7-5-6-7-| }. the verse is ]
[ just a free strum on the A and D/A chords (sometimes he plays  ]
[ 7th chords (A: x 0 7 6 7 0 | D/A: x 0 7 7 7 8) and sometimes   ]
[ he plays them open --he appregiates them before the "lovin' it"]
[ part.                                                          ]

all the transcriptions (from coast to coast) will have the lyrics,
since the liner notes don't have 'em.

and they just don't know
where we are to begin

ever since i been a small fish
oh yeah oh cmon

lova that,  (ya got to love that)
pushin it   (pushin' it)
shoving it, (shovin' it)
kicking it, (and we're kicking it)
licking it, (and we're licking it)
looka that,         [             ]
cooka that,         [   as above  ]
kicking it,         [             ]

you watch out for the sharks and the barracuda too
you watch out for the big fish they all try to eat you
you watch out for the fisher man and the hook-line and the sinker
and you watch out for the jellyfish, cos they all tentacle get you

ever since that i been a small fish,
oh yeah ...

drummer man (drum solo)

we go from coast to coast to coast to coast to coast
we go we go from coast to coast to coast to coast to coast
i said i go from coast to coast to coast to coast to coast
you gotta go from coast to coast to coast to coast to coast
yeah and from sea to shining sea
 ever since that i been a small fish (watch out...)

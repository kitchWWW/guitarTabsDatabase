     riff 1                riff 2[/tab]

notes:
verse is basically various parts of the Bbm7 chord with variations of riff
1. at the first two sometimes the bend is on the 9th fret of the B-string
on the breakbown let each note ring out to make it more harmonic
and on the chorus just rock it how you feel it

intro: Bbm7 w/ riff 1  (4x)

verse 1:
Bbm7
I'll always have myself, a freak to tell a tale
sittin' on a stair, which way to find someone
lookin' around the city, lookin' for my picture
i lost my money and my wallet at the bar with my mind so
oh mister can you find, miss did you see me
strange things' faces in the places i've gots to be
sometimes (bend)
you know what's on my mind (riff 1)
sometimes (bend)
you know what's on my mind (riff 1)

breakdown (2x)

verse 2:
Bbm7
everywhere's i go, it's true i've got to go on my own
need someone to warm my soul, what to warm
i get a bowl of soup, i fell warm ifeel warm
i'm asking to a alley cat, don't tell me nothing
one thing i sees peoples they mean
lookin for my brother, my brothers they're all gone
gone to drive, i drive to stay alive

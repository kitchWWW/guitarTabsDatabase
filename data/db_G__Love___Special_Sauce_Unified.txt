Now come on everyone on this place come together[/tab]

Wouldn't it be nice if we could all live together forever

Finding our peach in unity

Destroying the noting of foolish vanities

Pull to rise

Lift the blinds

The funky dope is here in 1999

And we're praising so we're raising out of this oblivion

And on And on And on And on And on And on And on And on

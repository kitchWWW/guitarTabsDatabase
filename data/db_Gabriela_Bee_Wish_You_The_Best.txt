[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
 I've realized that you might never change and that's okay[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
 And I could name a million things I wish that I could say[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
Like you're a drag, and you know you could never take a joke[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
And you hate that I'm happier now that I let you go, ah[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                             [ch]G[/ch]
 You're out of mind, you're out of sight, and now it's far too late[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I wish you the best, wish you the best[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Wish you the best, even though you're not[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
I'm wishin' you well, wishin' you well[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Wishin' you well, even though you're not[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
And I might miss you a little bit, think of you a little bit fondly[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You'll never say it but you'll always be sorry[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I wish you the best, wish you the bеst[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Wish you the best, evеn though you're not[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]
 It's 2 AM and I found myself still smiling at the wall[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
 Just thinking of the lovely way I had to send you off[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
But now I'm glad that I see what you meant to me[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I wonder what I'd be like if I never set you free, ah[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
 Lesson learned, I finally found myself but after all[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I wish you the best, wish you the best[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Wish you the best, even though you're not[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
I'm wishin' you well, wishin' you well[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Wishin' you well, even though you're not[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
And I might miss you a little bit, think of you a little bit fondly[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You'll never say it but you'll always be sorry[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I wish you the best, wish you the bеst[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Wish you the best, evеn though you're not[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I'm walking down a cobblestone street[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
I hear the drums begin to beat[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch]
And I see a soldier in blue[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
And I begin to think he's so strong[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
How could he keep on going for so long[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I think to myself[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Why can't we be like the soldier in blue[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Why can't we do what we're supposed to do[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Why can't we act and talk alike[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Why can't we put up without a fight[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
I start to think how hard this life would be[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Wouldn't he ever miss his family[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
I feel bad for the soldier in blue[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
And I start to think why only one[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
Why can't we have both love and be strong[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]                                        [ch]Em[/ch]
If that's the truth, there's really no point trying to[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Why can't we be like the soldier in blue[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Why can't we do what we're supposed to do[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Why can't we act and talk alike[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Why can't we put up without a fight[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
When did he decide that this was a good life[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
That this was the life we're supposed to live[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Through all the emotions[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
Through all the sadness[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
He keeps on going on[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Does he ever feel deprived[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Why can't we be like the soldier in blue[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Why can't we do what we're supposed to do[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Why can't we act and talk alike[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Why can't we put up without a fight[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
And be like the soldier in blue[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
There's a soldier in you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Just gotta look for it[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F#m[/ch]
You'll find it someday[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Soon[/tab]

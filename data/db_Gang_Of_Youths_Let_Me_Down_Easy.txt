[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch] [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You want someone who wants you for who you are[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
I want someone to try and let me down easy, easy tonight[/tab]

Easy, easy tonight

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Honey, it's no secret that with matters of the heart[/tab]

Unreserved, I'm irrational and rarely ever star
[tab]             [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
But since the world's dark and often inhumane[/tab]

We relish our condition, come drinking in the rain
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
Cause do you remember when, after Paris[/tab]

We all decided the best way to fight it was
[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Drink wine, dance, heal and pray[/tab]

And make love that lasts with a vengeance
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
So you can join the cowards all aboard the outrage train[/tab]
[tab]                                                         [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
You can stay afraid, or slit the throat of fear and be brave[/tab]

And scratch a little itch 'til you're moving like a motherfucker

Up in this bitch

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You wanted to fight for a cause?[/tab]

Then go out and fall in love
[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Don't stop, don't stop believing[/tab]

In truth, and grace in the grievance
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You want someone to want you for who you are[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
I want someone to try or let me down easy, easy tonight[/tab]

Easy, easy tonight

[ch]D[/ch] [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]

[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
So look at me and tell me what I already know[/tab]

That I trialled and I failed and it's good to let it go
[tab]             [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
And sometimes life sucks and everything is lame[/tab]

Not everything's as easy as making lemonade
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
And so dismembering our state of balance[/tab]

With lust requited, a gaze undivided
[tab]      [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
With a cool mind, warmth in your face[/tab]

A good heart, grace under pressure
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Give me a good reason to be heartsick again[/tab]
[tab]                                                    [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
To be here, to be strong, to be oddly and boldly estranged[/tab]

From a loss and bitter years

I found myself descending into tedium and fear

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You wanted to fight for a cause?[/tab]

Then go out and fall in love
[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Don't stop, don't stop believing[/tab]

In truth and grace in the grievance
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You want someone to want you for who you are[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
I want someone to try or let me down easy, easy tonight[/tab]

Easy, easy tonight

[Instrumental]
[ch]D[/ch] [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
[ch]A[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]  (x2)

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
If it's late, you're drunk and wanting[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
A reason, some reason to live[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]
I always, I always say[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Just put on some Whitesnake[/tab]

[ch]D[/ch]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Honey, it's no secret that I've been losing my way[/tab]

In the weirdest of moments and the stupidest of ways
[tab]        [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
But hey, I'm still young, and it's gonna be okay[/tab]

I got solipsism, baby, and I brought lemonade
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
I'll surrender then, all my balance[/tab]

And be excited and drink to tonight
[tab]          [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
It's not a bad time, time spent with you[/tab]

There's cool lights, and songs with good lyrics
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
We never have to talk again, whatever, up to you[/tab]

But since you're putting up with me
[tab]                         [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Here's another toast just to you[/tab]

Let's dance off the beat

Then mosey out together and say goodbye on the street

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You wanted to fight for a cause?[/tab]

Then go out and love someone
[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Don't stop, don't stop believing[/tab]

In truth and personal freedom
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I want someone to want me for who I am[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
I want someone to try or let me down easy, easy tonight[/tab]

Easy, easy tonight

[Outro]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Easy, easy tonight[/tab]

Easy, easy tonight
[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Easy, easy tonight[/tab]

Easy, easy tonight

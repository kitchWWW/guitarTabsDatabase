ME ABOUT YOU
As recorded by Garry Bonner
(1967 single release)



[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Perhaps another time or maybe another place[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]C[/ch]
Could've eased my mind, would've never seen your face[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Or heard about you[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
But now you call my name and you're reality[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Though it's hard to explain, I know I'll never be[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Without you[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
I know nothing about you[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
But I know I don't doubt your love and I know that it's real[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
By God above I know how I feel[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
About you[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Got a handful of gold and a pocketful of dreams[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
But a heart full of love and I know what it means[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
To be without you[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Come sit by my side and share with me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
All the feelings inside and the things you see[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
About you[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
I'd always known you'd be here today[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
Waiting for me; now the time is right, so you'll hear me say[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
That for all my life I will always stay[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
About you[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
About you[/tab]

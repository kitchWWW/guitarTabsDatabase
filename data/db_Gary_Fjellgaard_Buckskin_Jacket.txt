[CAPO 2]

[Intro]
[ch]F[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab]   [ch]Bb[/ch]                                     [ch]F[/ch]
In her upstairs room she sits beside the window[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
Starin till she just can't see no more[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                                     [ch]F[/ch]
Has it been a year or has it been forever[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]
Since that cowboy left to fight that crazy war[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]Eb[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
So she wraps herself inside his buckskin jacket[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]Bb[/ch]
You know the one that smells of horse and honest sweat[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Eb[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
He was after all just a workin cowboy[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Eb[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
She loved that boy with everything she had[/tab]

[Instrumental]
[ch]F[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]

[Verse 2]
[tab]  [ch]Bb[/ch]                               [ch]F[/ch]
Freedom was one thing they always counted on[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                                     [ch]Bb[/ch]
Worth fighting for that's what they believed[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bb[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]
When a poster said we need more able bodies[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                                      [ch]Bb[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]
He just looked at her and said they must mean me[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]Eb[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
He said one last night before I have to leave you[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Eb[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]
If I have to go and fight I'll fight to win[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Eb[/ch]                                [ch]Bb[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
He left the upstairs room while she lay sleeping[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Eb[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
With his buckskin coat against her naked skin[/tab]

[Instrumental]
[ch]F[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]

[Verse 3]
[tab] [ch]Bb[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]
He wasn't much for sentimental letters[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
But he wrote to her as faithful as can be[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bb[/ch]                                [ch]F[/ch]
He said a cowboy who never took to water[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]Bb[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]
Ain't it funny how I ended up at sea[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]Eb[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]Bb[/ch]
For three long months that crazy war's been over[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Eb[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]Bb[/ch]
She wonders if she'll spend her life alone[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Eb[/ch]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
Then she heard familiar footsteps in the hallway[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Eb[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]Bb[/ch]
By some miracle her cowboy made it home[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Eb[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
So she wraps herself inside his buckskin jacket[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]Bb[/ch]
You know the one that smells of horse and honest sweat[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Eb[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
He was after all just a workin cowboy[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Eb[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
She loved that boy with everything she had[/tab]

[Instrumental]

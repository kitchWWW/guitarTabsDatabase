[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]F#m[/ch]         [ch]E7[/ch]
A jolly old santa maybe just one or two[/tab]

And here by the fire with my heart’s desire[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]F#m[/ch]         [ch]E7[/ch]
I count all my blessing I have more than a few[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]E7[/ch]

Is when I have one more Christmas with you[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
There were times when you carried me over a mountain[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                                [ch]E7[/ch]
There were times when I cried like a babe in your arms[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Every Christmas you give me the gift of a lifetime[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                                [ch]E7[/ch]
And all that you ask for is love in return[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
That our children won’t fire a weapon in anger[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                                [ch]E7[/ch]
That they have compassion for the hungry and cold[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
That our rivers would run just as pure as we found them[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Dm[/ch]                                [ch]E7[/ch]
And Christmas would be not just tinsel and bows[/tab]

These are my wishes that I want for Christmas[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]F#m[/ch]         [ch]E7[/ch]
If all that I ask for only one wish came true[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]E7[/ch]

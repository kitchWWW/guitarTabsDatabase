[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A7[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 1]

I swore I'd drown your memory
[tab]   [ch]A7[/ch]
In the devil's amber brew[/tab]

And wash away the living hell
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
I'm daily going through[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D7[/ch]
I'd drink till I become a fool[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
And think you're not around[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]
But memories swim in whiskey[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D7[/ch]
They don't ever drown[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Memories swim in whiskey[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
To punish those who think[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
That they can make them disappear[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E7[/ch]                  [ch]A7[/ch]
With one more round of drinks[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
You're always there just underneath[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Each swallow you put down[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]
Memories swim in whiskey[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
They don't ever drown[/tab]

[ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A7[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 2]

You'd think by now I've paid enough
[tab] [ch]A7[/ch]
To keep you in the past[/tab]

But here you are as big as life
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
Warming up my glass[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]G[/ch]
I hold my drink in my hand[/tab]

Watch you whirl around
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]
Cause memories swim in whiskey[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
They don't ever drown[/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Memories swim in whiskey[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
To punish those who think[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
That they can make them disappear[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E7[/ch]                  [ch]A7[/ch]
With one more round of drinks[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
You're always there just underneath[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Each swallow you put down[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]
Memories swim in whiskey[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
They don't ever drown[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
It's been a long week morning[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
I dug into last night[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
And I just laid down these demons[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
'cause I couldn't put up a fight[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
And it's hard for me to say[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
I got a problem with me[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
I got one life to live[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
Better quit living like I got three[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]D[/ch]
Well I've been hunting and running[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
It's been coursing through my veins[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
And there ain't one thing about me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
That I will ever change[/tab]

[Post-Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
And it's hard for me to say[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
I got a problem with me[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
I got one life to live[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
Better quit livin' like I got three[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
It's been a mind wrenching evening[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
I've been hurting and a grieving[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
About all the cash I spend[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Don't know if I make the rent[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
And it's hard for me to say[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
I got a problem with me[/tab]

[Chorus]

I've been held down in some beer[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
And I loved a coupled women[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
And the world just keeps a-spinnin'[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
But I donâ€™t have me a while[/tab]

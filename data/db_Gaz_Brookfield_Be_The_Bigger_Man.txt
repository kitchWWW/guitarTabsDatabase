[Verse 1]
(Single strum)
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Sorry son, you've got to go to school again today[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em7[/ch]
'Cause if you don't get educated you will never find your way[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I know it doesn't seem it's worth it at the moment but it's true[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]D7[/ch]
These are the best days of your life my boy, now would I lie to you?[/tab]

(Full strumming pattern from here)
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
So grab your lunch and text books, get your arse out of the door[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em7[/ch]
And I'll drop you at the gate where I've dropped you a thousand times before[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Do your best to learn some lessons, have some fun and make some friends[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]D7[/ch]
You've only got a few years left and you will thank me in the end[/tab]


[Chorus 1]
[tab]                 [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I know it's hard[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
But don't cry[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
'Cause these things are sent to try[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]           (Hold [ch]D[/ch] here) [ch]G[/ch]
I know you find it hard to see but you are always gonna be the bigger man[/tab]


[Verse 2]
G cont. into quick muted strum.

(Single strum)
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Thing is dad you never see what happens when you go[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em7[/ch]
I become the primary target for every bully that I know[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
You always taught me that the best way to avoid a bully's fist[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]D7[/ch]
Is to ignore them and they'll move along but that's not true, is it[/tab]

(Full strumming pattern)
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
So I accept my daily beating with a minimum of fuss[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em7[/ch]
And accept the fact that that's just how it goes for kids like us[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
For the moderately intelligent or slightly overweight[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]D7[/ch]
The best years of your life might not be all that fucking great[/tab]


[Chorus 2]
[tab]                 [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I know it's hard[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
But I won't cry[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
'Cause these things are sent to try[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]         (Hold [ch]D[/ch] here)  [ch]G[/ch]
But I find it hard to see how I am ever gonna be the bigger man[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I never stood a chance, did I...[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
The overweight religious kid with four eyes...[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Everything that they put me through...[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Made me a bigger man than all of you![/tab]

[Verse 3]
(Single strum)
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Then one day two decades on I'm drinking in the pub[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em7[/ch]
And a guy that used to kick my arse at school just wanders up[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
He tries to be all nice to me as if everything had changed[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]      N.C.                [ch]D7[/ch] (Full strumming pattern)
I grabbed the fucker by the throat and I carefully explained[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
That a decade of sustained mental and physical abuse [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em7[/ch]
At the hands of him and all his friends has unsurprisingly produced[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
A good deal of repressed resentment and the tendency to snap[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]D7[/ch]
No, I don't wanna be your friend, how could you ever have thought that?[/tab]


[Chorus 3]
[tab]                       [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I thought you were hard[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
So don't cry[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
'Cause these things are sent to try[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
And that fear you're feeling now is no comparison to how[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
You made me feel at school but I won't stoop to being cruel[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
No, I'll walk away in peace[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
'Cause I'm always gonna be the bigger man[/tab]

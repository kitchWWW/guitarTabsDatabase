Hey :) I asked Gaz for the tabs for this when I met him at Glastonbury this year, and he told me:
Intro: [ch]Em[/ch]
Verse: [ch]Em[/ch] | [ch]G[/ch] | [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Chorus 1: [ch]C[/ch] | [ch]Em[/ch] (x3) | [ch]C[/ch] | [ch]Am[/ch]
Chorus 2: [ch]C[/ch] | [ch]Em[/ch] (x3) | [ch]C[/ch] | [ch]Am[/ch] | [ch]D[/ch]
[tab]Instrumental: [ch]Em[/ch] | [ch]D/F#[/ch] | [ch]G[/ch]
I fiddled around until I found a way to play it that fits roughly with this version he did: [/tab]

Intro: Em x3


[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D/F#[/ch]
That old dog knows how to find me [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D/F#[/ch]
It matters not which road I travel on [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D/F#[/ch]
And I thought those days were behind me [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D/F#[/ch]
But it turns out I could not have been more wrong [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D/F#[/ch]
And he sits right there on my shoulder [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D/F#[/ch]
His cold, wet breath upon my neck [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D/F#[/ch]
And they said he would leave when I got older [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D/F#[/ch]
But he still creeps up when I least expect [/tab]

[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
And it's hard to say why it has to be today [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
And I can't explain how it feels [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
But a black dog day could be just one sleep away [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]Em[/ch]
And I'll never see him coming but I'll keep running with him snapping at my heels [/tab]


[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D/F#[/ch]
And there's no good reason for his visits [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D/F#[/ch]
He requires neither catalyst nor cause [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D/F#[/ch]
And he'll push me to my very limits [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Leaving nothing but the scars left by his claws [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D/F#[/ch]
And he steals the wind right out my sails [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D/F#[/ch]
And he leaves me at the mercy of the waves [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D/F#[/ch]
And I've tried but I have failed to outrun him [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D/F#[/ch]
But I'm not fast enough on my feet to escape [/tab]


[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
And it's hard to say why it has to be today [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
And I can't explain how it feels [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
But a black dog day could be just one sleep away [/tab]

And I'll never see him coming but I'll keep running with him snapping at my heels [/tab]
      Em     Em D/F#      D/F# G      G D/F#    (switch quickly between the ones that are closer together)
At my heels

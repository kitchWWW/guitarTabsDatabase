A Street Called Hope  

Intro:  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
I took a room in a house of gloom[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch] 
Somewhere I could hide my soul[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
There I hoped to find a way to ease my mind[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
Couldn't face the gloom tomorrow[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
I sat until the hours of three or four[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]     
Thinking doesn't help but seems[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
I crept to bed and cried myself to sleep once more[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]E7[/ch]
Then I had the wildest dream[/tab]

Chorus:
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]Dm[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
(Street called Hope) in a town named Freedom[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]E7[/ch] 
Where each clock is pointed to the hour of love[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
Upon a street called Hope at the house of Welcome[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]E7[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
That's where she opened the door of love[/tab]

When I awoke the following day
Every doubt had left my mind
My dream it taught me what the prophets say
Those who seek will always find

I ran down the stair and out in to the street
Looking for the nearest phone
We both said sorry and decided to meet
To find ourselves a happy home

Chorus (repeat and fade)

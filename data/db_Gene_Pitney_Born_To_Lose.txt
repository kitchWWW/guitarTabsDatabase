Born to Lose

[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                [ch]G#[/ch]       [ch]Bb[/ch]      [ch]Eb[/ch]
Born to lose I've lived my life in vein[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G#[/ch]             [ch]G#sus4[/ch]     [ch]Eb[/ch]
Every dream has only brought me pain[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Eb7[/ch]                      [ch]G#[/ch]
All my life I've always been so blue[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bb7[/ch]                     [ch]Eb7[/ch]
Born to lose and now I'm losing you[/tab]

Born to lose it seems so hard to bear
How I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through
Born to lose and now I'm losing you

Born to lose my every hope is gone
It's so hard to face an empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew
Born to lose and now I'm losing you

THE LIFE OF JOHN

[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
On the sidewalks of Chicago[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
While delivering  the mail[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
With verses running through his head[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Through the wind and rain and hail[/tab]


[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Playin folk clubs every night[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Working on his route come dawn[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
A singing rhyming mailman[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
That was the life of John[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Steve Goodman and Kristofferson[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
Said he had what it took[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
To make it down in New York[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
So he thought he’d take a look[/tab]


[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And when he opened at the Bitter End[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
The moment he went on[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Began to spread the legend[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
That became the life of John[/tab]


[Bridge]

[tab][ch]D7[/ch]
Now some folks crave the spotlight[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And others put on airs[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
But for him it was the music[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
And the soul that he laid bare[/tab]


[tab][ch]G[/ch]
It was the building of a legacy[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
That always will live on[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
In the stories and the songs he shared[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
That filled the life of John[/tab]


[Verse 3]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He never tried to chase the mainstream[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
He wouldn’t walk that road[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
He never lost his common touch[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Or the duty that he owed[/tab]


[tab][ch]G[/ch]
To celebrate the every man[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
And woman in his songs[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
And we hear our lives reflected[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
When we share the life of John[/tab]


[Bridge]

[tab][ch]D7[/ch]
Now I’m not gonna quote him[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Cause we all know the lines[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
We know the folks he wrote about[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
And how he’s left behind[/tab]


[tab][ch]G[/ch]
A world that’s so much better off[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
For all the lives he’s drawn[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
And we can all be thankful[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
For the words and life of John[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah we can all be thankful[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
For the words and life of John[/tab]

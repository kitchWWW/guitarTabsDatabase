Between My House And Town  

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
They finally got the nerve to tell me[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Youâ€™re no longer wanted hangin' around[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
I knew all along it would-a happened[/tab]
[tab]                                               [ch]D[/ch]                             
So there this-a new place, darlin', that I found.[/tab]

[Chorus:]

[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
And it's just on the outskirts of somewhere[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
The only traffic is downward bound[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
It's alright, to try our love 'cause I've been so far out[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
That the sun will go down between my house and town.[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
Please don't feel sorry darlin', 'cause you hurt me[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Love just moved away for your, your little man[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
I could feel this bad, bad day a-comin'[/tab]
[tab]                                               [ch]D[/ch] 
So there's this new place darlin', that I plan.[/tab]

[Chorus:]

[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
And it's just on the outskirts of somewhere[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
The only traffic is downward bound[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
It's alright, to try our love 'cause I've been so far out[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
That the sun will go down between my house and town.[/tab]

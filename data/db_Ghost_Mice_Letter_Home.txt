Letter Home
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
Dear Dad, I know you’re proud of me even though you’ve never said it well[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
I know you are, and I know that talking can be hard[/tab]

And I think I’ve proven myself to be naturally responsible
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]        
And I want my mustang back.  I want to cruise down Kirkwood,[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Make the other cruisers envy me[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
I want to rip down the highways, leave a cloud of jealousy[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
The car was nothing but a junk heap, when you bought it for me when I was [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Fourteen[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
We fixed it up together, and honestly I think you can fix anything[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
And I know you’re proud of me because I’m living my dreams[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
So please, please, please, don’t worry about me.  Please don’t worry about me[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]A[/ch] 
Dear mom, I know that you’re afraid[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
You’ve got every right to be, growing up with nothing to born to have a dream[/tab]

And I know there’s a crook inside of you, just dying to get out
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
And you would hide me from the cops, if they came knocking at your house[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
You would drive my getaway car, that’s just the way you are[/tab]


You’ve gotta mothers heart
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
You’ve gotta mothers heart[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]E[/ch]
You’ve gotta mothers heart[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]A[/ch]
You’ve gotta mothers heart[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
And I’m sorry that I’ve always forgot your birthday[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch] 
And you never forgot mine[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                                      [ch]D[/ch]
And I’m sorry that I haven’t given you any grandkids[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
And I’m sorry that I don’t have a wife[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
And I’m sorry that the way I live my life, isn’t the way you think is right[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
But you’ve raised me well, and I think I came out alright[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
Even though your ashamed of me for being such a thief[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
Well I know you still love me, and I admire your honesty[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
So please, please, please, don’t worry about me[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
Please don’t worry about me[/tab]

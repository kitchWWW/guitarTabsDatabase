[C]She's just the kind of girl who [F]thinks her life's a play
[C]She'll quote the script all night then [F]re-write it all day

She's a kinda [G]girl  [Ab]
She's a kinda [G]girl
Like a [F]nightmare is a kinda dream

Verse 2:
[C]She's like a movie that you [F]stare at late at night
[C]Her lips are moving but the [F]words won't synch up right
[Bb]Just when she [C]screams she can't [F]take a[F/E]nother [Dm]hour [C]
She's [Bb]singing in the [Eb]hallway and [Ab]dancing in the shower

Chorus

Bridge:

[Am] E[Em]ventuall[F]y.....You'll wake up with a start
[Am] E[Em]ventuall[F]y.....You'll [F]recognize all around
The [G]pieces of the lives she blew apart

[C]You open up your mouth but you [F]won't get a straight word in
She's [Bb]on the phone for [C]hours when you'd [F]rather [F/E]get

   her in the street

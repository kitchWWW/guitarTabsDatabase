[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
I saw roses choking in the grass flaking paint in a broken window pane[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
A mailbox barely standin' by the driveway, I can almost read  the name[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                                               [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]
A swing set and forgotten toys where little girls and boys played happy games[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D7[/ch]
Everything I ever cared about is gone now but the memories still remain[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
And the old man from the house across the street asked how's it goin' and I said fine[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]D7[/ch]
The expression on his face would make me think that he could almost read my mind[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                                                                    [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]
That Johnson boy from down the road was asking if the kids could comе and play[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Lord, I wish I could have told him yes but I just said I guess son not today[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I just camе home to count the memories I've been counting in my mind[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Just came home to count the memories of a better day and time[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                                        [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
All the birds that sang such pretty songs aren't singing like they did when we were here[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]D7[/ch]
Cause there's no happiness in music if somebody isn't close enough to care[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                                                        [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]
So I picked arranged daisy from its home in the corner of the yard[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]D7[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
He loves me, he loves me not, I don't have to wonder anymore[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]G7[/ch]
I just came home to count the memories I've been counting in my mind[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Just came home to count the memories of a better day and time[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]G7[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
Just came home to count the memories, guess it's time to say goodbye[/tab]

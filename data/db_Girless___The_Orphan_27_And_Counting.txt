[Verse]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
This little city saw us young[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
while playing football in the park[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]                               [ch]F#m[/ch]
and getting fines for parking motorbikes on grass fields[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
when afternoons were truly droll[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
while drinking beer and smoking pot[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]                                [ch]F#m[/ch]
in the old rope-yard with grim dogs barking away[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
we used to put together shitty bands[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
to play some shitty songs[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]F#m[/ch]
singing about dirty jokes and violent moshpits[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
and if you'd tell me "one day we will play[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
our songs so far from home"[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
guess what? I wouldn't laugh at you again[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch]
I wouldn't laugh at you again[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
This little city saw us lonely and burning[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
losers with nice thoughts and pretty faces[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]F#m[/ch]
perfect friends but awful lovers[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
"Something to write home about"[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
and other records that we used to love[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]F#m[/ch]
Were our only bedroom company[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
and "summer wind was always our song"[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
was always our song as we thought[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F#m[/ch]
we should get a girl or something[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
and if you'd tell me "one day we will aim[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
and find the perfect one"[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]                              [ch]F#m[/ch]
guess what? I wouldn't laugh at you again[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch]
I wouldn't laugh at you again[/tab]

[Chorus]
[ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch]
You got me older  [x2][/tab]

[Instrumental] x2

[Verse]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
So years go by and people change[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
but some of them they stay the same[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]                                   [ch]F#m[/ch]
and we're the same boys who take roots in smoking areas[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
so you can find us anytime[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
with the same drink in the same bar[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
at the same hour, with the same people at the table[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
we've been drunk and we've been happy[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
we've been drunk and we've been sad[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
we've been drunk and we've been miserable on sundays[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]    
and if you'd tell me "one day we will slog[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
to drink the weekend off"[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
guess what? i wouldn't laugh at you again[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
And now we're older but not bolder[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
we look back but not in anger[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
we still live the same things and the same feelings[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
some of us will marry soon and some of us will never will[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]F#m[/ch]
some of us will get divorced pretty early[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
some of us have pushed their lives abroad[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
but we still keep in touch[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
some of us will never leave these doleful places[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
and if you'd tell me "one day we'll grow up[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
just like everyone else"[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
guess what? i wouldn't laugh at you again[/tab]

[Chorus]
[ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch]
You got me older[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch]
you got me older[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch]
You got us older[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch]
you got us older[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]A[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]Dmaj7sus2[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]N.C.          [ch]A[/ch]
That woman, hit my Honda Civic[/tab]

Called me a bitch when she did it
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
Now I'm spread out on the ground[/tab]

Fire man can't hold me down
[tab]        [ch]Dmaj7sus2[/ch]
But I'm questioning and thinking[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]A[/ch]
Of the last time that I think I saw ya[/tab]

[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Right now I can't think of any cures[/tab]

They could bury me in silver
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
You did surgery on my mind[/tab]

I think about you all the time
[tab]       [ch]Dmaj7sus2[/ch]
And my history calls you a viper[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
Think I lost something inside ya[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]
I think I know you well[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Dmaj7sus2[/ch]
I'm something of a kiss and tell[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]
Concussion gives me dizzy spells[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
I think I set this for a long run[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Dmaj7sus2[/ch]
I talk about you now to everyone[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]
In case you haven't moved on, move on[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
When I was driving in Missouri[/tab]

Someone told me a ghost story
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
About a man without a face[/tab]

And that thought haunted me for days
[tab]          [ch]Dmaj7sus2[/ch]
I'm still questioning and thinking[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]A[/ch]
Of th–µ last time that I thought I saw ya[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]
I think I know you well[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Dmaj7sus2[/ch]
I'm something of a kiss and tell[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]
Concussion gives me dizzy spells[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
I think I set this for a long run[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Dmaj7sus2[/ch]
I talk about you now to everyone[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]
In case you haven't moved on, moved on[/tab]

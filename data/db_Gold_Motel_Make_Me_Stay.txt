[You should know the chords now]

Making up, I leave before the night's over.
Walking down the streets as all the shops open.
And I'm trying not to let it show.
Everyone who sees me surely knows.

Won't you change my mind?
I don't know better than to run from love
in any measure.
Won't you change my heart?
I'm leaving today.
Oh, won't you change my mind and make me stay?

Won't you change my mind?
I don't know better than to run from love
in any measure.
Won't you change my heart?
I'm leaving today.
Oh, won't you make me stay?
Won't you make me stay?
Won't you make me stay?

Verse
I could bet on New Years eve he'd call me up at night.
From the other side of the world Ed was always there allright.
Ed's got the looks of a moviestar. Ed's got the smile of a prince
He rides a bike instead of a car. I wanna be his friend.
Dancing in the livingroom with the ladies so nice.
Like a child with the wisdom true, he's just a friend of mine.
Ed's got the rings and the colours. Ed's got the wind in his hair
He goes riding with the brothers. He's got a fist in the air.

Chorus
Going to the run, run, angel.
Going to the run, run, angel.
And heaven and hell came together that night only for you this time.
Going to run, forever, Angel

Verse
One summer at the festival holding on real tight.
On the back of a Harley he took me for a ride in the sky.
Ed's got the looks of a moviestar. Ed's got the smile of a prince
He rides a bike instead of a car. I’ll always be his friend.

Chorus
Going to the run, run, angel.
Going to the run, run, angel.
And his wings started to shine so bright, like a fire in the night.
Going to run, forever, Angel
Going to the run, run, angel.
Going to the run, run, angel.
And heaven and hell came together that night only for you this time.
Going to run, forever, Angel
Going to run, forever, Angel

[tab][ch]D[/ch]       
When I walk beside her [/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I am the better man[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
When I look to leave her [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
I always stagger back again[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Once I built an Ivory tower [/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
so I could worship from above[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And when I climbed down to be set free [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
she took me in again[/tab]

CHORUS
[tab][ch]D[/ch]       
there's a big[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am7[/ch]
A big hard sun[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
beaten on the big people[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
in the big hard world[/tab]
END CHORUS

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
When she comes to greet me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
She is mercy at my feet[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
When I stay to pillage her[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
She just throws it back at me[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Once I dug an early grave [/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
To find a better land[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
She just smiled and laughed at me [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
And took her blues back again[/tab]

CHORUS X2

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
When I go to cross that river[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
She is comfort by my side[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
When I try to understand[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
She just opens up her hands[/tab]

INSTRUMENTAL BREAK
CHORUS

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Once I stood to lose her[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
And when I saw what I had done[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Burned down and threw away the hours[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
of her garden and her sun[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
so I tried to warn her[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
And turned to see her weep[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
40 days and 40 nights[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
and it's still coming down on me[/tab]

Had you thinkin' you were so fine[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
You’ve been keepin’ thizz poppin’ in my sideline[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]
‘cause I’m too scared to take a chance[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
Hate to see you’re falling for me[/tab]

Used to wear my heart on my sleeve[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
everything is not what it seems[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]           [ch]Dm[/ch]  
Met a cute boy and he got cash[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
Real tall, and I like that[/tab]
He was in the back of my friends’ class
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
Real bool, so I let him pass[/tab]
Took it for a ride, shit ran fast
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
Never knew where was was going[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
Tried to slow it down, tried to make a dash[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]
When we crashed it was all bad,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
 all bad[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]
But it ain’t true, I should’ve thought this through[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]
Why is it I never seem to learn?[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]
I didn’t mean to lead you on[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
But it ain’t you, I should’ve thought this through[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]

That don’t bother me, I don’t mind
[tab]                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
You gotta learn love it hurts sometimes[/tab]
To say that I care it would just be a lie
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
You should have never wasted your time[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
And if we only got just one life[/tab]

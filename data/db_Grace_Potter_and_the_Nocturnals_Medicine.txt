[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                  
Policy woman got a hold on my baby[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch] 
Since she come around, he aint been the same [/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
She look at him with her dark brown eyes [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                               [ch]Bm[/ch]
She tell him things that would make a grown man cry [/tab]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
Policy woman took the love from my lover [/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
Hes been in a haze since the day that he saw her [/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
She shook her hips and her long black hair [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                           [ch]Bm[/ch]
Now all my baby does is stare at the gypsy woman [/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]
You like the way she makes you feel[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]Bm[/ch] 
She got you spinning on her medicine wheel [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
Shes crossing me with magnetic sand [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]F#m[/ch]
She hypnotize with her mojo hand [/tab]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
She got the medicine that everybody wants [/tab]
She got the medicine that everybody wants 
She got the medicine that everybody wants 
She got the medicine that everybody wants 


Policy woman came a rolling into town 
She got all the gentlemen to follow her down 
She found the diamonds hidden in the drain 
She disappeared on the ghost train 

You like the way that she makes you feel 
She got you spinning on her policy wheel 
Deep in the night, when no ones around 
Ive got a plan to take that woman down 

She got the medicine that everybody wants 
She got the medicine that everybody wants 
She got the medicine that everybody wants 
She got the medicine that everybody wants 

I stole her bag of rattling bones 
Her fast luck oil and her magic stones 
I swept up her magnetic sand 
I took her love potion and her mojo hand, now 

I got the medicine that everybody wants 
I got the medicine that everybody wants 
I got the medicine that everybody wants 
I got the medicine that everybody wants

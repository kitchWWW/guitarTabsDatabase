"Runaway" - Grace Potter


[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Oh oh oh oh oh[/tab]
Oh oh oh oh oh

[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
I hit you like a train[/tab]
You feel the pain
I ain't coming back
I cut you
Cut you deep
But you can't keep up on my truck
[tab]     [ch]Eb[/ch]
If I loved you I'd stick around[/tab]
Your on the ground
'Cause I knocked you down
[tab]           [ch]Gm[/ch]
And Your falling[/tab]
Every night
[tab]                                                           [ch]Eb[/ch]
That you can't fight that I can hear you pray[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Cm[/ch]                        [ch]Gm[/ch]
I'd stay just one more day[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]D7[/ch]                       [ch]Gm[/ch] - [ch]F[/ch] - [ch]Cm[/ch]
But I always runaway[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]Gm[/ch] - [ch]F[/ch] -     [ch]Eb[/ch] - [ch]D7[/ch]
I'm nothing but a runaway[/tab]

[Verse2]
I hooked you
With the beat
The heavy heat gettin' outta hand
And I loved you
In the lonely bed
The word you said, baby understand
That if I loved you, I would stay
I'd never stray then runaway
And I'll fall down
Lonely night, I can't fight
But maybe I should pray
Lord, give me the strength to stay

[Chorus]
'Cause I always runaway
I'm nothing but a runaway

Oh oh oh oh oh

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                                [ch]Gm[/ch]
Why can't I just stay in one place[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Eb[/ch]
Somebody got to put me in a cage[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Cm[/ch]                  
Oh, I don't want to be this way, oh[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]Gm[/ch]                    
I'm nothing, nothing[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D7[/ch]                                                 [ch]Gm[/ch] - [ch]F[/ch] - [ch]Cm[/ch]
Nothing but a runaway [chorus] [2x][/tab]
[tab]                                                                 [ch]Gm[/ch] - [ch]F/A[/ch] - [ch]Eb[/ch] - [ch]D7[/ch]
Ooooh, I'm nothing but a runaway[/tab]

(Verse)
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
I look around at the first signs of spring,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
willow trees pushing out leaves of light green.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
I got a cave in my backyard, reminds me of all the scary and dark.[/tab]

(Chorus*) 
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
Tennessee mountains and slade bottom streams,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
roll down my brain and float in my dreams.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
I'd never found an arrowhead before.[/tab]

There's a blue heron out there, he's eating snails.
Eats the whole thing, even the shells.
Walking through amaranth and black berry vines,
down by the water with a bottle of wine.

*Tennessee mountains and slade bottom streams,
roll down my brain and float in my dreams.
I'd never found an arrowhead before.

*Black eyed girl say see' my friend,
she gonna be there until the end,
but I'd never found an arrowhead before.

[ch]C[/ch] - [ch]G[/ch] - [ch]D[/ch] (x2)

You can make a stone path to the other side,
you can make waterfalls for the fairies to ride,
but when you get there I just hope you know
the dreams all around you and the rivers still flow.

*Got me a daughter and I got me a son,
I remember the days when I didn't have one,
but I'd never found an arrowhead before.

*Cut like a razor and it stab like a blade,
it'll kill anything that's ever been made.
Float through the wind and pierce the dark,
right through the skin, right through the heart.

But I'd never found an arrowhead before...

[ch]C[/ch] - [ch]G[/ch] - [ch]D[/ch] (x2)

I look around me and I wanna live,
got a farm in the country and a mortgage on the hill.
Come visit me, hell, it ain't that far.
We can go swimming right in the backyard.

*Tennessee mountains and slade bottom streams,
roll down my brain and float in my dreams.
I'd never found an arrowhead before.

*Tennessee mountains and slade bottom streams,
roll down my brain and float in my dreams.
I'd never found an arrowhead before.

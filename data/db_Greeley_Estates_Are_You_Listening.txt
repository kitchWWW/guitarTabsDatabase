Intro: Bbm--G#--C#--Eb


Verse 1: Sing
     Bbm      G#              C#
I've tried to tell you that I love you
Eb
  So many times before
Bbm       G#                  C#
You never let me be a part of your life
Eb
  If you only knew


Verse 2: Scream
     Bbm                 G#               C#
I've tried so hard to be someone that you want
Eb
  But now I'm through
    Bbm              G#                    C#
Did you forget about all the times that we had
Eb
  Where did they go


Chorus 1:
Cm-Eb-G#   Eb Bb  Cm
       Is any-one in there
     Eb  G#    Bb  Cm
Does this make any sense
               G#
It's so useless
   Eb  Bb G#
Trying to get your attention


Verse 3: Sing
   Bbm     G#               C#
So this is it what else can I do
Eb
  To show you how I feel
Bbm        G#                         C#
I could be drowning right in front of your eyes
Eb
  And you'd never know


Verse 4: Scream
    Bbm                   G#             C#
I'd give up everything to hold you in my arms
Eb
  For one last time
   Bbm                G#
If you choose to walk out that door then
    C#      Eb
I'm not I'm not in your way


Chorus 2:
Cm-Eb-G#   Eb Bb  Cm
       Is any-one in there
     Eb  G#    Bb  Cm
Does this make any sense
               G#
It's so useless
   Eb  Bb G#
Trying to get you to listen to me

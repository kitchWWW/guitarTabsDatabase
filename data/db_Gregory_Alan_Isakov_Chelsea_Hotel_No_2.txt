I remember you well from the Chelsea Hotel,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]
you were talking so brave and so sweet,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Cmaj9[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
giving me head on the unmade bed,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
while the limousines wait in the street.[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]
Those were the reasons and that was New York,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Cmaj9[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
we were running for the money and the flesh.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
And that was called love for the workers in song[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
probably still is for those of them left.[/tab]


[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]       
Ah but you got away, didn't you babe,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Cmaj9[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
you just turned your back on the crowd,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
you got away, I never once heard you say,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
I need you, I don't need you,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Cmaj9[/ch]
I need you, I don't need you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
and all of that jiving around.[/tab]

I remember you well from the Chelsea Hotel[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
you were famous, your heart was a legend.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]Cmaj9[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]          
You told me again you preferred handsome men[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
but for me you would make an exception.[/tab]


[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
And clenching your fist for the ones like us[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]Cmaj9[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
who are oppressed by the figures of beauty,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
you fixed yourself, you said, "Well never mind,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
we are ugly but we have the music."[/tab]

I don't mean to confess that I loved you the best,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]
I can't keep track of each fallen robin.[/tab]

Oh yeah,
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
After you made my day[/tab]
Hurts to know you're going away
Seems like my life begin to ruin
Now that you're departing pretty soon
But what more can I say, yeah
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Sad to know that you're leaving[/tab]
Even though it's kinda grieving
Sad to know that you're leaving
But I know that you'll return real soon
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
You can send me a postcard[/tab]
Mail it home to Do St Yard(?)
You know what loneliness brings
But Jah will guide you out and coming in
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
What more can I say[/tab]
Sad to know that you're leaving
Even though it's kinda grieving
Sad to know that you're leaving
But Jah will guide you out and coming in
Oh yeah

Oh yeah,

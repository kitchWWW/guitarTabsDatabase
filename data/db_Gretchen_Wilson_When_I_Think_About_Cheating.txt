When I Think About Cheating - Gretchen Wilson

[Intro]
[ch]A[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]

[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
I've never done anything [/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
That would ever bring a tear to your eye [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch] 
I've never crossed the line [/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]Fdim[/ch]
Or needed an alibi to cover up a lie[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]A7[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
But darlin I'll admit, there's been times when I could have[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
But the thing that kept me strong [/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]
Is the one thing that is always on my mind [/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
When i think about cheating[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch] 
I just think about you leavin[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Bm[/ch] 
And how my world would fall to pieces[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]E[/ch] 
If I tossed your love away [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]A/C#[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
Even when I'm tempted by some stranger [/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C#m[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch]
Oh there's never any danger [/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]  [ch]A/C#[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
I just think about you le---av---ing[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
When I think about cheating [/tab]

[Instrumental]
[ch]E[/ch]

[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
There was a time in Abilene[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A7[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch] 
When he said all the things I wanted to hear [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
It was hard to turn him down [/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]Fdim[/ch]
Between the champagne and the sound of whispers in my ear[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
But it just took one [/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A/C#[/ch]    [ch]Bm[/ch]
Two-step with someone and I was missing you [/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
He never had a chance, cause I broke up the dance [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]
Before the song was through[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]A/C#[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
And when I'm tempted by some stranger [/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C#m[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch]
Oh there's never any danger [/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]  [ch]A/C#[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
I just think about you le---av---ing[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
When I think about cheating[/tab]

[Outro]

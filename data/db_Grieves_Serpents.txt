CAPO 2


[Intro]Am [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]


[Verse 1:]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I was in the second grade when you pushed me out[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Third story window to the bushes down below[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Breathing in the cold[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]
As I tumbled through the vines' thorns smiling at my throat[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I, I saw the devil in you that day[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Looking down at me with that face[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
Smiling like you would have hid my body in the basement[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Body in the Basement[/tab]
[tab]                                              [ch]C[/ch]
But you got something that the world's been running from[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
For way too long and it's a sick twist[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]E[/ch]
A nervous little twitch[/tab]
Dragging the razors across my wrists
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                          [ch]C[/ch]
And you got something that the world's been trying to hide[/tab]
You're cyanide
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
Cause the only thing you told me was[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]E[/ch]
They'd never find my body in the basement[/tab]
Body in the basement, no

[Hook:]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                      [ch]C[/ch]
Every time I think about you know I go crazy[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]
People ask me about you[/tab]
I don't know what to say
[tab]                          [ch]E[/ch]
Cause I don't know who you are[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                         [ch]C[/ch]
I wonder if it's even possible for you to escape this[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Keep on asking about you[/tab]

They don't know what to tell me
[tab]                        [ch]E[/ch]
They don't know who you are[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
They don't know who you are[/tab]

[Verse 2:]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I was listening through the wall when you met your monsters[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                      [ch]C[/ch]
Heard'em break the closet door and take you away[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]E[/ch]
Hoping you would change like the color of the moonlight[/tab]
Bouncing off the rain
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I, I heard the devil in you that day[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]C[/ch]
Watch the world around you cascade[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]E[/ch]
Laughing like you would have fed your family to the serpent[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Family to the serpent[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
You got something that the world won't talk about[/tab]
They walk around it
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
It's deep sleep, crawling in the street[/tab]
Pushing the bayonet into me
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
You got something that the world keeps trapped inside[/tab]
You aconite
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]
Cause I watched you turn around[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]E[/ch]
Go and try to feed you family to the serpent[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
Family to the serpent whole[/tab]

[Bridge:]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
These words won't break on you I know[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
I've done my best to help so many times before[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
These words won't break on you I know[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch] 
I've done my best to help[/tab]

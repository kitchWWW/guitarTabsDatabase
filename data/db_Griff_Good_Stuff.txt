[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  Take it back to the start[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  No, I can't tell you apart[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
When we lost one another[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
That's when I rediscover[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  My memories in the clouds[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  But no feet on the ground[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
'Cause I know I should forget you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
Why can't I just regret you?[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                                      [ch]Em[/ch]
We were fighting fires every night when you met me[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And it's not fair at all, so after everything[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Why'd you leave me with the good stuff, babe[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
And forget about the mess we made?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                                            [ch]C[/ch]
Oh, I wish that my mouth didn't smile when I think of you[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
But you left me with the good stuff, babe[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
And I know that it's a crying shame[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
It's a million times harder when I don't hate you[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  Oh, I try to rewind[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  Every scene in my mind[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
And for you, I've got tunnel vision[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
And I've blocked out every collision[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  And in another life, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  Do me a favour and try[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
To leave me broken and bitter[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
So moving on's a little quicker[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                                      [ch]Em[/ch]
We were fighting fires every night when you met me[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And it's not fair at all, so after everything[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Why'd you leave me with the good stuff, babe[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
And forget about the mess we made?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                                            [ch]C[/ch]
Oh, I wish that my mouth didn't smile when I think of you[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
But you left me with the good stuff, babe[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
And I know that it's a crying shame[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
It's a million times harder when I don't hate you[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
Let me ask you why[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
I wonder if you're going through the same as I tonight[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Why'd you leave me with the good stuff, babe[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
And forget about the mess we made?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                                            [ch]C[/ch]
Oh, I wish that my mouth didn't smile when I think of you[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Why'd you leave me with the good stuff, babe[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
And forget about the mess we made?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                                            [ch]C[/ch]
Oh, I wish that my mouth didn't smile when I think of you[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
But you left me with the good stuff, babe[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
And I know that it's a crying shame[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
It's a million times harder when I don't hate you[/tab]

When I don't hate you

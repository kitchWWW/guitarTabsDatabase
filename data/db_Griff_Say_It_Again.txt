[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]AM[/ch]
You don't say how you feel when you're sober, baby[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]F[/ch]
But when we're out and it's getting late[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]AM[/ch]
You tell me 'bout the troubles that haunt you lately[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
And the only thing that I can ever say[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
Is come closer, come closer[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
Oh, let me hold you now[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]AM[/ch]
I know that I'm no saviour, no[/tab]

Yeah, I know that even if I was the wisest of them all[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
It don't matter, not at all[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
If you don't believe it so[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]AM[/ch]
How ever many times that you need to, baby[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
Just tell yourself it's gon' be okay[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]AM[/ch]
How ever many times that you need to hear it[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]AM[/ch]
It's gon' be fine[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]DM[/ch]
Say it until the devil's gone[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Pray it until the devil runs[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]

Chords: Gun-Shy by Grizzly Bear

I can't believe no one has done tabs for this song yet. Although the guitar is barely
heard in the song in comparison to the strong vocals and synths, it is still there and the
melody is as well.

The song song sounds like it has been tuned down or up a half step not sure which, but
I'm way too lazy to find out.

Play a single note while holding the chord and then strum the whole chord, palm mute,
and then progress to the next chord. You can also get a synth like effect if you use a
delay pedal and do volume swells (strumming with vol off on guitar and then increasing 
the volume after you strum).

Played the barred version of these chords....

[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]      [ch]F#m[/ch]         [ch]F#m[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]
The sky keeps staring at me[/tab]

[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
Frozen in my tracks[/tab]
(Nothing else to see)

[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]      [ch]F#m[/ch]         [ch]F#m[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]
And when I move my face left[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
You're always standing there[/tab]
(A shadow I can't see)

(AND THE CHORDS CONTINUE ON LINE THAT TILL THE CHORUS)

And even then I can't trace
Your walking away

I put my ears to the ground
Always pushing down
(Nothing I can hear)
I found the worst half in me
I'm cut off at the knees
(Can't even take a stand)
Against your words and beliefs
I didn't wanna freeze

********CHORUS********************

(All of the years, leaving me here
Gun-shy)
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]        [ch]G#m[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
I don't wanna say it all again[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]
Everything you see[/tab]

********CHORUS CHORDS GO ON LIKE THAT*************

(Why) Do I always feel it all the same
This is in my eye
A guide that has only led me astray
And even as I live (you smile)

The cold keeps tearing at me
Slowing down my blood
(Unable to speak)
I left my mind long ago
Choosing something false
(Always letting go)
And when I try to face you
You're walking away

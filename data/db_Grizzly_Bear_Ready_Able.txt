Artist: Grizzly Bear
Song: Ready Able
Genre: 
Key: 


        You'll have to listen to the song while you're practicing to fully understand how to 
play it. THE VERSE IS PLAYED IN 4/4 TIMING where as THE BRIDGE AND CHORUS ARE PLAYED IN 
3/4 TIMING, so you need a good enough understanding of music theory to play the song.

C (palm mute and pluck throughout the verse at a steady pace)
I'm gonna take a stab at this
sure you will be alright
make a decision with a kiss
baby I have false spite

(The bridge is pretty straight forward, just remember that it is in 3/4 timing!)
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
And when I trek alone back home[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
I make sure I trek in the snow[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Would I fall?[/tab]

C (same as verse before)
Tissue and bones, it was a trick
this isn't a gun-fight
checking it off of my list
unable to rewrite

(Bridge, same as before)

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
Five years cast once and far alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
hope I'm ready, able to make my own[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Goodbye[/tab]

[tab](For this part, the chorus, you play the [ch]Dm[/ch] for 2 bars, as well as the [ch]Am[/ch] and [ch]G[/ch]. This 
part is also in 3/4 timing.)[/tab]
Repeat 4 times

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
They go, we go[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I want you to know[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
what I did, I did[/tab]

(For this next part play the [ch]Dm[/ch] for 4 bars, and the [ch]Am[/ch] and [ch]G[/ch] for 2).

[ch]Am[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch], [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch]

(repeat chorus twice, the second time you play Dm for 4 bars).

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
They go, we go[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I want you to know[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
what I did, I did[/tab]

After the last chorus is a play off using the chords from the chorus (in that same order).

I prefer to end on a Dm because it sounds jazzy, and it fits nicely, but go ahead and 
end on [ch]Am[/ch] if you like.

C
Betty's a bombshell, she just got paid
G                      F
Crossing the street on passionate gates
C
Billy's a looker he's from upstate
G                        F
He ran into Betty and he took her on a date
          C                               G          F     
And its a sunny day, we will go away, on a holiday
          C                               G          F     
And its a sunny day, we will go away, on a holiday

       C              Am                       F
And its okay, all the suffering obliterates our speed
              C                         Am
But don't you wait (don't you wait) the faster you let
             F                G
go  you will receive what you need


C G F x2

    C          
And Betty said Billy why you making that face
G                              F
Since you moved in you've been on a different page
C
You've been out of commission hiding in the kitchen
G                        F
Freddy came over and you couldn't even listen
     C                       G                  F     
Its a great escape from your heartache its your replay
     C                       G                  F     
Its a great escape from your heartache its your replay

       C              Am                       F
And its okay, all the suffering obliterates our speed
              C                         Am
But don't you wait (don't you wait) the faster you let
             F                G
go  you will receive what you need


       C              Am                       F
And its okay, all the suffering obliterates our speed
              C                         Am
But don't you wait (don't you wait) the faster you let
             F                G
go  you will receive what you need

C   G   F
            Uh uh uh
C   G   F


   C                               G          F                     
It's a sunny day, we will go away, on a holiday
C                                   G          F
It's a sunny day, we will get away, on a holiday
C                  G       F   
It's a... uh uh uh... holiday
C        G        F
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay. 
C     G    F       G
holidaaaaaaay

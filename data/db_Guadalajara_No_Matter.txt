Guadalajara - No Matter

Standard Tuning, No Capo

[Verse 1]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
No matter how many shows you've played[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
Or if these songs are even selfmade[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
Dress up for the masquerade[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Straight to the top of the hitparade[/tab]

Been at the birthday parties, weddings
[tab]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
And the funerals of the present clones[/tab]

On the music playground
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
The press creates a hype and after all[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
The fame brings people all around you[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Hugs and handshakes[/tab]

From your new friends
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
And your view is[/tab]

Through a distorted lens
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
Here comes a new trend[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
And one very last goodbye[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Is this what you wanted[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
Is this what you've been expecting[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
Shallow friendships with the people you adored[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Is this what you wanted[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
Is this what you've been expecting[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
You always used to say you wanted more[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Now you're playing local radio's barbecue[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
Kind of the shows that no-one ever wants to do[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Midnight streets are empty as the concert hall[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And you are waiting for a recall[/tab]

A chain reaction of circumstance
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Hoping for another bunch of second chances[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
A melting pot of misunderstandings[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
Of overrated attitudes and fake romances[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Hugs and handshakes[/tab]

From your new friends
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
And your view is[/tab]

Through a distorted lens
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
Here comes a new trend[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
And one very last goodbye[/tab]

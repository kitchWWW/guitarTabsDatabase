[Intro]
[ch]A[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Don't you realize[/tab]
blessing from the skies
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Don't come that easy[/tab]
why do you leave me?
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I know I'm the one[/tab]
why you say you're done
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Less is enough[/tab]
I got so much

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
You won't see me cry[/tab]
But I'm not gonna lie
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
I've got these feelings[/tab]
in my heart beating
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I might be a fool[/tab]
if I lose my cool
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
But it's so much more[/tab]
than a fast run

[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
'Cause I've been thinkin' about,[/tab]
thinkin' about you
[tab]                [ch]F#m[/ch]
Yeah, I've been thinkin'[/tab]
about the past and us two
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
And I don't want you living in,[/tab]
living in regret
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]
When I know that I'm the best[/tab]
that you'll ever get
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
'Cause I've been thinkin' about,[/tab]
thinkin' about you
[tab]                [ch]F#m[/ch]
Yeah, I've been thinkin'[/tab]
we're meant to last us two
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
And I don't want you living in,[/tab]
living in regret
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
When I am the one[/tab]
you will never forget

[Verse]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Does she know you call[/tab]
when you have withdrawals
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
I know you're obsessed[/tab]
i'm messing with your head
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
She can not compete[/tab]
you should be with me
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Our love is more than a short crush[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
Remember the day[/tab]
when you walked out the door
[tab]           [ch]F#m[/ch]
Left me in pieces[/tab]
'cause I wanted more
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
It's like my head and[/tab]
my heart are at war
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Nothing makes sense now,[/tab]
so come make me whole

[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
'Cause I've been thinkin' about,[/tab]
thinkin' about you
[tab]                [ch]F#m[/ch]
Yeah, I've been thinkin'[/tab]
about the past and us two
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
And I don't want you living in,[/tab]
living in regret

When I know that I'm the best[/tab]
that you'll ever get

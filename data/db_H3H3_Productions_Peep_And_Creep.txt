By H3H3 Productions (standard tuning)

[Intro]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]              
Peep and creep, peep and creep, changing the game for creeps like me, nobody can tell just what I can see[/tab]


[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
Peep and creep, peep the cuties at the beach, you might think I’m asleep, but I’m looking at your teets[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
I’ll be watching you and your mother too, society can’t judge me for what my eyes do[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I’m locked onto those jugs, and I’m peeping hard, and I'm getting hard but you think it’s just VR,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Or talking with my mom, or I’m looking at a tree but most definitely not checking out your booty, except[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
I am, and I’m not ashamed, because the peep and creep has changed the game, peep and creep has changed the[/tab]
game.
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]C7[/ch]
I’m peeping creeping it will set you free, to look at mammaries and too look at booties[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
It’s good for you and it’s good for me, I’m sorry but I’ve been this way since puberty, YEAH[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]C7[/ch]
Peep and creep peep the cuties at the beach, you might think I’m asleep but I’m just peeping at your cheeks,[/tab]
WHOA
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Peep and creep will set you free or maybe I’m just peeping at two titties[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
I’ll be watching you or maybe your mom and friend too, society can’t judge me for what my eyes do [/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
I’ll be watching you or maybe your mom and friend too, society can’t judge me for what my eyes do [/tab]

[Outro]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
Peep and creep, peep and creep, changing the game for creeps like me, nobody can tell just what I can see [/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Peep and creep, peep and creep, changing the game for creeps like me, nobody can tell just what I can see[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
I often dream of you showing up late with your eyes wide open [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
No one stares in the dark of the room, and the walls don't listen [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
I always thought you'd look like the real thing, in the light wide open [/tab]


[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]     
And your eyes are leading me on, but i can't see right through you. [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
the Big One seems to be right on time, and the night moves over us. [/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
I often dream of you showing up late, when the night's wide open [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
My hands slide over the back of your jeans, while the walls they tremble [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
I wonder if you'll still be around, when the ground is wide open [/tab]


[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
And your eyes are leading me on, but i can't see through you. [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch] 
the Big One seems to be coming up fast, and the night moves over us. [/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
Have you got something to say before i turn the lights on?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch] 
Now the Big One is coming up fast, how do we make it through this? [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
Have you got something to say before i turn the lights on? [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
the Big One seems to be right on time, and the night moves over us.[/tab]

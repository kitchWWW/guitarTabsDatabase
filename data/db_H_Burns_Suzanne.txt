[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]                            [ch]Dm[/ch]
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night beside her[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
And you know that she's half-crazy but that's why you want to be there[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]F[/ch]
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
Then she gets you on her wavelength and she lets the river answer[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
That you've always been her lover[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]F[/ch]
And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
And then you know that she will trust you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Dm[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]                                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]
He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]Dm[/ch]
But he, himself was broken, long before the sky would open[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Dm[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]F[/ch]
And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
And you think maybe you'll trust him[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
Now, Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]                                [ch]Dm[/ch]
She's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]Dm[/ch]
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
While Suzanne holds the mirror[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]F[/ch]
And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
And you think maybe you'll trust him[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind[/tab]

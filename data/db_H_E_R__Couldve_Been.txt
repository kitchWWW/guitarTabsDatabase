[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D#m11[/ch]     [ch]D9b5[/ch]  [ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]
                        Somebody give me, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#m11[/ch]
     Somebody give me, uh[/tab]
[tab][ch]D9b5[/ch]                      [ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]
     Somebody tell me the answers Me and you isn't the answer, uh Me and you isn't[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#m11[/ch]                  [ch]D9b5[/ch]
     Maybe I'm tellin' myself that[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]
But there ain't nothin' that'll change that What good would it be, if I knew how you[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#m11[/ch]
felt about me? (yeah)[/tab]
[tab][ch]D9b5[/ch]                             [ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]
It could've been right but I was wrong[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                              [ch]AM9[/ch]
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]F#m11[/ch]
The part of me that cared is almost gone[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D/E[/ch]
And I know, that I can't, get caught up[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D#m11[/ch]
We could've been[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D9b5[/ch]
And we try to pretend[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]
Every now and again, We don't dream about, don't think about what[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#m11[/ch]
We could've been[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D9b5[/ch]
Though I'm holding it in[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]
'Cause I know in the end You dream about, I think about what[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#m11[/ch]
    We could've been[/tab]
[tab][ch]D9b5[/ch]
    We could've been, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]
    We could've, damn[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D#m11[/ch]
     Remember?[/tab]
[tab][ch]D9b5[/ch]                       [ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]
     Remember the night in Miami First time you put your arms around me[/tab]
I'm up reminiscin'
[tab][ch]D#m11[/ch]
(ooh yeah)                    D9b5[/tab]
     Thinking 'bout you isn't helping
[tab]                           [ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]
Thinking 'bout you doesn't tell me What good it would do, if I decide to[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#m11[/ch]
face the truth[/tab]
[tab][ch]D9b5[/ch]
It could've been right[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]
but I was wrong,[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                              [ch]AM9[/ch]
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]F#m11[/ch]
You only hit me up when she's not home[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D/E[/ch]
And that's why, I can't, get caught up[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D#m11[/ch]
We could've been[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D9b5[/ch]
And we try to pretend[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]
Every now and again, We don't dream about, don't think about what[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#m11[/ch]
We could've been[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D9b5[/ch]
Though I'm holding it in[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]
'Cause I know in the end You dream about, I think about what[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#m11[/ch]
    We could've been[/tab]
[tab][ch]D9b5[/ch]
    We could've been,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]
    We could've,[/tab]

[tab]                                  [ch]F#m11[/ch]   [ch]D/E[/ch]
What we could've been, we could've been[/tab]

[tab][ch]D#m11[/ch]     [ch]D9b5[/ch]               [ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]

[tab]      [ch]D#m11[/ch]                                             [ch]D9b5[/ch]
With somebody, if you gotta hide it what's the point of trying?[/tab]
[tab]                                                  [ch]G#m7/C#[/ch]

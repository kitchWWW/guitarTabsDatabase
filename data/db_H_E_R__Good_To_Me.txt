[Outro]
N.C.
Do we have enough?

Uh, what did I say?

I'ma just write down shit and then...

I know for a fact you said "warmth" and "unconditional love"

Alright, okay, so what if...

In the beginning, I'm saying...

In my eyes, you're a combination of

The kindness and compassion of my mother

And the warmth and—what did I say?

Warmth and unconditional love of my father

And when we're together, this and that, and I feel this

And the way that you treat me is this

And I feel, I feel, I, it takes me back to this

And, and that feeling is good, but are you really good to me?

And then it's...

Who are you when I'm not around? Is it the same?

That's fire

Are you... basically, like if we could say it in a cool way

Like, do you act like you're single when it's not us two?

You know? Like that kind of thing, you know what I'm saying?

Like, really kind of dig in and make this story, like, set up in a way that's like "oh shit"

Do I get that? I'm recording, right? Do I...

Is it, is it deceit? You know? Or is it, is it real? But only when...

Is it real... is it real around me and to the world you, you fake something?

You know?

Right

And... 'cause some people... some people aren't really...

Some people aren't really, um, bad people

But they feel like they have to be, you know?

Right

To get even deeper into it

Like, I think some men were raised a certain way

But they get around other kind of men and get insecure

And feel like they have to be that way

You know what I'm saying?

Like, they have to be that way or they feel like

"Okay, this is how I'm gonna...

This is the way it's supposed to be because my boys told me that"

You know?

So I think it's kind of like the other perspective of not, like

Coming from a woman who's with a man that's no good

But it's a man that is good to me

But you have be good to me when I'm not around

And you have to think of who you really want to be

Right

Ah, la, la, la, you got to be good to me

Yeah, anyway

Had to dig into it real quick

What did I say?

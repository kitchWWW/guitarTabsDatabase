[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
When I got up out of bed, this morning[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I didn't know you yet[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
And I still don't know you now,[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]A7[/ch]
But at least I know I want to[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
If we never meet again[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Press all the buttons to extend[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
The time we spent together here[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A7[/ch]
In constant undulation[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
Distracted we ascend[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
And an unfamilar hit[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
Heart to heart but in our ears[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A7[/ch]
In muted celebration[/tab]

[Pre-chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Two steps, ten floors[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Two steps, ten floors[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Bumped into a stranger in an elevator[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Goin' up, goin' up, goin' up together[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Bumped into a stranger in an elevator[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Goin' up, goin' up![/tab]

[Verse]

When I got up out of bed, this morning[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I didn't know you yet[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
And I still don't know you now,[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A7[/ch]
But at least I know I want to[/tab]

[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
We're dangling by a thread[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
We intertwine and disconnect[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Em[/ch]
And when our ride comes to an end[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A7[/ch]
Just remember that I loved you[/tab]


[Pre-chorus]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
And all we wanted was to know (all we ever wanted was to know)[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
All we wanted to know[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
That we were alive at the same time[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]A[/ch]
That we were alive at the same time[/tab]

That we were alive at the same time[/tab]

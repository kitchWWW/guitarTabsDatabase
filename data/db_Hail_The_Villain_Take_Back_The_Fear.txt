Artist: Hail The Villain
Song: Take Back The Fear
Genre:

So this song is seriously detuned and a pain if you're playing a set so I found a
good way to play acoustic that sounds good. Hope you like it!

What I believe is all that I am[/tab]
Take it away, I’m only a man
Back from the dead and now it appears
I’ll be the one to take back the fear

(Main Riff)

Kill or be killed, that isn’t me
Maybe it’s you dying to be
Somebody else. Man of the year
But I am the one to take back the fear

(Main Riff)

Don’t want anything taken away[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
Taken away from me[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch] (first time)
It’s all that I believe[/tab]

Message of hate, fading away[/tab]
My love and my failures “one in the same”
Now that I’m back, painfully clear
But I’ll be the one to take back the fear

(Chorus)


[tab][ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]B[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
When it seems that everything was all a dream[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
Everything’s not what it seems[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
Even I cannot believe in me easily[/tab]

(Breakdown)

Play around with G, riff it out a little. Original has a G ring over harmonics.

Hope this is fun for someone. Let me know what you think, I'll be posting a few 
more acoustic tabs soon.

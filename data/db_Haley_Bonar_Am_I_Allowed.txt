[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Just let me see you, I sure miss your smile,[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
But they ain't your dreams.[/tab]

(start strumming chords)
So when you come home dear, Swear to God I'll love you,
I was much too young then, This time I'll be true,
We'll buy a big house, With a great big willow,
We'll sit upon the green lawn, Watch our flowers grow,
When you come home dear.

And this town is dying, All the stores are closing,
Whole town drinks whiskey, startin' early morning,
Everything is changing, Everyone is changing,
I've been thinking 'bout leaving, But I must stop thinking,
Because I lost myself.

We'll stay up all night, Just telling stories,
Like we did before, dear, Any of this happened,
They'll hear us laughing, And everywhere that we go,
They'll see us smiling, And holding hands, too,
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
Guess I still love you, I want the world to know,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
That I still love you, I want the world to know,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
That I still love you, I want the world to know,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
That I still love you, That I still love you.[/tab]

So am I allowed, To step in your shoes,
I know you've been sad, Everyone's been blue,
Just let me see you, I sure miss your smile,
We've both been lonely, We can kiss for a while,
Just let me see you, I want the world to know,
That I still love you, I want the world to know,
That I still love you, I want the world to know,
That I still love you, That I still love you.

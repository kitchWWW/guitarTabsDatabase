This tab is for C.G.

I first saw Haley Bonar when she opened for Andrew Bird at the Chicago Opera House in
2009. This song was my favorite, mostly because its such a raw, exposed song that's all
her lovely pipes. The hardest part about this was transcribing the lyrics, the chords
simple, and taken from a video, so I'm 100% that this is how she plays it.

In the video I watched she has capo on 1st fret, but in her Daywalker Session recording, 
is played without. Also in the Daywalker session she arpeggiated all the chords, 
she just strummed the chords in the video.

Last notes: The last verse and last chorus were not in the Daywalker Session either. 
I promise I didn't make them up. They were in the video I tabbed from.

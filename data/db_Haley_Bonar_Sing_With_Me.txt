[Chords continue same as above!]

you don't have friends, and you don't have love
but if you sing to them, they will be your friends
cause it means you love them and they can tell
when you sing so loud and you sing so well

you don't even have to play guitar
you can sing in the back seat of your momma's car
you can sing to your fish or your dog or your cat
you can ask them to join them in the chorus that goes

sing with me, why don't you sing with me, why don't you sing with me
sing with me, why don't you sing with me, why don't you sing with me
sing with me, why don't you sing with me, why don't you sing with me
sing with me, why don't you sing with me, why don't you sing with me

you don't have to know what you're singing about
don't need to whisper you don't need to shout
open your mind open up your voice
pick a syllable and a voyel of choice

la la la la la la la la la la la la
do do do do do do do do do do do-do
mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi
so so so so so so so so so so so what?

sing with me, why don't you sing with me, why don't you sing with me
sing with me, why don't you sing with me, why don't you sing with me
sing with me, why don't you sing with me, why don't you sing with me
sing with me, why don't you sing with me, why don't you sing with me

 One night a man had a dream. He dreamed he was walking along the beach with the Lord. Across [/tab]
[tab]                                          [ch]A[/ch]
the sky flashed scenes from his life. For each scene, he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand.[/tab]

him, he looked back at the footprints in the sand, and he noticed that many times along the path[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]A[/ch]
of his life there was only one set of footprints. He also noticed that it happened at the very[/tab]

lowest and saddest times of his life. This really bothered him and he questioned the Lord about[/tab]

 The teenager awoke at mid-day. He walked into the back garden. Everything was peaceful[/tab]

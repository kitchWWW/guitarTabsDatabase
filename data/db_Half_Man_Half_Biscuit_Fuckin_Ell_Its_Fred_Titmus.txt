Oh I was walking round my favourite store[/tab]
[tab][ch]D7[/ch]                                [ch]G7[/ch]
Searching for the ten pence off Lenor[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D7[/ch]                          [ch]G7[/ch]
When suddenly I bumped into this guy[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D7[/ch]                         [ch]G7[/ch]
On seeing who it was I gave a cry:[/tab]

“Fuckin’ ‘Ell, it’s Fred Titmus!”

[tab]   [ch]D7[/ch]                              [ch]G7[/ch]
Oh Jane was pushing baby round the park[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D7[/ch]                              [ch]G7[/ch]
When all at once she saw her husband Mark[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D7[/ch]                            [ch]G7[/ch]
Well he was with a man down by the stream[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D7[/ch]                          [ch]G7[/ch]
So Jane and baby both began to scream:[/tab]
(nc)
“Fuckin’ ‘Ell, it’s Fred Titmus!”

Oh as the train pulled into platform three[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D7[/ch]                                [ch]G7[/ch]
I looked around for my best girl to see[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D7[/ch]                               [ch]G7[/ch]
As she disembarked but I didn’t seem to care[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D7[/ch]                                   [ch]G7[/ch]
‘Cos someone passed that made me stop and stare.[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]D7[/ch]
Oh Dracula comes from Transylvania[/tab]

Stevie nicks books about kleptomania

Johnny looked out of his bedroom window
[tab]                                           [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] (X4)
And shouted to his mum “Fred Titmus”.   [/tab]

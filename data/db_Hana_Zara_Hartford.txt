[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Hartford I saw you, gutted and empty[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
saw you lucid and blue, pecking for food[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
and how I loved you, I brought you flowers[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
For the gaps in your streets, strewn your sidewalk with seeds[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I saw you were thirsty so I brought you rainstorms[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
for the lines in the woodwork, the moss on the floor[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
and then Hartford I gave you, up like a present[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
to the pigeons and gulls, the ravens and wolves[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
oh Americana mystic, American dream[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
with your cinematic moonlight, and your blue kerosene[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
carousel parts in the scrapyard and the gaps in your teeth[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
you daughter of nobody[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Hartford I saw you, there from the freeway,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Under billboards and lights, and fast food signs[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I heard you calling through the hum of the highway,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Heard your shiver and groan, your howl and moan[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Oh Americana mama of the sinew and soot,[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
with a baby at your bosom and a fire under foot[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
With your organic indifference and your infinite love,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Americana mama of all of us[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Hartford I saw you, wrapped in a blanket[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
made of feathers and leaves, and river reeds[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Stood in the sunshine, you little monster,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
with the train of your spine and your broken window eyes you cried[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Americana classic, would you please let me go[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
I am kudzu and ivy, I am crumbling stone[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
I am skinnier than ever and Iâ€™m shivering cold[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]D[/ch]
With my streets paved with flyers, buying silver and gold,[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
Oh Americana mystic, oh you medicine man,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
With the leather of your bare feet and a gun in your hand,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
lead the army of the new world, where Amanda is king,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
and plants flowers in everything[/tab]

[ch]D[/ch]-[ch]A[/ch]-[ch]Em[/ch]-[ch]G[/ch]

[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
I've been running around[/tab]
         
Like an unkempt kid
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Tryin' to remember[/tab]

The things I did
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
If I went too far[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
I hope it doesn't do me in.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
'cause they tell me a man[/tab]

Is just the sum of his parts
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
Well I'm body, and blood, and a terrible heart[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
And it all adds up[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]
To every different person I've been.[/tab]



[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
I wanted to crash your party[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]
But I couldn't find your house.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]
I wanted to touch your body[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
And kiss you on the mouth.[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
Bloodshot[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]
What do you want?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
What do you want?[/tab]



[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
And I know that you see me[/tab]
 
As a younger man
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
But cities and countries, they had other plans[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]
And we all grow up[/tab]
[tab]                                          [ch]G[/ch]
What do you think, you're gonna grow back?[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
They people around me[/tab]

They're not my friends
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
You can do what you want[/tab]

I'd rather pretend
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
'cause no one should be lonely[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]G[/ch]
Everyone needs people like that[/tab]


[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
I wanted to crash your party[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]
But I couldn't find your house.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]
I wanted to touch your body[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
And kiss you on the mouth.[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
Bloodshot[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]
What do you want?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
What do you want?[/tab]



[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Everyone you know[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
Is living at home in the gutted out basement[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And chemicals oh...[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
Bloodshot[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]
What do you want?[/tab]

What do you want?[/tab]

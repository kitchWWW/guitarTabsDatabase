Artist: Hank Green
Song: Helen Hunt

Here is yet another Hank Green, the musical half of the "vlogbrothers", 
song. This song is about Hanks first movie star fantasy crush at the age of 
14 and had decided to write his love down in a song. This was off of his 
first album "So Jokes". If you any problem with the tab, just listen to the 
song and it should hopefully make some sense. And, when you've made your 
final judgement, please rate and comment.

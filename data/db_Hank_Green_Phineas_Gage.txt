Oh, Phineas Gage was 25 years old in 1848.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
And he liked his job, working at the railroad, but he had another fate.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                           [ch]F[/ch]
He was blasting rock when something distracted him.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]
And he forgot to put the tamping sand in.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
He shoved the tamping rod into that little hole onto the blasting powder.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
And suddenly his entire left frontal lobe had been turned into clam chowder.[/tab]


[tab][ch]C[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
Oh this is the story of Phineas Gage, who was stabbed in the brain.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
And once your frontal lobe has been destroyed, you can never go home again.[/tab]

And so on. DFTBA

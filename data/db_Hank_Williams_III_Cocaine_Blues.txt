[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        
I went right home and I went to bed[/tab]
G   C   NC                          NC
I stuck that lovin' .44 beneath my head

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Made a good run but I run too slow[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]   NC
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico[/tab]

[Verse 3]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Laid in the hot joints takin' the pills[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He said Willie Lee your name is not Jack Brown[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]    NC
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Said yes, oh yes my name is Willie Lee [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch] 
If you've got a warrant just read it to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Shot her down because she made me slow[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]               NC
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more[/tab]

[Verse 5]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
When I was arrested I was dressed in black[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
They put me on a train and they took me back[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Had no friend for to go my bail [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]         NC
They slapped my dottered carcass in that county jail[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Early next mornin' bout a half past nine [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
I spied the sheriff coming down the line[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  
He kind of coughed as he cleared his throat[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]                 NC
He said, "Come on you dirty hack to the district court"[/tab]

[Verse 7]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Into the courtroom my trial began [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Where I was held by twelve honest men[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Just before the jury started out [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]       NC
I saw that dirty judge commence to look about[/tab]

[Verse 8]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
In about five minutes in walked a man [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Holding the verdict in his right hand[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch] 
The verdict read in the first degree [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]         NC
I hollered, "Lawdy Lawdy, have mercy on me"[/tab]

[Verse 9]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
99 years in the Folsom state pen[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
99 years underneath that ground [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]       NC
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down[/tab]

[Refrain]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Come on you've gotta listen unto me [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                         [ch]C[/ch]
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]B[/ch]                       [ch]F#[/ch]
Everybody says you'll let me down[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]B[/ch]
That I should be ashamed to take you out[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]E[/ch]
Makes no difference what you used to do[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]
Darlin' I Could Never Be Ashamed of You.[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]B[/ch]
Maybe you were reckless yesterday[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C#[/ch]                              [ch]F#[/ch]
But together, we can find a brighter way[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]                              [ch]F#[/ch]
In my heart, I know that you'll come through[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]B[/ch]
Darlin' I Could Never Be Ashamed of You.[/tab]

[tab]                            [ch]F#[/ch]
All the happiness I've ever known[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]B[/ch]
Came the day you said you'd be my own[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]E[/ch]
And it matters not what we go through[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]
Darlin' I Could Never Be Ashamed of You.[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]
Maybe you've been cheated in the past[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C#[/ch]                              [ch]F#[/ch]
And perhaps those memories will always last[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]F#[/ch]
Even though you proved to be untrue[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]B[/ch]
Darlin' I Could Never Be Ashamed of You.[/tab]

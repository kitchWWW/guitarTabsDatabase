[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Last night I dreamed of your love[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
You came home to me[/tab]
Never more you wrong out
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
And I was so happy[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
And then I cried[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
When I woke and found you gone[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
Lord take my pain[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
My Hearts Been Broke Too Long.[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Each time I think about you[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
I can catch all my tears[/tab]
You used to be my baby
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
But you quit lovin' me dear[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
And now each time[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I stay awake till dawn[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
Lord take my pain[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
My Hearts Been Broke Too Long.[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I hope you're always happy[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
And that your soul stays free[/tab]
If you ever need a pal
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
You can always count on me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
So until then[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
It's time to travel on[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
Lord take my pain[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
My Hearts Been Broke Too Long.[/tab]

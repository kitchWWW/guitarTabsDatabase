I want my money back, give it back to me.
I want my loving back, don't want your empathy.

The road to my heart is narrow and covered with thorn.
Vultures circling 'round the sky are hungry and the snakes are coiled.

Don't walk away, don't walk alone.
Don't walk away, the streets are cold.

Heard me say,
My head is in the dirt.
My mind is in the sea.
My blood is on the money ground.
Hold my hand and walk away with me.

The more that I do wrong, the more that my love grows deep.
So I drink myself to sleep at night and dream about her misery.

Don't walk away, don't walk alone.
Don't walk away, the streets are cold.

Don't walk away, don't walk alone.
Don't walk away, the streets are cold.

Don't walk away, don't walk alone.
Don't walk away, too far from home.

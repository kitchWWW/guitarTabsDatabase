[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]
V1      I don't know where you came from[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
        even though sometimes we won't get along[/tab]

        there's not a day that passes by, my dear

        that I don't think of the first night we spoke

        and those words are staying upon your skin

        along with that precious smile of hope

[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
CH              that's why I'm like wait, wait, wait[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
                don't you know I could be your home?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
                I'm like wait, wait, wait[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
                cause nobody wants to be alone[/tab]

V2      lying there on the kitchen floor                (same as V1)

        were the last signs of a helpless soul

        and she knew that he would die right then

        and so she held him until the last breath grew old

        and so she cried as her darling slept

        in between her arms, slid to the floor

        and then she screamed out into the cold, cold night

        oh my God, please don't go

CH              she was like, wait, wait, wait

                I love you more than you know

                she was like, wait, wait, wait

                I don't wanna be alone

                oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (ahem)

                that's why I'm like, wait, wait, wait

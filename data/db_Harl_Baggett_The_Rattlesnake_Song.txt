[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
I get ten bucks a skin and I'm eatin' all the meat[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
I got a totesack full of rattlers and a totebox all for me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
I catch em' with a forked stick and I catch em' with my hand[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
Well the biggest snake I ever caught I never will forget[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
I flushed him out with dynamite and caught him with a net[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
Well he cut the net with his fangs, stuck out his horry head[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
Then he bit my Uncle on the leg and killed him flat out dead[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
I catch em' with a forked stick and I catch em' with my hand[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
That's how I make my livin' I'm the rattlin' hunting man[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
My brother had a ten gauge gun he bought on Groundhog Day[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
I snathced that thing out his head and shot all the shells away[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]Am[/ch]
That snake fought the dogs for half the day, killed every one[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
Then the doctor came and run him down with a tranquilizer gun[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
I get ten bucks a skin and I'm eatin' all the meat[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
I catch em' with a forked stick and I catch em' with my hand[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]

[Verse 3]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
He was as big around as a stove pipe and half a boxcar long[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
It took four men half a day just to drag that old snake home[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
I kept him in a chicken pen and fed him crows and rats[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]
Then I sold him to a sideshow man for a hundred dollars flat[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]

Artist: Harley Poe
Song: Corpse Grinding Man
Genre: 
Key: 


Couldn't find any solid versions of this that was complete on
here so I decided to work this out myself, note that I used the
"The Dead and the Naked" version of this as my template, though
the only differences in other versions are certain lines popping
up later in the song rather than earlier and using this you
should have no problem working out those versions as well.  Great,
fun song to play along with.  Feel free to post any corrections
and I'll do what I can to keep this accurate if I've made any
errors, enjoy.

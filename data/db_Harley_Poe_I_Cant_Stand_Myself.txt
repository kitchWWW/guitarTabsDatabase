[ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I see you in my dreams[/tab]

You love me so obscene
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]
But you're way too good for me[/tab]

That's why we couldn't be
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Life can be so cruel[/tab]

I'm just another fool
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
For thinking I could keep a love that once was deep[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
But now you're with that guy[/tab]

The douche bag and his son
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
The feeling you can fly and you're having so much fun[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
The way you used to feel was it ever real[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
When you split your family[/tab]

Your actions helped me see
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
That I can't stand myself[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm sorry I put you on a shelf[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
I can't stand you with anyone else[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
I can't stand myself[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
I don't mean to throw a stone[/tab]

But can you be alone
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]
And I will make a bet[/tab]

Your always someone's pet
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
You think that you're so strong[/tab]

I wouldn't say you're wrong
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
But emotions run your life[/tab]

Until your someone's wife
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
Sweetheart don't you know I'd never let you go[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]
I know that you don't care you make an ugly pair[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
With that dough boy that pretends[/tab]

And all your happy friends
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
You'll enjoy the place you're at till[/tab]

You're unhappy once again
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
And I can't stand myself[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm sorry I put you on a shelf[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
I can't stand you with anyone else[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
I can't stand myself[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
I just can't stand myself[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I can't stand myself[/tab]


[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
See I couldn't see[/tab]

What was wrong with me
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
We saw things differently[/tab]

The way it had to be
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
I made you feel so small[/tab]

So I could have it all
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
The hurt it crushed your heart[/tab]

And tore our love apart
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
But did you really think that I would never change[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I just had to sink and start to rearrange[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
If you’d only take me back[/tab]

And give me one more dance
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Our love would never lack[/tab]

But you're not taking the chance
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I can't stand myself[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm sorry I put you on a shelf[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
I can't stand you with anyone else[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
I can't stand myself[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
I can't stand myself[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm sorry I put you on a shelf[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
I can't stand you with anyone else[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
I can't stand myself[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
I just can't stand myself[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
And I can't stand myself[/tab]

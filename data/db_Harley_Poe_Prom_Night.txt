[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
She was a hotty, but she didn't feel the same way about me[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
She was a diamond, so shiny, but I just couldn't get her to see[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
I was for her, she was for me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And together we could be[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
White picket fence and little dog[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]G#[/ch]
Someday a family[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
Prom night was just around the corner, yes it was[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]G#[/ch]
But I was afraid to ask her all because[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
She wouldn't go out with me[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
She wanted Johnny, Johnny[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
She wouldn't ever be with me[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
She wanted Johnny, Johnny[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
He was so cool in my school[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
And I was just a fool[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
That's okay 'cause on prom night[/tab]

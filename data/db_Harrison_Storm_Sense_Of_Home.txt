[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
For these words he won't come around here[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
And his eyes won't see[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
And you know he won't come around here[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
He needs it to be[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
It's like something evil is taking a hold, nothing deep here[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
It's like we're losing our sense of home[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
Just disappear[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
Just disappear[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Tell your mother you're leaving here[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Tell your brother you're going away[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Tell your mother she needs to reassess herself[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]
And this will be the only way[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]
Sometimes he tries to reassure himself[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
That it's all still there[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
But most times he just cries to himself[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]
Sunk deep into his chair[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
Tell your brother you're listening to his dreams[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
Tell your sister she is all you need[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
Tell your mother she is the only one, and your father has made you all that you've become[/tab]
[tab]                                                 [ch]C[/ch]
'Cause these words aren't meant for anyone else, but your family[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
Tell your brother you're listening to his dreams[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
Tell your sister she is all you need[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
Tell your mother she is the only one, and your father has made you all that you've become[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                           [ch]C[/ch]
And your father has made you all that you've become[/tab]

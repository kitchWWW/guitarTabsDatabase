This is a great and easy song, by a great band. If you're just learning guitar this 
be real easy. It's only my second submitted tab, and I literally figured the guitar
2 part in five minutes, so it might not be completely accurate. If you hear something
I missed, tweak it to your liking, you're all musicians. This should be a good basis.

The bar chords are an alternative to the open chords. It might make it easier, it might 
it harder. I think the open chords sound better, but it's up to you.[/tab]

I’m pretty sure it starts with that, but I can’t figure out exactly what he does. If you 
it out or have corrections, please email them to me.[/tab]

Pick each note/chord individually[/tab]

I think there is also some really quiet guitar work under the verse, but it’s probably 
to the intro and pre-verse. Good luck figuring it out.
==========
 Guitar 2
==========
Intro: C C Am G

C                           Am          G
I wish the words would fail me just for once
(Just once)
C                Am
Keep in incommunicado
G
(You don't say a word)
C
Look for the present tense
Am             G
And come to my senses
(Come pick me up)
C                 Am   G
Just like a despera-a-ado
(A-a-ado)

F
I talked for twenty minutes
F                                 D
By the time the party ended you'd forgotten
G                    D
I'm still thinking about it
           F       G~
Five years later

Pre-verse: C C Am G

C                       Am     G
You spoke an unfamiliar dialect
(Comme ca?)
C                     Am   G
Two and a half months over
(Over)
C                             Am             G
Next thing I knew someone had called for the check
(Check please)
C                          Am        G
And you were gone before I turned it over

F
I dreamed we were alone all night
F
In a house made out of beds
D
And nothing happened

G                D            F
I think about it every time I see you
C
That's when I try to remember
G                    D                F       C
There were never any terms we could agree to

F
Now can I please have a moment of your time?
F
(Can I please have a moment of your time?)
F                                    G
For I have the strength to change my mind.

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
Wine, women, and song[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
I tried them all it did not take me long[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
To figure I'd unlocked the door to happiness[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
I figured wrong with a capital "R"[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
All the baggage I brought wouldn't fit in a mid-size car[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
That's why I'm walking on eggshells down the Via Dolorosa[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
Hasn't got me any closer so far[/tab]


[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]E7[/ch]
Shacked up with a poet, found it wasn't my department[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]D7[/ch]
Now I study the poetry of the studio apartment[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Changing the catbox and baking the bread[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]E7[/ch]
I should have been paying the bills instead[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
Of paying homage to an image drawn from somebody else's head[/tab]


2x: [ch]Am[/ch],[ch]G[/ch],[ch]F[/ch],[ch]E[/ch]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Song, women, and wine[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]
You can't fool all the people all the time[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
But if you're trying, if you're looking, if you're lucky[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
You can always fool a few and feel fine,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Is the line between shame and dread[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
One grips the lungs one brains the head[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
But either one can crush, anyone can crush you[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
Once I dated an actor, she was working on a play[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
By opening night, we had nothing left to say[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
We hit the wall, it was not resilient[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
She said that she was hungrier than I was brilliant[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]
And who the hell was I to disagree?[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Didn't you used to be someone who meant something to me?[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Somebody who meant something to me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Someone who meant something to me[/tab]

2x: [ch]Am[/ch],[ch]E[/ch],[ch]F[/ch],[ch]C[/ch],[ch]E[/ch]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
Wine, women, and song[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
I tried them all it did not take me long[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
To figure I'd unlocked the door to happiness[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
I figured wrong[/tab]

Thanks to this wonderful youtube clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4klUCZPXQM

Also- the part that goes "Didn't you used to be..." I have no real clue how to figure 
one out. What I have there is just a super-simple version.

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I ain't going honky tonking anymore[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
And I know I've heard that said before[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Troubles all I've ever had [/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And it almost makes me bad[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]D7[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
But I ain't going honky tonking anymore[/tab]



Now my gal has really done me wrong

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
I guess that's why I hate to stay at home[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
For I always get the blues[/tab]
 
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And I've tried so hard to lose[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]D7[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
But I ain't going honky tonking anymore[/tab]



Somehow this life seems so unfair

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
I love a girl that just don't seem to care[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I give her everything I've had [/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Then she tries to treat me bad[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]D7[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
But I ain't going honky tonking anymore[/tab]

 

Now you have troubles that you need to drown

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
You can't do it by honky tonking round[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You may stay out every night[/tab]
 
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But you'll never win the fight[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]D7[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
So don't go honky tonking anymore[/tab]



Not that I have almost blowed my top

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
And something tells my I had better stop[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
So I'm changing all my ways[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And getting myself out of this daze[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]D7[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
And I ain't going honky tonking anymore[/tab]



Perhaps someday I will find a true love

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
A girl that's just as pure as stars above[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
One who knows how to be a wife[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And really loves me all her life[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]D7[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Then I won't go honky tonking anymore[/tab]

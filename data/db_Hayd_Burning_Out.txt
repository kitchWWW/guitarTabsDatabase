[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
 You're out of reach[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
At least that's how it seems[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
When you're lying next to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
 And it's hard to sleep[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
When you say your mind's at ease[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Well, that, I don't believe[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]         
You can't fool me, darling[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
No use in stalling[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Dsus4[/ch]
We're doomed and you know it too[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
Baby, just look at the stars[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Maybe that's all that we are[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Feel so close, but we're far away[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Further than we think that we are[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
Gravity pulls us apart[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]C[/ch]
Adding to the weight on my heart[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]G[/ch]
Used to shine bright in the dark[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Dsus4[/ch]
But, in the light, we've lost our spark[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
We're burning out[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
 Therе's parts of me[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Still clinging to our dreams[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
And all that we could bе[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
 But why pretend?[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
If we know that in the end[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
It'll cost us everything, oh[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]         
You can't fool me, darling[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
No use in stalling[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Dsus4[/ch]
We're doomed and you know it too[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
Baby, just look at the stars[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
  You'd rather stay and watch us burn[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Than run away and not get hurt[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
But we're burning out[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
But we're burning out[/tab]

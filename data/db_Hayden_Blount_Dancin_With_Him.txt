[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
If I had to guess I'd say she's buzzing by now[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
Causing a scene in a low cut blouse[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Taking a hit from a spirit cigarette[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
Stained by her lips in bright cherry red[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
And some poor fool he's taking her bait[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]
Buying her drinks with his monthly pay[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Taking his chance on a damsel in distress[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
But she likes to dance and she ain't done dancing yet[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Dancing[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
Dancing with him[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Dancing[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
Dancing with him[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
 I used to hate it when she[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Two-stepped, two-stepped on my toes[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
But I'd rather be stepped on than two-step alone cause she's[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Dancing[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
Dancing with him[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
If I had to guess I'd say they're halfway home[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
He's got more on his mind than taking off her clothes like[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Church bells ringing in his head[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
But she likes to dance and she ain't done dancing yet[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Dancing[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
Dancing with him[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Dancing[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
Dancing with him[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
 I used to hate it when she[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Two-stepped, two-stepped on my toes[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
But I'd rather be stepped on than two-step alone cause she's[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Dancing[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
Dancing with him[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
If I had to guess I'd say he woke up alone[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
With his head in his hands and a lump in his throat[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
And by the end of the night she'll be on to the next[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Cause she likes to dance but she's done dancing with him[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Dancing[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
Dancing with him[/tab]

Dancing[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
Dancing with him[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
 I bet he loved it when she[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Two-stepped, two-stepped on his toes[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
But he'd rather two-step two-step alone cause she ain't[/tab]

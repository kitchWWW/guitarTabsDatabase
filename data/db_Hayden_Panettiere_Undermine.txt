VERSE 1

[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Sometimes good intentions [/tab]
Don't come across so well
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                                         [ch]F[/ch]
Got me analysing everything that ain't worth thinking bout[/tab]

Just 'Cause I ain't lived through
The same hand that was dealt to you
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]F[/ch]
Doesn't make me any less or make any more of you[/tab]


PRE-CHORUS

[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]
I wouldn't trade my best day[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]
So you could validate[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]
All your fears[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
And if I only got one shot[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]
Won't waste it on a shadow box[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F[/ch]
I'll stand right here[/tab]


CHORUS

[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause it's all talk talk talk[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
Talking in the wind[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
It only slows you down when you start listening[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
And it's a whole lot harder to shine[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
Than undermine[/tab]
Yeah, undermine


VERSE 2

[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
The first mile is always harder[/tab]
When you're leaving what you know
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                                         [ch]F[/ch]
Won't blame you if you stay here waving to me as I go[/tab]

I always wish the best for you
I hoped that you would see me through
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]
My wildest dreams[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]F[/ch]
Yeah, the ones you thought I'd never meet[/tab]


PRE-CHORUS
                        
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]
Still, you would trade your best day[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
Just to have your way[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
All these years[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
But if you only had one shot[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
Maybe all this talk[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
Would disappear[/tab]


CHORUS

[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause it's all talk talk talk[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
Talking in the wind[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
It only slows you down when you start listening[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
And it's a whole lot harder to shine[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
Than undermine[/tab]
Yeah, undermine

[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Sometimes good intentions [/tab]

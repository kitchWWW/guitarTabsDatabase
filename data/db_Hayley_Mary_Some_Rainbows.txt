[Intro] (Fading in)
[ch]A[/ch]

[Verse 1] (about 00:11 in youtube)
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
I found your number in my high school phonebook[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
at the bottom of a cupboard in a dusty box today.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
I'd almost forgotten how you jumped, smiling,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
from the bridge and how they never found you.[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Though they searched all summer   and all the surfer boys came round[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]D[/ch]
with their slabs of beer but all the green bottles[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#m[/ch]
couldn't make you disappear[/tab]

[Chorus 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
Some rainbows[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
don't   lead to gold.[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
I flicked my finger through the   cascading letters,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
some were names I don't know now and some that I know better.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
I hope they're healthy in their love and have well-paid jobs[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
and save their bitter discontents for their online mobs.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
The first girl was Alison, the last girl was Zoe,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]C#m[/ch]
no matter which one that I ring, she ain't gonna know me.[/tab]

[Chorus 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
  Some   rainbows   don't   lead to gold,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]*
  some   roads   don't   lead to Rome.[/tab]

[Interlude]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
Lead to Rome,   let you go.[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
  You should not see beyond the years.[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C#m[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Man, the clouds were magical, time will sort the differences[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C#m[/ch]
Would've been harder when you're young[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
It's gonna be hard to let you go.[/tab]

[Pre-End]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
The first boy was Adam,   the last boy was Zachery,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bm[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
no   matter how I turn the pages,   it don't bring you back to me.[/tab]

[End-Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]*
  Some   rainbows   donâ€™t   lead to gold.[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Once a fair and handsome seal-lord lay his foot upon the sand[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
For to woo the fisher’s daughter and to claim her marriage hand[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
I have come in from the ocean, I have come in from the sea[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
And I’ll not go to the waves, love, lest ye come along with me[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Lord, long have I loved you as a selkie on the foam[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
I would gladly go and wed ye and be lady of your home[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
But I cannot go in to ocean, I cannot go into the sea[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
I would drown beneath you waves love if I went along with thee[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Lady, long have I loved you: I would have you from my wife[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
I shall stay upon your shore land though it robs me of my life[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
I’ll never go back to the ocean, never go back to the sea[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
I shall stay one night beside you though it be the death of me[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Lord I cannot go and wed thee all to watch my lover die[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Since I’ll not be left a widow I have a plan for us to try[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Let us speak with my grandmother who’s ever dwelt beside the sea[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
She may know some trick or treasure that I may wed my fair selkie[/tab]


[Verse 5]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
So they’ve gone to her grandmother’s little cottage by the sea[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
To inquire how the maiden could be wed to her selkie[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
For the seal-lord’s watery kingdom’d surely rob her of her breath[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
But to stay on land past midnight, that would surely be his death[/tab]


[Verse 6]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Lord I know not how to aid you, you may never live on shore[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
For your kind to live past dawning has never been seen before[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
But my mother had a seal coat that she buried ‘neath a tree[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
For she told me any wearer would become a fair selkie[/tab]


[Verse 7]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
So they’ve journeyed farther inland though the seal-lord’s getting weak[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
And she’s shouldering a shovel to unearth that thing they seek[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
And at the rising of the full moon, underneath the elfin oak[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                                        [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
She’s unearthed that very treasure of which her grandmother spoke[/tab]


[Verse 8]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
So just before the stroke of midnight they have made it back to sea[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
And she’s donned that magic seal-coat and become a maid selkie[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Now they’ve gone into the ocean, hand in hand into the sea[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
She has gone along, a fair seal-bride for her selkie[/tab]

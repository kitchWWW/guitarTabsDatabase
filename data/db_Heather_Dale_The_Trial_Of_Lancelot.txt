[Verse 1]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]F#[/ch]
King Arthur's knights they filled the table round,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]F#[/ch]
Save for one who stood before them.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]F#[/ch]
For once without a weapon,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]F#[/ch]
For once he stood in shame.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
The trial's charge was treason,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C#m[/ch]             [ch]F#[/ch]
And betrayal of an oath.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
And should his guilt be proven,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C#m[/ch]             [ch]F#[/ch]
Death would fall on traitors both.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]F#[/ch]
The knights would counsel Arthur's hard decision.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
And Lancelot, his head held high said,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C#m[/ch]      [ch]F#[/ch]
"I'm tried for love of Guinevere.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]B[/ch]
My crime was love."[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]F#[/ch]
The first to speak was Kay with sharpest tongue:[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]F#[/ch]
"He is a man like any other.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]F#[/ch]
The word of Kings command him,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]F#[/ch]
His heart does not obey.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
For all his strength and boldness,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C#m[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]
This knight's spirit is too weak.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
His crime has no excuses,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]             [ch]F#[/ch]
And no favours may he seek.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]F#[/ch]
The laws of Kings don't bend and can't be broken."[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
And Lancelot, his head held high said,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]      [ch]F#[/ch]
"I stand for love of Guinevere.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]B[/ch]
For pride in love."[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]F#[/ch]
"I know this knight right well," spoke bold Gawain,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]F#[/ch]
"And he has ever stood beside me.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]                    [ch]F#[/ch]
With steel he's answered insults,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]F#[/ch]
Defended chivalry.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
And oft this man contended[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C#m[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]
For the honour of your wife.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
His actions were not proper,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#m[/ch]                [ch]F#[/ch]
But should not cost him his life.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]F#[/ch]
His service past should earn of you some mercy."[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
And Lancelot his head held high said,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]      [ch]F#[/ch]
"I fought for love of Guinevere.[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
I'll fight for love."[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Sir Tristan spoke, "I love my uncle's wife.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
For her I gladly suffer,[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
She is my heart's delight.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Isolde, the one who tempts me,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
And she for whom I'm pure.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
My love for her confounds me,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
And is all of which I'm sure.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
I understand my brother's contradictions."[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
And Lancelot, his head held high said,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
"I cry my love for Guinevere.[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
I've cried for love."[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Spoke Galahad, the purest of them all:[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
"Have no fear of predilection.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
For though he is my father,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
He is my source of shame.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
He joined in sinful union[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
With my unbeguiling mother.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
And for all his claim at virtue,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
He has gone and bed another.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
The laws of God declare this act damnation."[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
And Lancelot, his head held high said,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
"I lie in love with Guinevere.[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
I've lied for love."[/tab]

[Verse 5]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
As Arthur wept, he called the wrath of heaven[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
On the lovers who'd betrayed him.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
On the knight he had called 'brother'[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Thought worthy of his trust.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
On the queen who'd hid deception,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Dm[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
Yet could say she loved him still.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
For lost innocence and beauty,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
And in justice for their guilt.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
King Arthur knew the only price for treason.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
And Lancelot, his head held high said,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
"I'll die in love with Guinevere.[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]
I'd die for love."[/tab]

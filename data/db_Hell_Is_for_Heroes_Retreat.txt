Drop D tuning
11 is eleven not two ones, commas to make it easier to understand,
these don't indicate any pauses etc...

As far as I can tell there are only two riffs, I think the verse riff is played
for the bridge, another quality song and the b-sides on the singles are good.

Just repeat these as many times as neccessary, I'm sorry if this is wrong,
the 11 might be a 12 but I think 11 sounds right and better anyhow, if anyone
does work out that there's a bridge riff please mail it to me thehotelfred@hotmail.com

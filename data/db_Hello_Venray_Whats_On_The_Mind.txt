lyrics

What's on the mind of someone who's in love
What's on the mind of someone who's in love

They can hear voices calling
altough they are not there
They can stop the rain from falling
with a million dark clouds in the air

What's on the mind of someone who's in love

We sat on a bench watching tv
I didn't hold her by the hand
but I wished she would hold me
I must haved set there for hours or more
And I still can't remember
wich single tv show I saw

What's on the mind of someone who's in love
What's on the mind of someone who's in love

You'll find it easy to hear
Voices calling loud and clear
You'll find it easy to see
Some raindrops never meant to be

What's on the mind of someone who's in love

She was so beatifull I couldn't believe my eyes
She was my girlfriend I was a lucky guy
We could dance forever under moon and sun
She was my girlfriend she was the only one

What's on the mind of someone who's in love

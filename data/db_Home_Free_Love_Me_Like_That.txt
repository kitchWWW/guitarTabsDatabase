[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
Every now and then I find you on my phone[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Snapshot images of us when we were[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
good as gold[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
Cayman Islands, your brown eyes,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
we had it so rough[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Back when nothing but the sand[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
could come between us[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
Comin' through it's like I'm[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
going back in time[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
To those you've met since then[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
it might look like I'm just some guy[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
That you posed with for those 5 years[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
of forever[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Picture perfect proof that we[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
were good together[/tab]

Yeah


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
We were kids, we were wild,[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]
and we were never getting older[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
We could do no wrong,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]
we always had a shoulder[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
We leaned in and I caved in,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
my parents taught me[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
No one I love could love me like that,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
but you loved me like that[/tab]

Yeah


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
Hesitated putting all this in a song[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
But lying to myself about you[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
isn't moving on[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Truth be told, girl,[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
in a way I hope you hear this[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Pull out your phone and take[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
a trip down memory lane with[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Me by your side, Georgia Nights,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#m[/ch]          [ch]Em7[/ch]
you and I, one last time[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
When we were kids, we were wild,[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
and we were never getting older[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
No one I love could love me like that,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
but you loved me like that[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]

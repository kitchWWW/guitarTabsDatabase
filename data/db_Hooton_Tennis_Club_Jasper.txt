Basically the same progression the entire song. Apart from the verse, playing Asus2 - A - Asus2 at the end 
of the A sounds pretty good.

[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch] [ch]Asus2[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]Asus2[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]    x2

[Verse]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
We lost a great, great man today,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]
But outside is just another Wednesday.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
I'm sick of people passing me by,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]B[/ch]
How come we can't all stick around too long?[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
And a long time for yourself[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]B[/ch]
Can be a short time for everyone else.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
So we'll just have to wait and see[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]
If this feeling is overdue,[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]B[/ch]  
Is it true? [/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]
I can't believe it's true.[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
"Well, I'm just a stupid boy!"[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]B[/ch]
Yeah, that's what he'd always say.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
We'd go to galleries once in a while,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]                              [ch]B[/ch]
And stand around and look at paintings all day.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
There was a Matisse that I liked,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
There was a Turner that he loved.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
We had it printed and he put it in his living room,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]
It looked great.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]
Yeah, it looks great![/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]
For goodness sake.[/tab]

[Outro]

[ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch] [ch]Asus2[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]Asus2[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]     x6

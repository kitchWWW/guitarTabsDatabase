[tab][ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
When I was a nipper, I boarded a clipper, [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]  
Sailed the seas as a goods importer, Oh! [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Edward Teach is my name, but I earned my fame, [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]  
As Blackbeard the pirate of the water, Oh! [/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Was a jolly chap, with a jaunty cap, [/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch] 
Always gave my crew good quarter, Oh! [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
But I'm best known for, blood and guts and gore, [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]                 
And a viscous reign of murdering and slaughter, Oh![/tab]
     
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
 CREW: Best known for, blood and guts and gore, [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch] 
       And a viscous reign of murdering and slaughter, Oh! [/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Left my home in Bristol, with a sword and pistol, [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
Bid a fond farewell to ol' Blighty, Oh! [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
What my enemies feared, was my think black beard, [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]   
Which I always enjoyed setting light to, Oh![/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]                                              
Once I had a thing for a captive's lovely ring, [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
That shone like a jewel in the nighty-oh! [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]  
When the man said 'no', I just said 'oh,' [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
And chopped of his hand and said 'righty-oh!'[/tab]
     
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
 CREW: Man said 'No.' He said 'Oh,'[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch] 
       Chopped of his hand and said 'righty-oh!'[/tab]

*******************************************
Oh, I love to sail the ocean, 
With my flag that inspired emotion,
   Crew: With its smiling pile of skull and bones, 
   Smashing hearts with a violent, stabbing motion. 
And I love to escape detection,
And to win my crew's affection.
   Crew: Which was nothing to do with the twelve guns he wore 
   On his belt that were for protection.
*******************************************

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
I was awfully nice, but I had the odd vice,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
Which occasionally cause a commotion.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
The thing that I'd do was shoot members of my crew,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
If they didn't show enough devotion.[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
 Crew: The thing he'd do was shoot members of the crew,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
       If they didn't show enough devotion.[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Once when very Irate, I shot my first mate,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
Israel Hands for a bit of pleasure, Oh![/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
And when my debts grew, killed half of my crew, [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]  
To increase my share of the treasure, Oh![/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Was doing well then, seemed to run out of men,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
My captives boarded at their leisure, Oh![/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Smote me dead then cut of my head,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
And displayed it on my mast for good measure, Oh![/tab]

[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
 Crew: Smote him dead, chopped off his head,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
       Displayed it on the mast for good measure, Oh! [/tab]

Apologies for the lack of chords in the middle.
I'm still trying to find ones that work, so any additions would be fantablious. :)
(I currently do it A cappella in a Falsetto voice for giggles ;) )

Oil field town in a blood red sky[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]   
way out here that sun takes a long time to die[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]       
just seventeen when the highway called[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]      
my mama said "boy don't send me no tears back to Wichita Falls"[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]               
Yeah, broken white line led me away[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]     
down a long lonesome interstate[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]  
my boots move fast but my mind move slow[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch] 
wherever easy money went I was gonna go[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]  
Now my poor mama cries for the trouble I'm in[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]   
but the law don't believe me it was self defense[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]   
her heart breaks down against these prison walls[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
there's a few more tears tonight over Wichita Falls[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]  
there's a few more tears tonight over Wichita Falls[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                     
I was raised up that that where God lost his shoes[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
turned that west Texas dust into big city blues[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
that city kid pushed me just a little too far[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]             
reckon I pushed back just a little too hard[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch] 
Now my poor mama cries for the trouble I'm in[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]D[/ch]
but the law don't believe me it was self defense[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
her heart breaks down against these prison walls[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]   
there's a few more tears tonight over Wichita Falls[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]    
Yeah, my poor mama cries for the trouble I'm in[/tab]
[tab]                                                      [ch]D[/ch] 
but the law don't believe me mama hell it was self defense[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]              
my life sure don't mean much inside these prison walls[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]

Artist: Hum
Song: Diffuse
Genre: 
Key: Bm


Those whose are more musically atuned can mess around with what each chord, sometimes i like to play B5 at the
verse makes it sound way heavier. Look its rough, but its on here so thought would be nice
for those wanting to play along. COuld probably play A5 if wanted to.
Strum i just know to do not to direct, if you listen can figure it out

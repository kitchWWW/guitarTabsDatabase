Running from the wall
Trying to do the right thing
But it all is getting wrong again
Doing exactly what we're told

Not waiting on a word
Tie us together while you can
Getting it wrong again

Ooh
Am I far enough away?
Am I far enough away
For you today?
Am I far enough away?

Like battles on a wall
They're inviting me
To watch them when they fall
Getting wrong again

Ooh
Am I far enough away?
Am I far enough away?
Am I far enough away?
Am I far enough away
For you today?

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
I took my time, and got a little lost[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
I was not told, and had a feeling I'd been crossed[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
If you think I'm looking a little grey[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
It's just the way I'm feeling these days[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Is this the us you've fallen for?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
If it is then we're done for[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Is this the us you've fallen for?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I guess it's what we all long for[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                           [ch]C[/ch]
If we'd have thought about the walls we'd have to climb[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                           [ch]C[/ch]
Would we see this through and feel like everything was just fine?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
If you see me looking the other way[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
It's just the way I'm looking these days[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Is this the us you've fallen for?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
If it is then we're done for[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Is this the us you've fallen for?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I guess it's what we all long for[/tab]

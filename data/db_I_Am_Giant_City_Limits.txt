Intro

[ch]Em[/ch], [ch]Dsus[/ch]

Verse 1

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
     If I had of known it[/tab]
Then I would have shown it
My frustration with this old town
[tab][ch]Dsus[/ch]
        You can brush it under[/tab]
But it always comes back
It’s still following you around

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
     And the city limits[/tab]
Keep on getting bigger
Just when you thought you had made it out
[tab][ch]Dsus[/ch]
       And you’re sick of waiting,[/tab]
Lying on the pavement
Try’na get out of this old town

Pre-Chorus

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
   She confides that    she wants a little more[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
   Are we living?    Are we living?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
   She confides that    she wants a little more[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]   
   Are we living? Or merely killing time[/tab]

[ch]Em[/ch], [ch]Dsus[/ch] (Bass riff)

Verse 2

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
     Looking at the ceiling[/tab]
Try’na shake the feeling
That you just may have missed your time
[tab][ch]Dsus[/ch]
        Tearing up your ticket[/tab]
Did you think you won it?
Make a killing in this old town

Pre-Chorus

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
   She confides that    she wants a little more[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
   Are we living?    Are we living?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
   She confides that    she wants a little more[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
   Are we living? Or merely killing time[/tab]

[ch]Em[/ch], [ch]Dsus[/ch] (Bass riff)

Chorus

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Dsus[/ch]
Ohhh feeling like I should get away[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
Feeling like I should get away[/tab]
I’m sorry that you know…
I’m sorry that you
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]Dsus[/ch]
Knooow feeling like I should get away[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
Feeling like I should get away[/tab]
I’m sorry that you know
I’m sorry that you

[tab][ch]Em[/ch], [ch]Dsus[/ch]
Know[/tab]

Verse 3

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
     If I had of known it[/tab]
Then I would have shown it
My frustration with this old town
[tab][ch]Dsus[/ch]
        And the paint is fading[/tab]
On the car that’s waiting
Around the corner to take you out
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
     Past the city limits[/tab]
Past the point of living
Over the border of yesterday
[tab][ch]Dsus[/ch]
        Biting on the bullet[/tab]
Do you really want it?
Dying for your chance to feel alive

[ch]Em[/ch], [ch]Dsus[/ch] (Bass riff)

Chorus

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Dsus[/ch]
Ohhh feeling like I should get away[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
Feeling like I should get away[/tab]
I’m sorry that you know…
I’m sorry that you
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]Dsus[/ch]
Knooow feeling like I should get away[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
Feeling like I should get away[/tab]
I’m sorry that you know

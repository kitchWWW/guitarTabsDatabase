[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]              [ch]Gm[/ch]
As lucid as the dream,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]Eb[/ch]
Where you wake behind the wheel.[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Gm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]Eb[/ch]
Strange that you should feel pa- ra- lysed.[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Gm[/ch]
The dream where you can fly, [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]Eb[/ch]
And you rise above your hometown, [/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Gm[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
And tell them they can keep their gravity.[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]Dm[/ch]
Are you wide awake?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Bb[/ch]
Caught in the crossfire, caught in the crash.[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Dm[/ch]
Are you wide awake?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
Born in the crossfire, living the crash.[/tab]

[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]              [ch]Gm[/ch]
As lucid as the punch,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]Eb[/ch]
You're throwing in slow-motion.[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Gm[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]Eb[/ch]
A fist you cannot lift, a fight you cannot win.[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Gm[/ch]
And would you really die,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]Eb[/ch]
If you hit the bottom?[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Gm[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
If the ground didn't wake you up in the fall-ing dream.[/tab]

Are you wide awake?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Bb[/ch]
Caught in the crossfire, caught in the crash.[/tab]

Are you wide awake?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
Born in the crossfire, living the crash.[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]                                      [ch]Dm/A[/ch]
Smashing your way through the looking-glass.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]                      [ch]Dm/A[/ch]        [ch]Bb[/ch]     [ch]Dm[/ch]
Fantasy can still be razor-sharp - for you.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bb[/ch]
For you who wanted everything, [/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
You who promised everything.[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]Bb[/ch]    
Something followed you back,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Gm[/ch]
And woke up in the crash.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
Somehow, followed you out of your domain.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bb[/ch]
Something followed you back,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Gm[/ch]
Out through the looking-glass, [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]
Somehow bringing a cloud of the surreal.[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]Dm[/ch]
Are you wide awake?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Bb[/ch]
Caught in the crossfire, caught in the crash.[/tab]

Are you wide awake?[/tab]

Are you wide awake now?

Now are you,

Are you wide awake now?

Are you wide awake now?

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch](add [ch]G[/ch])    [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
 I laughed along to the park bench crack[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch](add [ch]G[/ch])    [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
 The lines of friendship drawn were slack[/tab]

 Those times have gone,      can’t come back[/tab]

 I was young and I had a mouth on me[/tab]


Verse 2 (same chords as verse 1):

They said there’s someone I should see
A world of shelves opened up for me
A kite dragged along a lowly breeze
We were young and I had a mouth on me

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]
 We were young and there was no-one to be[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]
Don’t think that tomorrow, the things you have borrowed[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
Will be lost on the feeling, while your senses are reeling[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
If it sounds like the laughter that once you were after[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]
Got caught in the echo, of all your tomorrows[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Am/G[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
You can let go again, let go again[/tab]

Hours stretched by a sunny day
The street light glow was my sweet malaise
So much to kick at and never say
We were young and I had a mouth on me
We were young and there was nowhere to be

        Don’t think that …

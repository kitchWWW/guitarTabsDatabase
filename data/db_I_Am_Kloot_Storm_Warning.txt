intro
------------------
intro is basically picking the base note of each chord and then lightly a few more
of the chords notes. this follows the same pattern throughout the song, becoming
heavier in parts and strumming in others.the sequence is-

[ch]Am[/ch]-[ch]C[/ch]-[ch]F[/ch]-E/[ch]E7[/ch] (it varies between [ch]E[/ch] & [ch]E7[/ch]- i just play [ch]E7[/ch] all the time)

second verse lyrics-
-------------------

i would have kept you free from harm, rang the bells or raised alarms,

I would have them all at bay, except i thought i heard you say,

you're the leper boy you cant come in, the monkey god is now your king,

youre out, youre in, youre out, youre in, youre out, youre in, youre out

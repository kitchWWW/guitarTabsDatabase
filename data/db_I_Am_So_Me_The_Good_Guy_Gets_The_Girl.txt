[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
It sure feels great to be on top[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
To be the one no one can stop[/tab]
I'm blessed to be one in a million
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
I suited up to get undressed[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
A pretty boy in a pretty mess[/tab]
To see the hint you'll have to look quite close

[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause you don't get to know it if you don't dare to ask[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
And I'm not gonna show it if you don't show me class[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
Not as hard as you think if you can handle the cash[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
This night is all about the bling-bling ka-ching [/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'll pick her up, she is Miss California[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Not gonna stop 'til the night turns to mornin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                   [ch]D[/ch]
She'll get the rush she's been dreaming of forever [Go, Go, Go, Go][/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I took a shot now she's calling my name, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Trained to be tamed but she couldn't be blamed, [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I know these things always end up the same [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
The good guy gets the girl[/tab]

(The same chords in the rest of the song)

We'll take the bus, she lives downtown
I get the vibes from all around
Sincere and thoughtful we are right on time
I get the taste of something sweet
The heat goes up between the sheets
My heartbeat's pumping, it's a boom-boom-pow

'Cause her makeup is messed up and all over her face
And I bet that she's gonna be all over the place
When I smile say goodbye and she won't see me in days
Last night was all about the bling-bling ka-ching 

I'll pick her up, she is Miss California
Not gonna stop 'til the night turns to mornin'
She'll get the rush she's been dreaming of forever [Go, Go ,Go, Go]
I took a shot now she's calling my name, yeah
Trained to be tamed but she couldn't be blamed, 
I know these things always end up the same 
The good guy gets the girl

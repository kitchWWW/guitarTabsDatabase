Artist: I Am X-Ray
Song: Pretty Rave Girl
Genre: 
Key: 


  you can mess around with the capo to fit your vocal range better, but this 
sounds right to me.    

[tab]intro: [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
and just repeat it all the way through.  for the slow parts just strum each chord once.[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
I know this pretty rave girl[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
Always think about her[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
And when she says hi to me[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
Butterflies go right through me[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
And When I see her dancing[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
Wanna take a chance [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
And get in a little closer[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
And maybe get to know her[/tab]

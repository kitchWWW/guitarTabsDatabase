Such a catchy song I tell you I love I blame coco.
enjoy!

I want to annoy
And I’m going to enjoy it
Merely cause we’re bored
Merely because we’re bored
Cause all you do is hope
You’re all fucking hopeless
And it’s the Lord of the Flies all over again
It’s the Lord of the Flies all over again

Now who holds the show
Will be Caesar
You can even have it written on your T-shirt
Now who holds the show
Will be Caesar
You can even have it written on your T-shirt
Here we go

King of the hopeless will fall
We’re gonna knock down the walls
Sing in the Caesar with force
We’re gonna knock down these doors

I’ve heard it all before
And I chose to ignore it
There’s someone at your door
There’s somebody at your door

Prepare for the test
You’ll all get infested
Now it’s the Miligram device all over again
It’s the Miligram device all over again

Now who holds the show
Will be Caesar
You can even have it written on your T-shirt
Now who holds the show
Will be Caesar
You can even have it written on your T-shirt
Here we go

King of the hopeless will fall
We’re gonna knock down the walls
Sing in the Caesar with force
We’re gonna knock down the walls
We’re gonna knock down these doors

Hey Caesar
Yo Coco
Hello Geezer
Hey Mama
Can you fly?
Yep
I thought Robins can fly
Whatever
Huh?

We’re gonna knock down the walls

King of the hopeless will fall
We’re gonna knock down the walls
Sing in the Caesar with force
We’re gonna knock down the walls
Knock down the walls
King of the hopeless will fall
Knock down the walls
Sing in the Caesar with force
Knock down the walls

I’m going to enjoy it

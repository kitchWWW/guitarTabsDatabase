[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Fall into flames and you won't do it again[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
You've learned a lesson that you've never been taught so[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Crawl into blame that you will never reclaim[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
It is a blessing that you'll never get caught oh[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]
But underneath we are golden[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Hold them, we made them[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Our hearts beat control them[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Too fast, too fast for me tonight[/tab]

[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
I've seen souls in spirit golden[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
And I've seen souls in spirit gold[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
Now I've cleaned myself from that unsettling light[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
It was too bright for me and the love in my life[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]
But if you capture me I'll be within your sight[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                            [ch]G[/ch]
It was too bright for me, it was too bright tonight[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
It was too bright tonight[/tab]

Before the insults and post the praise
You are the subject of a sugarcoat crosshair
During the shell shock of a crystal maze
You are important at your opening funfair

However underneath we are golden
So hold them we saved them
Our heartbeats, control them
They're too fast, too fast for me tonight

I've seen souls in spirit golden
And I've seen souls in spirit gold
Now I've cleaned myself from that unsettling light
It was too bright for me and the love in my life
But if you capture me I'll be within your sight
It was too bright for me, it was too bright tonight
It was too bright tonight

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Here by a circus on this moonlit night[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
With the lukewarm light is not too frightening[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Here by a settle at the starboard side[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
If you only vouch for me[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
On this golden night[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]
on this golden night[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
Oh my burning eyes[/tab]

I see souls in spirit golden
I see souls in spirit gold
Now that I've cleaned myself from that unsettling light
It was too bright for me and the love in my life
But if you capture me I'll be within your sight
It was too bright for me
It was too bright tonight

VERSE

[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
You may point with the crooked cane[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G#[/ch]
You conspire on my broken brain[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Cm[/ch]                      [ch]G#[/ch]
And playwright fate will have his way[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Fm[/ch]
We're all actors in this play[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]     [ch]Cm[/ch]                                [ch]G#[/ch]
And soon enough the brakes won't take the weight[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Fm[/ch]
That is depending, and it's the strain on my left arm takes[/tab]

I'm just hoping for a happy ending[/tab]

You're in a land where you don't belong[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Cm[/ch]
Just keep kissing through the kissing song[/tab]

You're in a land where you don't belong[/tab]

VERSE

[tab]          [ch]G#[/ch]
I'm gonna die here beautifully[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]Fm[/ch]
Now the housecat's on his seventh life[/tab]

He said his goodbyes to his beautiful wife[/tab]

He said he's going to a place where beasts like us roam free[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Fm[/ch]
He said come with me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
He said come with me[/tab]

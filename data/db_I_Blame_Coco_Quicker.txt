Song: Quicker
Genre: 
Key: 


This is a tab of the acoustic version of Quicker

I don't know the exact names of the chords but I think this will do.

The chords:
[ch]Em7[/ch]: 022033
[ch]G/F#[/ch]:200233
[ch]Cadd9[/ch]:032033

[tab]The song begins with a riff
E|-------------------------------------------|
B|-------------------------------------------|
G|-------------------------------------------|
D|-------------------------------------------|
A|-----------------2-2-0---2-2-0-------------|
E|0-0-2-3--0-0-2-3-------3------3------------|[/tab]

And you basically play this through the whole verse

[tab]I [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] waste
And you shall be waiting here[/tab]
You are the place
And you can place me anywhere
We're on our way
We're on our way away from here

[tab]          [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
But if we don't stop now[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G/F#[/ch]
Instead of living in this old horse town[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I want it back in again[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Let it devour my skin[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G/F#[/ch]
But we won't start now[/tab]

[tab]                    [ch]Em7[/ch]      [ch]G/F#[/ch]
If we could only be Quicker[/tab]
[tab][ch]G/F#[/ch]                   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
    And be quick to be kind[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Em7[/ch]      [ch]G/F#[/ch]
If we could only be faster[/tab]
[tab][ch]G/F#[/ch]                       [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
    Then we could outsmart time[/tab]


Here you start that riff again

I am afraid
Afraid of losing time
You are the race
And I'll be racing your mind

Same chords as said above

But if we don't stop now
Instead of living in this old horse town
I want you back in again
Let you devour my skin
But we won't start now

If we could only be Quicker
And be quick to be kind
If we could only be faster
Then we could outsmart time
If we could only be Quicker
And be quick to be kind
If we could only be faster
Then we could outsmart time

In this part you play the same chords but in a different strumming pattern.

So hold me as I hold you
Hold me 'til I drown
Well you could be Quicker
And quick becomes the sound
So hold me as I hold you
Hold me to the ground
Well I could be faster
And fast becomes the high

If you could only be Quicker
You'd be quick to be kind
If you could only be faster
Then you could outsmart time

If we could only be Quicker
And be quick to be kind
If we could only be faster
Then we could outsmart time

So hold me as I hold you
Hold me to the ground

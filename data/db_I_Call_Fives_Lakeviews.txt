[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
You like to think[/tab]

You like to think that nothing's changing
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]
But you're alone in this[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
and there's a reason[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
It's hard to admit when you know that you're wrong[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Cm[/ch]                        [ch]C#[/ch]
When every line and every lie is piling on[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]   [ch]C#[/ch]     [ch]Fm[/ch]
Now I ask of you,[/tab]

Just don't let me down
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]
Just don't let me down[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]   [ch]C#[/ch]     [ch]Fm[/ch]
Now I ask of you,[/tab]

Don't be sorry now
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]
Don't be sorry now[/tab]

[ch]G#[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]G#[/ch]
I'd rather be home safe and warm in my bed[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cm[/ch]
Far away from the world and the things that you said[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G#[/ch]
I won't stand by your side and beg for affection[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cm[/ch]
I shouldn't have to scream just to get your attention[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Fm[/ch]   [ch]D#[/ch]               [ch]C#[/ch]
And I'll save revenge for another day[/tab]

I'm losing sleep again[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D#[/ch] 2                           [ch]C#[/ch]
And I'm constantly reminded of the times that we tried[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G#[/ch]
to be friends[/tab]

You never cared
[tab]    [ch]D#[/ch] 2                               [ch]C#[/ch]
So where were you when no one else was there?[/tab]

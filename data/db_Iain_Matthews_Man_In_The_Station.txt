[Verse 1]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
There's a man in the station and a train in the rain,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em7[/ch]
There's a face in the mirror that's showing the strain,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
There's a woman in the dark that's standing apart,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
There's a love in the man that's breaking his heart.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]Em7/G[/ch]  [ch]D/F#[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home,[/tab]
[ch]Em7/G[/ch]  [ch]D/F#[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]


[Verse 2]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
Now there's a one more circle I'm dying to try,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em7[/ch]
There's a piece of my head that's asking why,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
There's a piece of my heart that's dying to fly,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
There's a baby in the woman that's waiting to cry.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]Em7/G[/ch]  [ch]D/F#[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7/G[/ch]    [ch]D/F#[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
The next train home.[/tab]


[Instrumental]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Em7/G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
     Next train home.[/tab]

Next train home.[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
Well, there's got to be a way for a lazy face,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em7[/ch]
To get up and start loving the human race,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
There's just got to be a way for a crazy face,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
Get out from under this paper chase.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]Em7/G[/ch]  [ch]D/F#[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home,[/tab]
[ch]Em7/G[/ch]    [ch]D/F#[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]

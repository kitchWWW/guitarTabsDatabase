[Verse 1]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Oh, God said to me "Gonna kick your ass, 'cos all you do is ask, ask, ask[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
All that energy looking for me, when I'm sitting here inside you, plain to see[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
How I built you cell for cell, gave you sights to see, I gave you tales to tell[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Even let you help yourself for a while, to take some weight off this busy child."[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Now I said to God "I found you out, 'cos I know what this life is all about!"[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
And God said "Stop, don't scramble your brain, my opponent's been messing you around again[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
See him and me, are enemies, and we play little games for galaxies[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
And he's inside you and I am too, so here we are, just the three of you[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Oh, we made mistakes, too many cards, but making human beings can be hard[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
A God gets tired of playing so much chess, he wishes his God would get him out of his mess."[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
I said to God "What's it like to die?" He said "It's as plain as the sea and sky[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Conception was me and him and you, when your batteries fade, we all just move on."[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Oh, I said to God "Who's winning this game? Is the Devil in front? He said "Is that his name?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
You know I've been so busy I never asked, I never looked up from this awesome task."[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
I said to God "What's good and bad?" He said "It's just something that you've gotta have[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
It don't mean nothing to us up here, but you're primitive people, you gotta have fear."[/tab]


[Verse 5]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Now I said to God "Do I think for myself? He said "I told you once you just help yourself[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Don't you forget you're composed of three, your thinking comes from him and me."[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Now I said to God "How big are you? Is there a religion? Is it true?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
How big's the universe? Is time, the same for you, as my life is to mine?"[/tab]


[Verse 6]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Oh, He said "If all the things that made worlds float, were all to part, then you would note[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
The size of him and the size of me and that's how big we both shall be."[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
He said "The universe is small, just like some fortune-teller's ball[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
And we both sit down and we play the game, when somebody wins, it all starts again[/tab]


[Verse 7]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
There's no religion, you did that, it helps to keep your little leaders fat[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Like faith and superstition stay, to help you pass the time away[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
But when you talk of time and life, it makes me think of circles and heights[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Expansion is the clue, your dreams are nearer than you've ever been[/tab]


[Verse 8]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Now you see my little toy to think, is from two bowls of wine to drink[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Don't take too much or you may drown, behave yourself, see you around."[/tab]

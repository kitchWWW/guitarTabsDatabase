[Intro]

[ch]E[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
They called me the idiot, my hands were on fire[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]
Blood flowed from my fingers every time I pressed the wires[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Exiled to the attic, out of harm's way[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
I hit that bow and arrow till I hit the hay[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
I got a suitcase full of energy, I'm following the wind[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
Old enough to know better young enough to join in[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
Lived opposite a graveyard, you could hear the hookers cry[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
"You never paid me last week, so you ain't gettin' nothin' tonight!"[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
It's been a long time. It's been a long time[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
Hangin' out in Lynn's Cafe 1959[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]A7[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
We ran the streets together and we never had a dime[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
It's been a long time, it's been a long, long, long, long time[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
Still life never moved me or the friends that I chose[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]E[/ch]
They was always up to something, as the saying goes[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
The road to good intentions was starting to fray[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
And then I met a lunatic who showed me the way[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
It's been a long time. It's been a long time[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
Well 'no' is not an option when your ass is on the line[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]A7[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
I didn't need no lawyer, I was desperate to sign[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
It's been a long time, it's been a long, long, long, long time[/tab]


[Instrumental]
[ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
[ch]A[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]
[ch]A[/ch] [ch]A7[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
[ch]A[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]


[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Be careful what you wish for, dreams can come true[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
I was used to failure, and this was something new[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
We tripped the light fandango till we ran out of steam[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
And then one by one we fell off the end of a dream[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
It's been a long time, it's been a long time[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
You take a chance on destiny, you never know what you'll find[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]A7[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
Fortune and misfortune are forever entwined[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
It's been a long time, it's been a long, long, long, long time[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
It's been a long time. It's been a long time[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
You've been going your way, and I've been going mine[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]A7[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
I wasn't born in the U.S.A. but I'm that way inclined[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]                                              [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]Asus4[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
It's been a long time. It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]A7[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
So if you're ever in the vicinity,   drop me a line[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]            N.C.
It's been a long time. It's been a long,, long, long, long...[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]Em7/C[/ch] x4


[Verse 1]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Em7/C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
I'm waiting on an elevator in a hotel out in California[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                                  [ch]D[/ch]
Smog clouds up in the windows, but there is a plaque up on the wall[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Em7/C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
That tells of the Agoras, people who were here long before us[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7/C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
     Before the covered wagons, before they lost it all[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]Em7/C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
They were hunters, they were fishermen and they often fought each other[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                              [ch]D[/ch]
But one small tribe was different, their leader was a peaceful man[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]Em7/C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
They were weavers, they were painters, trading pelts for pretty colours[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em7/C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Protected by the warriors for the beauty in their hands[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Em7/C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Em7/C[/ch]
Roll back the years, roll back the years, to the river of tears[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]Em7/C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
The chief he had a daughter, she was young and she was beautiful[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                         [ch]D[/ch]
He said, "Go into the forest, get some berries for the dye[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]Em7/C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
But make your way back quickly, for the old bear's getting hungry[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7/C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]D[/ch]
  I  don't want you out there, when the sun falls from the sky"[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]Em7/C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
Her basket filled with berries, she headed back toward the village[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                           [ch]D[/ch]
When a mighty roar erupted, she ran und hid inside a hollow tree[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]Em7/C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
And the shadows were getting longer, the forest was getting colder[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em7/C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
And the chief began to panic, where could his daughter be[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Em7/C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Em7/C[/ch]
Lost in the years, lost in the years, on the river of tears[/tab]


[Instrumental]
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]Em7/C[/ch] x2


[Verse 5]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]Em7/C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
In the camp the fires were dying, when the old chief started crying[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                                 [ch]D[/ch]
Soon all the tribe were crying, the ground grew wet beneath their feet[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]Em7/C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
And the tears they turned to water and the water became a river[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em7/C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
And the river flowed like an arrow, to the foot of a hollow tree[/tab]


[Verse 6]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]Em7/C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
And the girl looked out in wonder, as she saw the water falling[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                   [ch]D[/ch]
She knew it was her father and she swam to his canoe[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]Em7/C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
And all the tribe stopped crying, and the river started subsiding[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em7/C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Into the hill of the Agoras, and so the legend grew[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
Roll back the years, roll back the years[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Em7/C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Em7/C[/ch]
Roll back the years, roll back the years, ahh to the river of tears[/tab]


[Outro]

         I wish all the world was healing[/tab]

[ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]         
Well I lay underneath an ageless sky[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]          
I watched the universe breathing[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]                  
There's more going on up there than meets the eye[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]         
Give me something to believe in[/tab]

Which way's in and which way's out
Every step is misleading
Well which way is up which way is down
You gotta have something to believe in

Oh, let me dream, let me dream
I spend my whole life dreaming
I've been lucky but I'm still me
You gotta have something to believe in

I didn't mean to hurt the people I hurt
I was full of fear and loathing (uh...Correct?)
I wasn't up to much, but I was all I had to go on
Couldn't find nothing to believe in

I don't like all them man made religions
They all need a little spiritual healing
They don't cut across race, they don't cut across culture
But we all need something to believe in

So you believe what you want to believe
Just stay true to your feelings
'Cause one man's god's just as good as another now
Gotta have something to believe in

Well I lay underneath a royal throne
The ? paint was peeling
Half an inch deep and twice as cheap
Oh give me something to believe in

Fat Fred always packing lead
On the corner dealing
Makes more in a night than I can make in forty days
Give me something to believe in
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Now people worship what they see[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Looks can be deceiving[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Violence rages in abandoned hearts[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]    
'Cause they ain't got nothing to believe in[/tab]

The chill chill is a bitter pill
When it comes to leaving
'Cause there ain't no easy way outta here
When you ain't got nothing to believe in

[ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

Just woke up in Sarajevo city
I watched all those mothers screaming
Kids getting shot and for what, and for what?
Give me something to believe in
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Now there's fire outside, mud that slides[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
Earthquakes shake the region[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Willy and the Poorboys lost in America[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
They ain't got nothing to believe in[/tab]

For every seed of knowledge found
For every grain of reason
For every shred of decency
There's something to believe in

Now I lay me down to rest
In the silence of the evening
And the moon road shines from here to eternity
I've got something to believe in

You believe what you want to believe
Just stay true to your feelings
'Cause one man's god's just as good as another
I've got something to believe in.

For those who might be interested,
I'm trying post 23A Swan hill in the near future.

Just need to figure out the riff.

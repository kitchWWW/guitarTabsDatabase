[Intro]
[ch]A[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                                    [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
On the night of my 21st birthday, I was playing in a pub back room[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                     [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
When a local dude informed me of my impending doom[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
 Apparently I'd sullied the reputation of[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                                     [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
The best left hook in the business, now, he's looking for my blood[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                                     [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
There's a thug in every doorway and it's coming up to closing time[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                                        [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
The best left hook in the business puts, his chair right next to mine[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
And my heart was pushing like a funny car, just before the start of a race[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                                    [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
This ain't no time to panic boy, you better get your head on straight[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 1]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
I left my guitar on the top of the bar, my jacket and coat on the seat[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
I'm over the counter, I'm up the back stairs, they all thought I was taking a leak[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
I fly through the air with the greatest of ease, out of the window and into the breeze[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
I land on my feet and I'm picking up speed, and all I could think was, "You'll never catch me"[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
When you got to get away, you got to get away[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
When you got to get away, it's true[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
When you got to get away, got to get away[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Especially if the other guy is bigger than you[/tab]


[Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
There ain't no rhyme, there ain't no reason, just people going over the top[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
The winners are losers, the losers are covered in blood and they can't get it off[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
I fly through the air with the greatest of ease, out of the window, over the trees[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
I land on my feet and I'm picking up speed, and all I could think was, "You'll never catch me"[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
If you got to get away, it's true[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
If you got to get away, got to get away[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
 That was my great escape. That was my big adventure[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
 That was my brush with danger. That was my Alamo, baby[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
 I heard alarm bells ringing. I heard the fat lady singing[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I seen the club when he came out swingin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I seen his eyes when I gave him the finger[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
 Those days are over, it's been good to know ya[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]E[/ch]
 You're just a stone age daydream[/tab]

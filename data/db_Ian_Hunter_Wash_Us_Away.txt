Repeat through this:

On the very first decade that we got to dream in
Our fathers were angry, our mother's were screamin'
At the clothes we were wearin' and the music we got off on
Hitler was dead, welcome to Babylon

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Carved our initials out across the sand[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
The heart and the arrow, no-one understands[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Then the tide rolled in and everything ran[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
And washed us away, washed us away, washed us away[/tab]


[tab]Part1                                 [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
Up in the attic ambition was burning[/tab]
[tab]Part1                                                     [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
Now my fingers were bleedin' but the tables were turning[/tab]
[tab]Part1                                      [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
Down in the city the future was beckoning[/tab]
[tab]Part1                                       [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
And I hated myself on the day of reckoning[/tab]

(Oh yeah)
Carved our initials on top of the cake
The heart and the arrow - the rattle and the snake
How was I to know that the Earth was gonna break
And wash us away, wash us away, wash us away


[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
Everything's temporary in this world[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]C[/ch]
Ain't it a shame when you lose someone[/tab]
[tab][ch]G5[/ch]
Here tomorrow, gone today[/tab]
Wash us away, wash us away, wash us away

Play Intro Riff during this Verse:

There was never a fool like a young fool alone in
A world without someone he can find a home in
And for all the wrong reasons we rescued each other
You bandaged my heart I never would recover  C F
(ohhhh)

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
No river runs true, it always takes a twist[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Hearts can be broken, arrows gonna miss[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
How was I to know that it was gonna come down to this[/tab]

And wash us away
And we wrote our names on the Dead Sea Scrolls
The young and the restless, the brave and the bold
How was we to know it was gonna get outta control
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
And wash us away, wash us away, wash us away, wash us away, wash us away,wash[/tab]
          G---->
us away, wash us away

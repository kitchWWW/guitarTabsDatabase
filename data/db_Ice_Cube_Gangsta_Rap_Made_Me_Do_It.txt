[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
You lookin' at the grand wizard[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Warlord, vocal chord so vicious[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
And I don't have to show riches[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
To pull up, pull off with some bad bitches[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
And it ain't about chivalry[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                           [ch]Bb[/ch]
It's about dope lyrics and delivery[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
It's about my persona[/tab]
Ain't nothin' like a man that can do what he wanna
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
Ain't nothin' like a man that you knew on the corner[/tab]
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
[tab]                          [ch]Dm[/ch]
See 'em throw up Westside California[/tab]
Nigga, I'm hot as Phoenix, Arizona
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]               [ch]Bb[/ch]
I'm Utah: I got multiple bitches[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]Dm[/ch]
It's a new law, keep a hold of your riches[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Bb[/ch]
Dumb nigga, don't spend it as soon as you get it[/tab]
And recognize I'm a captain and you a lieutenant

[Hook 1]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
I can say what I want to say[/tab]
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
[tab]                 [ch]F[/ch]
If I call you a nigga[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
I can act like an animal[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
If I eat you like a cannibal[/tab]
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
I'm raw as a dirty needle[/tab]
Choke an eagle, just to feed all my people
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Lyrically I'm so lethal[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Ice Cube is a saga[/tab]
Y'all spit saliva, and I spit lava
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
I got the fearless flow[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
Don't get near this, ho, if you scared to go[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
I keep it gangsta, and why should I change that?[/tab]
Fuck you old mothafuckas tryin' to change rap
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
But ain't you the same cat[/tab]
That sat back when they brought cocaine back?
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
I'm tryin' to get me a Maybach[/tab]
How you mothafuckas gonna tell me "don't say that"?
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
You the ones that we learned it from[/tab]
I heard nigga back in 1971

[Hook 2]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
So if I act like a pimp[/tab]
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
If I call you a nappy-headed ho[/tab]
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
If I shoot up your college[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
If I rob you of knowledge[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Thank God when I bless the mic[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
You finally get to hear the shit that you like[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
A nigga talkin' about real life[/tab]
So you can try to get this shit right
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Use your brain, not your back[/tab]
Use your brain, not a gat; it's a party, not a jack
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Don't be scared of them people[/tab]
Walk up in there and show them that you equal
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
And don't be material[/tab]
A nigga grew up on milk and cereal
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
I never forgot Van Ness and imperial[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Look at my life, Ice Cube is a miracle[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
It could be you if you was this lyrical[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
It could be her if she was this spiritual[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Bb[/ch]
‘Cause me and Allah go back like cronies[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]C[/ch]
I ain't gotta be fake, ‘cause he is my homie[/tab]

[Hook 3]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
If I sell a little crack[/tab]
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
If I die in Iraq[/tab]
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
If I take you for granted[/tab]
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
If I fuck up the planet[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it[/tab]

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Oh yeah, and another thing[/tab]
For all y'all niggas that don't do gangsta rap
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
Don't get on TV talkin' about gangsta rap[/tab]
‘Cause 9 times out of 10
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
You don't know the fuck you talkin' about[/tab]
Talk about that bullshit rap you do
[tab]                       [ch]Dm[/ch]
Stay the fuck out of mine[/tab]

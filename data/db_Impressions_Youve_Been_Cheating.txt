Chi-town does Motown in this curious battle between Chicago horns and
Detroit strings.  I guess the arranger (probably Johnny Pate) couldn't
decide between Chicago backbeats (one-and-TWO-and-three-AND-four-AND)
vs. Motown backbeats (one-TWO-three-FOUR), so he left them out... play
along with the record and let me know which you prefer.  -- AWR

Verse  (Intro  [ch]B[/ch],[ch]A[/ch],[ch]G[/ch],[ch]D[/ch])
[tab][ch]B[/ch]			[ch]F[/ch]			[ch]G[/ch]
I lost myself last night, I lost myself in you,[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]D[/ch]	   [ch]C#[/ch]
Your world is a chamber,[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]		    [ch]F[/ch]	                      [ch]G[/ch]
I walk into your room, I wish this was my tomb,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]C#[/ch]
You're pure,[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]	  [ch]F[/ch]			    [ch]G[/ch]
burning slowly, she's sleeping softly[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C#[/ch]
Your mind is a stranger,[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]		[ch]F[/ch]		  [ch]G[/ch]
If this is comfort, a mutual feeling,[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]D[/ch]	[ch]C#[/ch]
I'm falling, myself,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]F#[/ch]
In love and love,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Tell me why I am lying here with you[/tab]

Verse 2 (Same as Verse 1)

Just moving swinzy, but I am burning

It's dark but it's still so bright,

You kiss me softly, I stop and lips touch

I'm falling myself

In love in love,

(every night)

Chorus
[tab][ch]D[/ch] 		      [ch]F#[/ch]
I'm never there for you,[/tab]

Tell me why I am lying here with you every night,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]F#[/ch]
I'll never know the truth,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Tell me why I am lying here with you every night,[/tab]

I thought that you were gone, but you're still a part of me[/tab]
[tab]				[ch]D[/ch]
Your spirit still holds on, playing cards with me[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]			     [ch]G[/ch]
Emotions in this truck, made for if you dream,[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
I left my options stuck, still be thinking of you and me.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Why I am lying here with you…[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Why I am lying here with you…[/tab]


Chorus (Same as Chorus 1)

I'm never there for us,

Tell me why I am lying here with you every night,

I'll never know the truth,

Tell me why I am lying here with you every night,

I'm never there for you,

Tell me why I am lying here with you every night,

I'll never know the truth,

Why?

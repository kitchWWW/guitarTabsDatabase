[ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]    x2

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
He came dancing across the water[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
With his galleons and guns[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Looking for a new world and a place in the sun[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
And on the shore lay Montezuma[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
With it's coco leaves and pearls[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
In it's halls he often wandered with the secrets of the world[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
And his subjects gather 'round him[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Like the leaves around the trees[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Clothed in many colors for the angry gods to see[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
And the women all were beautiful[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
And the men stood straight and strong[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
He offered life and sacrifice so that others might go on[/tab]

jam on * Em  D  Am * for a few times

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Now hate was just a legend[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And war was never known[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
The people worked together and they lifted many stones[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
And they carried them across the flatlands[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
But they died along the way[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Built up with their bare hands what we still can do today[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
And I know she's living there[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And loves me to this day[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Can't remember when or how I lost my way[/tab]

jam on * Em  D  Am * for awhile...stop when it feels right

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
There was this man, he wasn't satisfied[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
He crossed all the oceans[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Am[/ch]
to find something else with his greedy hands and his[/tab]
raping heart and his mind that said war to take everything
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
He's looking down now[/tab]
And I'm sorry for every time I raped you
And I'm sorry for every time I sold you
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And I'm sorry for every time I bought you[/tab]
And I'm sorry for every time I hurt you
And I'm sorry for every time
I'm sorry for every time
I'm sorry for every time
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
He came dancing across the waters[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Cortez, Cortez[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [stop]
What a killer[/tab]

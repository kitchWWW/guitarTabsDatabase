Artist: Indigo Girls
Song: Damo
Genre: 
Key: 


I have to point out that the lyric is incomplete and probably full of mistakes...
the words in this song are barely understandable...
anyway whoever wants to send me corrections or whatever can do it on my e-mail  
(carloammatuna@libero.it)....i'd be so grateful about that...

despite the strumming, which is kinda hard,  the chords and the song in general are
pretty easy...standard tuning...no capo...

(when the indigoes play this song live there's just one guitar, fingerpicked by Emily,
a mandolin strummed by Amy, the violin and the  irish flute...)

and i do i know our violin
except what made it here
through the ports and through the hill
a whistle and a jade
they worked the fields, they worked the wheels
and sang songs of slaves
to keep the change from binding on
to keep their bodies grave

yeah Damo sings another song
all the sons of  ?
all the daughters of  ?  road
Damo sings a song of Love
Damo sings a song of love

INTRO:

| [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]E/A[/ch] | [ch]D/A[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch] | [ch]D[/ch] | [ch]Esus4[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch] |

VERSE:
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]A/C#[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Bm7[/ch]   [ch]Esus4[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]
We talked up all night and still came to no conclusion[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]A/C#[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]Bm7[/ch]   [ch]Esus4[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]
We started a fight that ended in silent confusion[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]Bm7[/ch]                        [ch]A/C#[/ch]       
And as we sat stuck you could hear the trash truck[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]Esus4[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]
Making its way through the neighborhood[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]Bm7[/ch]                                [ch]A/C#[/ch]
Picking up the thrown out different from house to house[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]Esus4[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]
We get to decide what we think is no good[/tab]

We're sculpted from youth, the chipping away makes me weary
And as for the truth it seems like we just pick a theory
The one that justifies our daily lives
And backs us with quiver and arrows
To protect openings cause when the warring begins
How quickly the wide open narrows

CHORUS:
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]A/C#[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]E/G#[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]Asus4[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
Into the smallness of our deconstruction of love[/tab]

[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
We thought it was changing, but it never was[/tab]

[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]E/A[/ch]   [ch]D/A[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]Esus4[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch] (like intro) 
It's just the same as it ever was[/tab]

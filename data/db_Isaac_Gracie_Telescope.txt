[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
It's been a while since I heard your name[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]G[/ch]
Trying to build it all, trying to build it all,[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
trying to build it all, back again[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
And I hurt myself it was all in vain[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
I couldn't build us up, couldn't build us up[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
But don't you worry it's all over now,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
it's all over[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Been looking through a telescope[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Had me thinking that we were close[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
All this time I had loved you so[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But now it's time I let you go[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Been looking through a telescope[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Had me thinking that we were close[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
All this time I had loved you so[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
But now it's time to let you go[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
To let you go[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
Staying up all night in an empty bar[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I thought I knew it all, I thought I had you down[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
But I don't know who you are[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
When I need you the most[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Yet you still so far[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
What you do with my heart[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
But don't you worry it's all over now,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
it's all over[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]
We do not exist in[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
Any other instant[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm[/ch]
Here in this dimension[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
You and I are meant to be[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I have waited lifetimes to find you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Now that you're here[/tab]

I can remind you
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Of the things you've been dreamin'[/tab]

Times two
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
I promise you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
If you just give me 24[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Man, all I need is 24 hours[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
I promise you'll want plenty more[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
You'll probably be with it forever[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
   So how does it sound[/tab]

Us on the ground
[tab]           [ch]Dm[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
Giving you my love?[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
There's no place quite like here[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Dm[/ch]
There's no better time than now[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
You gotta stay ready[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
There's no place quite like here[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Dm[/ch]
There's no better time than now[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
That's why I stay ready[/tab]

(continue playing Am G Dm F)

Tell me find your spot with the warning that I might slip
And when you climb on top that's the ultimate road trip
Ride on my like your Pac got me thinkin' it's 96'
I can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip
I'm so hip to it tourists want to come speculate
But if I stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy
And yea, it's obvious momma now probably can't stand me
I'm sure they're tired of this look that you have when you're antsy
We gon' fuck around (Mm) we gon' fuck around
And triple through triplets of babies right now
And that might break the record and no, that don't mean you're fertile
That means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection
I find myself reading old text messages when I'm bored
We find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored
I know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up
Then I wish you good luck on the seas that's inside this wall

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Come to me[/tab]

Come, come to me
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Look at what you've done to me[/tab]

You put a gun to me
[tab]                     [ch]Dm[/ch]
Then you brought the sun to me[/tab]


Shine like blood diamonds
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Learning to have patience[/tab]

Only cause you are timeless
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
The universe energy doesn't lie[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
And this chemistry is infinity at a million[/tab]

Times
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]
I wrote a million rhymes to scrabble your[/tab]

Star power
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]
Now the 24 bars, you get 24 hours[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
All that I know is right now[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Nothing's for sure but, right now[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
Gotta get yours like, right now, right now[/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
All that I know is right now[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Nothing's for sure but, right now[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
Gotta get yours like, right now, right now [/tab]


[tab][ch]Am[/ch]

But I be on my shit man
[tab][ch]G[/ch]

Is what you're given
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]
So I been tryna do it right[/tab]

[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]
We steady losin' all control[/tab]



What a life



They say
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
The truth ain't pretty[/tab]

But comin' from that pretty mouth
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
The truth is fitting[/tab]

'Cause you ain't never talkin' loud
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]

[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
If everything is dipped in gold[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Dm[/ch]
Then baby it will never grow[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]
Everything sweet ain't sugar coated[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
What a lie[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
What a life[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]

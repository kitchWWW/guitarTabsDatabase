Artist: J Roddy Walston And The Business
Song: Sally Bangs
Genre: 
Key: 


This appears to be a modernized version of a Merle Haggard song. There are just enough similarities there 
for one to assume they didn't steal the idea from him, but few enough that I thought this deserved to be
put under J Roddy Walston and The Business. 
Really fun song, hope y'all enjoy.

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]F[/ch]
Sally met a man from old Kentucky, he was rich and she got lucky[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
He said "Sally would you be my wife?"[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                           [ch]F[/ch]
Changed his will and he gave her his money, they got married and things turned funny[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
That man didn't last a second night[/tab]

An internal frame backpack
A cheap solid wood guitar
And a body that's 10 years past its prime
There are certain things that I will never throw away
There are certain things that I will never throw away

I sold a car in June
I had that car for a long time
I was leaving the United States really soon
And I always knew I would have to get rid of it some time
But still there are certain things that I will never throw away
There are just certain things that I will never throw away

I can't believe the black helicopters ever came around
If a person can exist, they must exist in the chaos
I can't believe I never got back on that plane
And I can't believe how much I like it when it rains here
And there are certain things that I'm never going to throw away
There are certain things that I'm never going to throw away

The frame is starting to wear through my backpack
And I'm looking at the big sky
But every time you look at me
I feel my future being read
Please God let there are certain things that I will never throw away
Please let there are certain things that I will never throw away

There's one of me, for one of you
There's one of me, for one of you
oh my God, oh my God
we're all going to get paid

I stood before you, my thoughts were running rampant
I had to take a moment for myself, I'm going to get through this
oh my God, oh my God
we're all going to get paid

And the direct deposit might go through on Thursday, some of us get paid on Friday
a couple of us aren't going to get paid for a while
a lot of people are upset that we don't get paid at the same time but...
it's okay, it's okay we are all going to get paid!!!

Intro
[ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch] (repeat)

One day the world will stop 

and we will all get off 

and it's even all okay 

because one time I found a wallet 

with like 907 bucks in it.

The only thing I have to offer you[/tab]

...is my bodyheat.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]

When I was two years old[/tab]

I burned my hands in a fire

I have always been really sensitive about it

you said that it never bothered you

and then one day you said you couldn't take it anymore

the thought of me touching you.

How could you say something like that to me?


I left in silence.


One day the world will stop 

and we will all get off 

and it's even all okay 

because one time I found a wallet 

with like 907 bucks in it.

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                  [ch]F[/ch]
Your voice is adrift, I can't expect it to sing to me[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
As if I was the only one[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
I'll follow you[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]C[/ch]
The leaf that's following the sun[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
When will my weight be too much for you?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
When will these ideas really be my own?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
Cause this moment keeps on moving[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
We were never meant to hold on[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
This was a scene worth waking up for[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
When I woke up, you planted me in my own pot[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]
Don't know why[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]C[/ch]
But somehow it just feels so wrong[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
When you're sad I will be lonely[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
But when you rise again I'll become the sun[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
I will shine down upon you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
As if you were the only one[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Your voice is your own, I can't protect it[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
You'll have to sing a verse no one has ever known[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
Don't be afraid ‘cause no one ever sings alone[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Your way will never be too much for me[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
Your ideas have always been your own[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
And this moment keeps on moving[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
We were never meant to hold on[/tab]

Psycho (Jack Kittel cover)


[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Can Mary fry some fish, mama?[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]
I'm as hungry as can be[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
Oh lordy, how I wish, mama[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
That you could keep the baby quiet 'cause my head is killing me[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I saw my ex again last night, mama[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]            
She was at the dance at Miller's store[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]          
She was with that Jackie White, mama[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
I killed them both and they're buried under Jenkin's sycamore[/tab]

[tab](pause)                         [ch]Bm[/ch]
You think I'm psycho don't you, mama?[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Mama, pour me a cup [/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Bm[/ch]
You think I'm psycho don't you, mama?[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]
You'd better let 'em lock me up[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Don't hand me Johnny's pup, mama[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C#m[/ch]
'Cause I might squeeze him too tight[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]
I'm havin' crazy dreams again, mama[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
So let me tell you 'bout last night[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I woke up in Johnny's room, mama[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#m[/ch]
Standing right there by his bed[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
With my hands around his throat, mama[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
Wishing both of us were dead[/tab]

[tab] (pause)                         [ch]C#m[/ch]
You think I'm psycho don't you, mama?[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]E[/ch]
I just killed Johnny's pup[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]C#m[/ch]
You think I'm psycho don't you, mama?[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
You'd better let 'em lock me up[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]
You know that little girl next door, mama[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
I believe her name was Betty Clark[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
Oh, don't tell me that she's dead, mama[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
'Cause I just saw her in the park[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
We were sitting on a bench, mama[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
Thinking up a game to play[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
Seems I was holding a wrench, mama[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
And then my mind just walked away[/tab]

[tab]                                [ch]Dm[/ch]
You think I'm psycho don't you, mama?[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
I didn't mean to break your cup[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Dm[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
You think I'm psycho don't you, mama?[/tab]
[tab] (pause)                       [ch]Dm[/ch]
Oh mama, why don't you get up?[/tab]

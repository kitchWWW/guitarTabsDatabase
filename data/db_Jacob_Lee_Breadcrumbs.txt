I've been away a little while, and it don't make sense to me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]F#[/ch]    [ch]G#m[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]
Haven't seen you in a little while, and I get a bit lonely[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]
But do you ever wonder, where I went?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G#m[/ch]                            [ch]B[/ch]
Do you ever leave the lights on at 7:30 when I would go to bed?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]F#[/ch]            [ch]G#m[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]
Do you ever wonder where I've been? for so long[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]        [ch]F#[/ch]                           [ch]G#m[/ch]
Mum and Dad, did you ever search for me?[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]B[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
I swear when they think I'm asleep, I hear you on their TV screens[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F#[/ch]                               [ch]G#m[/ch]
Keep calling out my name, cause it helps me see your face[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]B[/ch]
And if I could let you know, I'd let you know, I'm okay[/tab]

[tab] [ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]F#[/ch]                   [ch]G#m[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]
I've been gone a little while and I miss you dearly[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]F#[/ch]
Blue skies, cold nights[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G#m[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]
I saw outside and I recognize the trees[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]
But do you ever wonder where I went?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G#m[/ch]                            [ch]B[/ch]

Mum and Dad, did you ever search for me?[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]B[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]

And if I could let you know, I'd let you know, I'm okay enough[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F#[/ch]
Maybe if I pray enough[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G#m[/ch]                                       [ch]B[/ch]
He'll show you where I am; he'll guide you hand and then you'll turn up[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]
Maybe if I talk too much[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F#[/ch]
Maybe if I run amok[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G#m[/ch]                                           [ch]B[/ch]
They'll get it in their head that I'm not theirs and then they'll give me up[/tab]

I've been away a little while,   it's been a few years I think[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]F#[/ch]                   [ch]G#m[/ch]        [ch]Ab[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]

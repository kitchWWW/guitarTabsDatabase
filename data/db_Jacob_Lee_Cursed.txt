[Verse]
[tab]N.C.                      [ch]C#m[/ch]     [ch]G#m[/ch]
They tell me, it's all in my mind[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]F#m[/ch]
 They don't know they're yet to try[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G#m[/ch]
My thoughts are safer inside[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
I pray it hurts less this time[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]F#m[/ch]
They tell me, it's all in my head[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]C#m[/ch]
They don't know they have to check[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G#m[/ch]
What lies within is a mess[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]F#m[/ch]
This pill could fix it, I guess[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G#m[/ch]
Don't say, it's all in my brain[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
'Cause I can't help being this way[/tab]

[Pre-chorus]
[tab]                           [ch]G#m[/ch]
I feel the changes they've made[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C#m[/ch]
Now I don't feel the same[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]G#m[/ch]
Leave my secrets alone[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F#m[/ch]
They aren't for you to know[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G#m[/ch]
I hear the knock at my door[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C#m[/ch]
As they take me far from my home[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G#m[/ch]
They say, "It's better this way"[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
But the voices, they tell me I'm sane[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]G#m[/ch]
They think they're cleansing my veins[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
As they hook me up in this place[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]N.C.                        [ch]C#m[/ch]  [ch]G#m[/ch]
They say it starts in my soul[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
Makes its way down through my blood[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]G#m[/ch]
It's been with me since I was young[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
But they can't explain what it's from[/tab]

[Pre-chorus]
[tab]                      [ch]G#m[/ch]
I think that I've had enough[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C#m[/ch]
I don't know who I can trust[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]G#m[/ch]
Leave my secrets alone[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F#m[/ch]
They aren't for you to know[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G#m[/ch]
I hear the knock at my door[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C#m[/ch]
As they take me far from my home[/tab]

They say, "It's better this way"[/tab]

I hear the knock at my door[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]C#m[/ch]
As they make me vacate my home[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab]      [ch]G#m7[/ch]
Maybe we[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m7[/ch]
We fell apart for a reason[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G#m7[/ch]
I have to let it go[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m7[/ch]
Before I make myself sick[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G#m7[/ch]
And I feel the dark[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#m7[/ch]
In the brightest of seasons[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G#m7[/ch]
And I feel the rain[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m7[/ch]               [ch]A/B[/ch]
When the sky isn't bleeding[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]C#m/A[/ch]
And I need to know[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G#m7[/ch]
If there was another man[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#m7[/ch]
Oh, who took your hand[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Emaj9[/ch]
And gave you everything that I can[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#m/A[/ch]
And I need to know[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G#m7[/ch]
If we can start anew[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#m7[/ch]
I'll fall fast asleep[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Emaj9[/ch]
And pretend I'm not dreaming 'bout you[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]      [ch]G#m7[/ch]
Maybe we[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F#m7[/ch]
We fell in love for a reason[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G#m7[/ch]
I have to hold you close[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m7[/ch]
Before I let you slip away[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G#m7[/ch]
And I feel the pain[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F#m7[/ch]
Though my heart isn't beating[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G#m7[/ch]
And I searched myself today[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#m7[/ch]           [ch]A/B[/ch]
And I found what was missing[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]C#m/A[/ch]
I need to know[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G#m7[/ch]
If there was another man[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#m7[/ch]
Oh, who took your hand[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Emaj9[/ch]
And gave you everything that I can[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#m/A[/ch]
And I need to know[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G#m7[/ch]
If we can start anew[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#m7[/ch]
I'll fall fast asleep[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Emaj9[/ch]
And pretend I'm not dreaming 'bout you[/tab]

Oh, no no


[Bridge]
[tab]   [ch]C#m/A[/ch]
It keeps me awake[/tab]

I can explain
[tab]       [ch]G#m7[/ch]
I feel lonely lately when the birds sing your name[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#m7[/ch]
The clouds form your face[/tab]

I know myself
[tab]         [ch]Emaj9[/ch]
But this sorrow won't leave me today[/tab]


[Alternative Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]C#m/A[/ch]
I need to know[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G#m7[/ch]
If there was another soul[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#m7[/ch]
Who'd lay out their hand[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Emaj9[/ch]
And teach me to love again, oh no, no[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]C#m/A[/ch]
And I need to know[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G#m7[/ch]
If there was another heart[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#m7[/ch]
Oh, to place in my chest[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Emaj9[/ch]
And teach mine to beat again, oh[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab]              [ch]C#m/A[/ch]
And I need to know[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G#m7[/ch]
If you're coming back for me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F#m7[/ch]
Whilst I wait patiently[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Emaj9[/ch]
You said you'd grow old with me[/tab]

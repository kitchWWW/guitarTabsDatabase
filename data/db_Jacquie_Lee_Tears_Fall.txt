I had enough of you hiding us[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
How it hurt me you don't see[/tab]
Your true colors showed up a little brighter
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Why'd you keep on playing me?[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]
I put my hands back on the throttle, my love[/tab]

Into the darkness[/tab]

I can take a deep breath now that you have left[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
You didn't get the best of me[/tab]
The raw pain never goes away
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
But it gets better everyday[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
I was so wrapped up, I was blinded by love[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
Couldn't see a way to leave[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]
But I'm coming out of the darkness[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Out of the darkness[/tab]

And I don't let you see me cry[/tab]

I don't ask why[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
Why you're not here with me tonight[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
Already said goodbye![/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]
 I watched you leave[/tab]
 Couldn't breathe, couldn't cry

[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
 Then I let a tear fall, let myself feel it all[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]
 Now I know, now I know[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
 That I'm gonna survive[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
 If I let a single tear fall[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
 Drown myself in it all[/tab]

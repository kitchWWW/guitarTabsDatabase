[Verse 1]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Could be a phase, a sign of my age[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
My color's turning from lighter shade[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
And I couldn't wish these blues away[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Time's on our shoulders all over again[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
You can't change the darking today[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
You can't wish this feeling away[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Secrets will always try to escape[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I finally feel like I am breaking the grey[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Could be a sign, or the look on your face[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
As you hold me close, though feelings have changed[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
And I'm looking for answers, and your questions remain[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
On the ghost in all your yesterdays[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
You can't change the darking today[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
You can't wish this feeling away[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Secrets will always try to escape[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I finally feel like I am breaking the grey[/tab]

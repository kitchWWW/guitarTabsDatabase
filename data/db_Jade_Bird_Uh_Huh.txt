  Does she wake up, put on make-up in the bathroom[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]G/F#[/ch]
  And go to work, and stay real late and text you she'll be back soon?[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]G/F#[/ch]
  Bet her boss runs his fingers 'round her pretty blonde platinum 'do[/tab]

  I bet you never thought about that, did you?[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
  And it's none of my business[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  And I don't wanna get involved[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
  If you're thinking that she's good[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
  I think you should be told[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
  Everybody sees that you're just a little toy[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
  She's got a box full that her daddy likely bought[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
She asks you if you love her, and you nod and say "uh huh"[/tab]

  She wears short skirts so you don't ask her if you can check her phone[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]G/F#[/ch]
  Talk about the guys at work so you feel ego-central[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]G/F#[/ch]
  Like fancy cars and football teams and she like continental[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]G/F#[/ch]
  With a European accent does she speak, oh so gentle[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
  And it's none of my business[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  And I don't wanna get involved[/tab]

  God no, God no[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
  That when she's out at work, she's doing what you did to me[/tab]

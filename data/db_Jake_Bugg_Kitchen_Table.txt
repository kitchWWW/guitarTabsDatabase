[tab][ch]G5[/ch]-[ch]A5[/ch]
I wrote this song by your kitchen table[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F5[/ch]
Maybe it all seems okay[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G5[/ch]                 [ch]F5[/ch]    [ch]A5[/ch]
Sometimes it's better just to laugh than to run away[/tab]
[tab][ch]G5[/ch]-[ch]A5[/ch]
Maybe I'll leave you in the coming winter[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]F5[/ch]
And all of your dreams soon fade away[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G5[/ch]               [ch]F5[/ch]       [ch]A5[/ch] 
Sometimes it's better just to run than to play your game[/tab]

[tab]                        [ch]F5[/ch]
When we were laying down[/tab]

And you held my hand
[tab]            [ch]G5[/ch]
Amongst the opal flowers[/tab]
[tab][ch]A5[/ch]
When we sat outside[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F5[/ch]                    [ch]G5[/ch]            [ch]A5[/ch]
And I see it's over now we just grew out of love[/tab]

[tab][ch]G5[/ch]
Out from the darkness[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]A5[/ch]
Your heartlessness haunting my future[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Down on all fours [/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]A5[/ch]     
You bark bright at the descending moonlight[/tab]
 
[ch]G5[/ch]-[ch]A5[/ch]-[ch]F5[/ch]-[ch]G5[/ch]-[ch]A5[/ch]

[tab][ch]G5[/ch]-[ch]A5[/ch]
You'll be with the rest of the lonely people[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F5[/ch]
Ones who live in a cold dark place[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G5[/ch]                [ch]F5[/ch]      [ch]A5[/ch]   
Sometimes it's better just to run then to face the pain[/tab]
[tab][ch]G5[/ch]-[ch]A5[/ch] 
I've not been seeing you for some time now[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F5[/ch]
And still you choose to hold my hate[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G5[/ch]                  [ch]F5[/ch]      [ch]A5[/ch]
But after how I handled it you're hardly to blame[/tab]
                 
[tab]                 [ch]F5[/ch]
I feel you read my mind And look through my soul[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]A5[/ch]
As our love grew fainter And your face grew wetter[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F5[/ch]
And I see it's over now[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G5[/ch]-[ch]A5[/ch]
We just grew out of love[/tab]

[tab][ch]G5[/ch]
Out from the darkness[/tab]
                                                     
[tab]                               [ch]A5[/ch]
Your heartlessness haunting my future[/tab]
[tab][ch]F5[/ch]
Down on all fours [/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]G5[/ch]                [ch]A5[/ch]
You bark bright right at the descending moonlight[/tab]
 


the rest is the same structure.
for the solo just try to improvise your fingers at G string.

Thanks.

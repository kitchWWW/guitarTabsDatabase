|Verse 1|
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Those Polaroids of us[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Sittin' at the back of the bus[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Writin' our names in the dust[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
On the window, that's when we[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]C[/ch]
Were dancin' through the trees[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Our laughter on the breeze[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
I'd say I'd never let you go, and you'd say[/tab]
You'd never leave

|Pre-Chorus|
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
I need to go[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]B7[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
Things have to break before they grow[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
There's highs and lows, I know[/tab]

|Chorus|
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
But I'd come back to you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
I'd come back to you[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
If you were a thousand miles away[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
With your new friends in a new place[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
I'd still come back to you[/tab]

|Verse 2|
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
Nights spent starin' at the stars[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Your parents' liquor in my car[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
Remember that time you got caught[/tab]

Climbin' through my window?
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Days spent hidin' from the rain[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]
Watchin' movies at your parents' place[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
It feels like yesterday[/tab]

Do you feel the same?

|Pre-Chorus|
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
Did I need to go?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B7[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Did things have to break so we could grow?[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
I need you to know[/tab]

[Intro]
[tab]                  [ch]E[/ch]
It started with a whiskey neat and a heartbeat[/tab]

beating out my chest now baby
[tab]                   [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I just wanna be alone with you[/tab]

just wanna be alone with you
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
Then it wasn’t hard  to tell Cause the words just fell[/tab]

Outta my mouth no baby
[tab]                  [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I just wanna be alone with you[/tab]

just wanna be alone with you


[Verse]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Tic tac toe, got ‘em three in a row[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Got my head, got my heart, and you got my soul[/tab]
[tab][ch]Asus2[/ch]                                   [ch]Asus2[/ch]
The drinks got nothing to do with it ..Well….[/tab]

Maybe just a little bit
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
Wasn’t on the rocks but it broke the ice[/tab]

Made me think that I should just roll the dice
[tab]      [ch]Asus2[/ch]
And ask you for a dance or two[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]Bsus4[/ch]     [ch]Asus2[/ch]
Couple drinks and then the night just flew by…[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                     [ch]E[/ch]
It started with a whiskey neat and a heartbeat[/tab]

beating out my chest now baby
[tab]                   [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I just wanna be alone with you[/tab]

just wanna be alone with you
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
An it wasn’t hard  to tell Cause the words just fell[/tab]

Outta my mouth no baby
[tab]                  [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I just wanna be alone with you[/tab]

just wanna be alone with you


[Interlude]
[tab]                  [ch]E[/ch]
It started with a whis..key… neat[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Asus2[/ch]
Started with you me[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]
It started with a whiskey neat[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Asus2[/ch]
Started with you and me[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Vertigo from the afterglow[/tab]

Maybe from the liquor baby I don’t know
[tab][ch]Asus2[/ch]
Not a soul out on these streets[/tab]
[tab][ch]Asus2[/ch]
Baby just you and me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
Playing love charades as the evening fades[/tab]

Lips wanna whisper what our bodies say
[tab][ch]Asus2[/ch]
You ask me in for a minute or two[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]Bsus4[/ch]    [ch]Asus2[/ch]
Couple kisses and then the night just flew by….[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                     [ch]E[/ch]
It started with a whiskey neat and a heartbeat[/tab]

beating out my chest now baby
[tab]                   [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I just wanna be alone with you[/tab]

just wanna be alone with you
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
An it wasn’t hard  to tell Cause the words just fell[/tab]

Outta my mouth no baby
[tab]                  [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I just wanna be alone with you[/tab]

just wanna be alone with you

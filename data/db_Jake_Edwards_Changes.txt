[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
I never had a reason[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]E[/ch]
Or something to believe in[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
There was nothing I wanted to fight for[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Getting up never really felt right before[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Now I'm telling you I've found something[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]
Can't tell me that I've got nothing[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
Now I have a reason to get out of bed[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Stop hearing those voices inside my head[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Oh... I'm gonna[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
Wake up and break down all the barriers[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
That I've put aside and didn't conquer[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
When I was down and out and done[/tab]

Never thought I was gonna be someone
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
Gotta chase the lights and microphones[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]
Won't give it up till I'm well known[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Gotta chase these daydreams down[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
And keep both feet on the ground[/tab]

[ch]E[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
I know I've had some troubles[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]
Thinkin' bout my struggles[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
They were worth the time I wasted[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And every hour I waited[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
I know the road is unclear[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]E[/ch]
Forget about your fear[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
Of falling down and never living[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Floor is hard not unforgiving[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Oh... I'm gonna[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
Wake up and break down all the barriers[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
That I've put aside and didn't conquer[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
When I was down and out and done[/tab]

Never thought I was gonna be someone
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]

[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Gotta chase these daydreams down[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
And keep both feet on the ground[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
It's not all[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
Down to dreaming[/tab]
       [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]
When my fingers lose all feeling[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Won't stop searching for my way[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]
I don't care what's in my way don't care[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
If it takes all day won't care[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]
Watch you have to say I'll make it[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Cuz I'm gonna[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
Wake up and break down all the barriers[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]G[/ch]
That I've put aside and didn't conquer[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch] 

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
I wrote this song for you,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]Am[/ch]
I couldn't think of nothing else to do,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
To let you know,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
You're the only place my heart wants to go,[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
And if you think,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]Am[/ch]
Maybe I've just had too much to drink,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
You wouldn't be wrong,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
But I would still write this song,  [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah I would still write you a song...[/tab]

[Mini-Instrumental]
[ch]G[/ch]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
I couldn't think of words to say, [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
To let you know just how much, [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
That I think about you, night and day,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
And I couldn't let these feelings get away. [/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch] 
It's cheesy, it's obscene,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
But you know what I mean,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
When I say, I couldn't go another day,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Without your perfect, lazy, drawn out Mondays.[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
When I swore to you,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
I could never love another just like I do,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
It's a cliché, cliché,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
I'd never throw away.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And when we're old,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]  
And both our hands are cold,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
I'll find you in the night and make you shiver endlessly...[/tab]

[Mini-Instrumental 2]
[ch]G[/ch]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
I wrote this song for you,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
I couldn't think of nothing else to do,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               
To let you know,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                              [ch]C[/ch]
You're the only place my heart wants to grow,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
You're the only place I know.[/tab]

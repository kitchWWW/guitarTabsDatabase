[Verse 1]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
I miss you[/tab]
Your name's still on my coffee cup
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]
I miss you[/tab]
The way you chose the films we watched
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
I miss you, babe[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
If only I had told you that before[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Maybe I would never have to miss you[/tab]
Singing by the kitchen sink
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]
I miss you[/tab]
Not knowing I was listening
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
I miss you, babe[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]D[/ch]
You embody everything that I am not[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
And, now, I'm just somebody you forgot[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I wish it was a year ago[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I wish that I could hold you close[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
Now I'm driving past your house, I know[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
The lights are on, you're not alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I wonder if you're making eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I wonder if he loves you like[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
The way you said that only I could do[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
I wish that I could tell you that I miss you[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I miss you[/tab]
The way you left my car a mess
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]
I miss you[/tab]
The way you took up half the bed
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
That empty space[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]D[/ch]
You remind me of the things that I am not[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]Em[/ch]
And, now, I'm just somebody you forgot[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]D/F#[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G/B[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]D/F#[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]G/B[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
Oh, and I can't help myself[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Oh-oh, no[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I wish it was a year ago[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I wish that I could hold you close[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
Now I'm driving past your house, I know[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
The lights are on, you're not alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I wonder if you're making eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I wonder if he loves you like[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
The way you said that only I could do[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]D/F#[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G/B[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
I wish that I could tell you that I miss you, oh-ohh[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]D/F#[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G/B[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
I wish that I could tell you that I miss you, oh, I-I-I-I[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I wish it was a year ago[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I wish that I could hold you close[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
The way you said that only I could do[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
I wish that I could tell you that I miss you[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
I’m faded, I’m faded, [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
I’m not sure if I can make it,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
Ohhhhhh[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
but don’t you cry for me,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
  Honey I’m not worth it, oh,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  Honey I’m not worth it, oh,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  Honey I’m not worth it,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Don’t you cry for me.[/tab]

[Rap]
I’m skipping through the days to come home,
A million conversations, autopilot, steer, flow,
I’m on my one-man mission, eyes down, take note;
I’ve never liked you, stay away from me don’t lock the boat
This is the greatest gift from everything I've ever hated,
From all this figuring this life’s shit that's got me jaded
Faded all the time the doubting got me underrated,
This is my mechanism, moving forward, isolated,
Belated superficial gestures of a phony type,
I come alive when I’m incarcerated late at night,
I wish that I could leave this soul destruction every night,
That I could regress in an able-bodied prototype,
If that made sense I’d leave him here to handle lesser business,
I’m immaterial but I still got things on a wish list,
This is desire; can’t you hear it in my C+ English?
I’d love the finer things but that’s not being realistic, ballistic,
Everybody goes when I’m singing, I’m sick of singing pain
So I’m free, broken, winging,
Coming out my heart purer than the way I’m living,
Maybe I’ll see you, or maybe I’ll just give in.

[Verse]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
Yeah, it’s just too much now that I’m all grown up,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
I’ve been dragged through the dirt, now I should be blowing up,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]
Still I’m blowing, still I’m blowing,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
And I don’t know where the hell I should be going,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]    
I guess it’s live like this ‘til my mind goes snap,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch] 
No love, no drug could ever fill this gap,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
Yeah I live for the high until it all floods back,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
Like the tears of the years that I can’t get back.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
I’m faded, I’m faded, [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
I’m not sure if I can make it,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
Ohhhhhh[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
but don’t you cry for me,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
  Honey I’m not worth it, oh,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
  Honey I’m not worth it, oh,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  Honey I’m not worth it,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Don’t you cry for me.[/tab]

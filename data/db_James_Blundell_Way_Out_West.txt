G(8)
Way out west where the rain don't fall, 
G(8)
got a job with the company drilling for oil
        Dsus2(8)                                     G(8)
Just to make some change, living and a`working on the land


[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I quit my job and I left my wife[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Headed out west for a brand new life[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch]
Just to get away. Living and a`working on the land[/tab]


[Chorus]
       C(3)  C/B(1)  Am(4)     G(8)
What a change it's been, from working that nine to five [Riff 1]
       C(3)  C/B(1) Am(4)
How strange it's been, 
D(8)
at last I get the feeling that I'm really alive [Riff 2]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]D[/ch]
I just put my best friend back through hell again[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
When I asked him if you had been untrue[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
He said, "How can you ask such a thankless task[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
From a man who's been a brother to both of you?"[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
He put his hand on me and said tenderly,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
"I will tell you if you give this a try[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Call her up yourself and, if something's left[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
I hope she loves you enough to tell a lie"[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
"If she loves you enough to tell a lie[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
Then, perhaps all of her love hasn't died[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
That's my reply to you and I swear it's true[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
I hope she loves you enough to tell a lie"[/tab]

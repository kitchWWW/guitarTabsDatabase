[ch]D[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
Thanks for droppin' by but you don't need to see[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
What I do when I get sick and tired of me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Come in for a while since you're already here[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
But don't expect a smile and look out for all the tears[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
You 'bout to get yourself a lesson in depression[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
From the king of his profession[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
If you choose to stay I could help you lose your way[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
There isn't any question[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
All you need to know is there's no place to go[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
But back to where you've been, time and time again[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
You see the only rule to pass in this school[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
There's nothing left to learn, past the point of no return[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
You 'bout to get yourself a lesson in depression[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
From the king of his profession[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
If you choose to stay I could help you lose your way[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
There isn't any question[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
She took all that she could stand[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Tired of offering up her love like a sacrificial lamb[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
She packed up everything she had[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
In a two wheel suitcase and a worn out shoulder bag[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]   
Bought a cup of caffeine and some gasoline[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
Before the sun came up[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]
Pointed her truck south and blew that town[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                     
In a big old cloud of dust[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
The rubber she left when she popped that clutch[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Is all she'll leave behind[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
While he's waking up and washing the taste of whiskey from his mouth[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
I bet she's halfway to Houston by now.[/tab]


[tab][ch]A[/ch]           [ch]Bm[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
She wipes her teardrop away[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                     
She wishes that he would, but she knows he'll never change[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]       [ch]Bm[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
She took all the love she ever felt for him[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]                           
and threw it out the window with everything that might have been[/tab]


[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]   
Bought a cup of caffeine and some gasoline[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
Before the sun came up[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]

[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
While he's waking up and washing the taste of whiskey from his mouth[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
I bet she's halfway to Houston by now.[/tab]


[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
First she tried to close her eyes [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
and tried to deny the truth[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]Bm[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch] 
Cause she felt something die within her and then...[/tab]



[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]   
Bought a cup of caffeine and some gasoline[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
Before the sun came up[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]

[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Is all she'll leave behind[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
I bet she's halfway to Houston by now.[/tab]



[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
His cloudy mind don't realize[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
She finally just walked out.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
I bet she's pulling in to Houston[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
By now.[/tab]

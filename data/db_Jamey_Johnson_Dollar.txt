[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Daddy hugs his little man  [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
says son I’ve got to go[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
and he pulls out of the drive and disappears[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
as they walk back in the house[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
the young boy asks his mama[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
where does daddy go when he leaves here[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch] 
mama tells her little man[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
your daddy’s got a job[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
and when he goes to work they pay him for his time [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]               
well the young boy gets to thinking [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
and he heads up to his bedroom [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
and comes running back with a quarter and four dimes [/tab]


chorus: 

[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
and says mama how much time will this buy me [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
is it enough to take me fishing or throw a football in the street[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
if I’m a little short then how much more does daddy need[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch] 
to spend some time with me[/tab]

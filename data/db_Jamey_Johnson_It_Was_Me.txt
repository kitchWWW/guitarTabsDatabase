[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
The first time I met her, she walked right up to me,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
An' said: "You're who I've wanted to find."[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
There was a man she had seen in her dreams,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
An' it was me.[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
She said: "I can't believe it 'cause I've never been in here,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
"An' I've passed this place so many times."[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
It was her night to find destiny,[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
An' it was me.[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
An' we danced every song that they played,[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
An' talked until closin' time.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]
The closer I held her,[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
The more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine.[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Then I saw a reflection of someone unfamiliar[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Lookin' back when I looked in her eyes.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
The happiest man I'd ever seen,[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
An' it was me.[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
An' we danced every song that they played,[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
An' talked until closin' time.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
The closer I held her,[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
The more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine.[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
She wasn't lookin', an' I wasn't lookin':[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Ain't it funny that that's when love is found.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
She still calls it her lucky night:[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                           [ch]A[/ch]
Yeah, someone was lucky, she's right,[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
But it was me.[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Ah, it was me.[/tab]

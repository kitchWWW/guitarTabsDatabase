Intro [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                         
Daddy's bourbon breathe was strong as gasoline,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch] 
and it seemed to fuel the rage he had inside. [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
He'd come home just burning, mad, drunk, and mean, [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]              
raising hell on a Saturday night. [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]        
Mom would lock us up in her bedroom, [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
he'd be lying in the hallway on our way to sunday school.[/tab]

(Chorus)

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]                             
They Both in their own ways became my saving grace. [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]         
Daddy passed out with his demons, momma passed the offering plate. [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
And she'd cry out to heaven protect this son of mine, [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]    
while daddy kept the devil off my back by taking up his time.[/tab]


[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Mom said nobody's perfect as we walked in the church[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
to ask the good lord to forgive him again. [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
I still recall that sermon I hung on every word That's when [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
I learned just exactly what father really meant. [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
And the angels and the people gathered round. [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
I was standing in that water when the preacher laid me down.[/tab]

Repeat Chorus and add at the end

Daddy kept the devil off my back by taking up his time.

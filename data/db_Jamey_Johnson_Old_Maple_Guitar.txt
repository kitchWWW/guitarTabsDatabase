[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
I got my first guitar when I turned 13[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Daddy said here ya go son, now you can play like me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
I got that honkytonk fever deep down in my bones[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch] 
From that old maple guitar and a good country song[/tab]


I remember the dry heat and the Mojave sand
Just me and that guitar and some old marine friends
And about the only thing that got us through 29 Palms
Was an old maple guitar and some good country songs


Chorus:
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Lord that old maple guitar gots wood grains of gold[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch] 
And that good country music just pours from your soul[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch] 
And it'll echo in the air way till god calls us home[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
With an old maple guitar and a good country song[/tab]



"Take it up boys"   Change key to E

[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]
I was stranded in Birmingham and down on my luck[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]
Cause my wife took my money and then a bank took my truck[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
Oh but theres two things I still have that they better leave alone[/tab]

Thats that old maple guitar and these good country songs


Chorus:
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]

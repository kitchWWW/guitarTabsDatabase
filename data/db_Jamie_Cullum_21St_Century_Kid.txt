 LYRICS
**********
There's maybe a way I can tell you
Cos with everyday things continue
To get more compromised
So who will fantasise
A new generation politicised

When things are done in our own name
Are we as much to blame
Now it's become clear to me
But only lately
And the ground is removed underneath

Shout it from the brink
You're louder than you think

21st Century kid
Surrounded by illusion and confusion
So maybe if you're holding out for the truth now
Could it be the greatest weapon?
Could it be the greatest weapon?
Your weapon

Nothing is certain except a memory
And that's soon washed away by a low sea
Now sit yourself down my one
And see what you become
Ignoring a smouldering gun

The white dove's flown
D'ya think we're on our own

21st Century kid
Surrounded by illusion and confusion
So maybe if you're holding out for the truth now
Could it be the greatest weapon?

21st Century kid
Surrounded by illusion and confusion
So maybe if you're holding out for the truth now
Could it be the greatest weapon?
Could it be the greatest weapon?
Your weapon

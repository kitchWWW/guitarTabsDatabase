[Intro]
[ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Gm[/ch]
[ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Gm[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]Gm[/ch]
 Maybe I've been ruining my life[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]Gm[/ch]
 Shifting the blame and I don’t know why[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
The common theme, the misery[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Gm[/ch]
Ignore the fact that it's been staring back at me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]Gm[/ch]
 It’s me, the problem is me[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]Eb[/ch]
So where's my applause[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]         [ch]Eb[/ch]
For finding my flaws?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                  [ch]Fm[/ch]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I try?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                  [ch]Fm[/ch]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]
Didn't I, didn't I, didn’t I, didn’t I try?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                    [ch]Fm[/ch]
But I've been playing the victim[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Eb[/ch]
Now they don’t listen to me anymore[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                  [ch]Fm[/ch]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]
But didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn’t I try?[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Gm[/ch]
 Walking bare feet on the broken glass[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]Gm[/ch]
 Never trying to amend the past[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
And everyone they hold their tongue[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Gm[/ch]
In case I'm overthinking and I take it wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]Gm[/ch]
 It's me, it's always been me[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]Eb[/ch]
So where's my applause[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]         [ch]Eb[/ch]
For finding my flaws?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                  [ch]Fm[/ch]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I try?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                  [ch]Fm[/ch]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]
Didn't I, didn't I, didn’t I, didn’t I try?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                    [ch]Fm[/ch]
But I've been playing the victim[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Eb[/ch]
Now they don’t listen to me anymore[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                  [ch]Fm[/ch]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]
But didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn’t I try?[/tab]

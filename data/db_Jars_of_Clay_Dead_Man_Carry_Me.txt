(Verse 1)
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                               [ch]Ab[/ch]
January 1, I've got a lot of things on my mind[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                                    [ch]Ab[/ch]
I'm looking at my body through a new spy satellite[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                                           [ch]Ab[/ch]
Try to lift a finger, but I don't think I can make the call[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                                           [ch]Ab[/ch]
So tell me if I move, 'cause I don't feel anything at all[/tab]

(Chorus)
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch] 
So Carry Me, I'm just a dead man[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]B[/ch]
Lying on the carpet can't find a heartbeat[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]             
Make me breathe, I want to be a new man[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]B[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]
Tired of the old one out with the old plan[/tab]

(Verse 2)
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                                 [ch]Ab[/ch]
I woke up from a dream about an empty funeral[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                                                       [ch]Ab[/ch]
But is was better than the party full of people I don't really know[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                                                        [ch]Ab[/ch]       
They've got hearts to break and burn dirty hands to feel the earth[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                                                   [ch]Ab[/ch]
There's something in my veins, but I can't seem to make it work... won't work[/tab]

(Bridge)
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Can you find a beat inside of me?[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
Any pulse? Getting worse?[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D2[/ch]                 [ch]D2[/ch]
Any pulse? Getting worse?[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]D2[/ch]
Inside of me, can you find a beat?[/tab]

 I woke up in the morning and all the bells were ringing
 My eyes could see the Glory, baby - could hear the song they're singing

 You only get to see the Light just one time in your life

 Oh, Black Magic that blows your mind away
 takes you somewhere that you wanna stay
 you only get to stay one day
 That cold Black Magic

 Is there anything more wretched than to just have caught one sight?
 The eyes that saw the Glory have been, have been blinded by the light

 And it's the true believers that crash & burn
 but there ain't no way I'm ever gonna learn

 Black Magic that blows your mind away
 takes you somewhere that you wanna stay
 you only get to stay one day
 That cold Black Magic

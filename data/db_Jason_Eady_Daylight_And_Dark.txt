VERSE:
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Well, it's eight o'clock in the morning[/tab]

And my head is screaming at me
[tab]                                       [ch]C[/ch]
And I try to turn it down but it won't go[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
My clothes, they smell like habits[/tab]

And my skin like yesterday
[tab]                                          [ch]D[/ch]
And I pray to god my state of mind don't show[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
So I step out of bed trying not to make a sound[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
So this stranger here beside me doesn't know[/tab]


CHORUS:
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
And there ain't no conversation [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
Between the daylight and the dark[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
It's a worn-out situation [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
When you don't know where you are[/tab]


VERSE:
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Well, my phone won't stop ringing[/tab]

Try to pull myself together
[tab]                                       [ch]C[/ch]
But I watch it on the table and let it go[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
I hear the normal people talking[/tab]

Walking right outside my window
[tab]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
And I wonder what they know that I don't[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Are they just surviving [/tab]

After all this time
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
And just going through the motions that I won't[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
When you don't know where you are[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
And you can't quite find the middle [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
But you're somewhere in between[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
And the hardest part of all [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
Is that you don't know what that means[/tab]


VERSE:
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Well I locked the door behind me[/tab]

[tab]                                       [ch]C[/ch]
But I need to get outside to clear my head[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
My hands are in my pocket[/tab]

And my eyes are on the ground
[tab]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
And I'm trying hard to watch my every step[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
But one foot then the other[/tab]

Then it's one look then another
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Then I take all the attention I can get[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]/[ch]Cm[/ch] [x 3 3 2 1 0]
You. You were a friend. You were a friend of mine[/tab]
[tab]					     [ch]Gm[/ch]	   [ch]C[/ch]
I let you spend the night. You see it was my fault[/tab]
[tab]		 [ch]F[/ch]
Of course it was mine.[/tab]


[tab][ch]F[/ch]/[ch]Cm[/ch]
I'm,    too hard at work[/tab]

Have you ever heard of anything so absurd
[tab]	      [ch]Gm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
Ever in your life?[/tab]
[tab]			   [ch]F[/ch]
I'm sorry for wasting your time[/tab]


[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]			[ch]Dm7[/ch] [5 5 7 6 6 5]
Who am I to say this situation isn't great?[/tab]
[tab]	         [ch]Am[/ch]
When it's my job to make the most of it[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Cm[/ch]				         [ch]Gm[/ch]
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]B#m[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
Not that easy-e-e.[/tab]


[tab][ch]F[/ch]/[ch]Cm[/ch]
Hey, what's that you say?[/tab]

You're not blaming me for anything well that's great but
[tab]		   [ch]Gm[/ch] 
I don't break that eeeasy[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
Does it fade away?[/tab]


[tab]	        [ch]F[/ch]/[ch]Cm[/ch]
So that's why I'm,   I'm apologizing now[/tab]

For telling you I thought that we could make it
[tab]		 [ch]Gm[/ch]
I just don't get enough[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]C[/ch]		      [ch]F[/ch]
To believe that we've both changed.[/tab]


[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]			      [ch]Dm7[/ch]
See, who am I to say this situation isn't great?[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]Am[/ch]
It is my time to make the most of it[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Cm[/ch]				         [ch]Gm[/ch]
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]B#m[/ch]		      [ch]F[/ch]		[ch]C[/ch]
Not that easy, no-o no-o no no-o-o[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]			         [ch]Dm7[/ch]
If all along the fault is up for grabs why can't you have it?[/tab]
[tab]	  [ch]Am[/ch]
If it's for sale what is your offer?[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cm[/ch]			    [ch]Gm[/ch]
I will sell it for no less than what I bought it for[/tab]
[tab][ch]B#m[/ch]		   [ch]F[/ch]	        [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
Pay no more than absolutely zero-ooo.[/tab]


[tab]         [ch]Gm[/ch]			    [ch]C[/ch]
Well neither one of us deserves the blame[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]F[/ch]	   [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
Because opportunities moved us away[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]Gm[/ch]			       [ch]C[/ch]
And it's not an easy thing to learn to play[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]			[ch]A[/ch]		  [ch]Dm[/ch]
A game that's made for two that's you and me[/tab]
[tab]		            [ch]B#m[/ch]
The rules remain a mystery[/tab]
[tab]	       [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
See how it's easy?[/tab]


[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]			      [ch]Dm7[/ch]
See, who am I to say this situation isn't great?[/tab]
[tab]	        [ch]Am[/ch]
Well it's our time to make the most of it[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cm[/ch]				 [ch]Gm[/ch]
How could we ever know that this would happen to mee[/tab]
[tab][ch]B#m[/ch]		[ch]F[/ch]		[ch]C[/ch]
Not that easy, no-o no-o oh-oh-oh-oh[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]			[ch]Dm7[/ch]
When all along the fault is up for grabs and there you have it[/tab]
[tab]	        [ch]Am[/ch]
Well it's for sale go make your offer[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cm[/ch]			     [ch]Gm[/ch]
Well I sell it for no less than what I bought it for[/tab]
[tab][ch]B#m[/ch]		   [ch]F[/ch]	       [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
Pay no more than absolutely zero-oooo-ooo.[/tab]

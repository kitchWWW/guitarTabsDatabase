[tab][ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
What to get the girl who has everything[/tab]
All I want for Christmas is you
Here's my list
I checked it twice
Wasnt good, wasn't bad
I was naughty and nice
Had my eye on you all year long
And now I know for sure
I wouldnt even have to try you on
No need for gift returns

Chorus:

[tab][ch]C[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
It's gonna be a cold winter[/tab]
But I won't need the heat to keep me warm
As long as you wrap yourself around me on Christmas morn
Whether it's now or later
As long as it's before you go
Love is always in your favour
And now you know that

[tab][ch]C[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
All I want for Christmas[/tab]
Is..


[tab][ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
Sweet like a candy cane[/tab]
Hanging from the tree
I will stripe you red and green
When you hit me like a sugar rush
No need for the other stuff this season you're all that i need
They say wishing for you is like wishing for snow in Californina
But you know that I could prove them all wrong
Cause my love is true, I simply adore you


Chorus:
[tab][ch]C[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
It's gonna be a cold winter[/tab]
But I won't need the heat to keep me warm
As long as you wrap yourself around me on Christmas morn
Whether it's now or later
As long as it's before you go
Love is always in your favour
And now you know that
All I want for Christmas
Is..


[tab][ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
Can't say that I've been good all year[/tab]
But I've been makin resolutions to get you here
And if it means being better than whatever
No sweat
Well I bet my halls
That I deck for the cause
And Santa Clause
He knows what my intentions are
Even dismissing mistle toes so I can get to know you
First of all singing Oh my God
You're the reason that I decorate my yard

[tab][ch]C[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
It's gonna be a cold winter[/tab]
But I don't need the heat to keep me warm
As long as you wrap yourself around me on Christmas morn
Whether it's now or later
Got to tell you before you go
That love is always in your favour
And now you know that
All I want for Christmas
All I want for Christmas
.. Is us.

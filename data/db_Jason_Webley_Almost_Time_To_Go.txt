[Intro]
[ch]C7[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
[ch]C7[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]Dm[/ch]
Guess you never really stuck around,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]      [ch]C7[/ch]
All that long anywhere.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                           [ch]Dm[/ch]
I guess I should have known that you'd skip town.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bb[/ch]               [ch]C7[/ch]
You always did, catch me unawares.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Looking now at your debris,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]                                [ch]Bb[/ch]
These trails of paper strewn across the floor.[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C7[/ch]
Towards an open door.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
Look at all you've gathered, all you own,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Hold it in your hand,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C7[/ch]
Does it weigh more than a single feather?[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
If the things you feel outsmart the things you know,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
It's almost time, it's almost time to go.[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
I don't know if you struggled at the end.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bb[/ch]                     [ch]C7[/ch]
I know at times, you fought like hell.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
I know that sleep was never quite your friend.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bb[/ch]                  [ch]C7[/ch]
I hope that now, you're resting well.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Old band names and alma maters,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
A patchwork quilt of people you have been,[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C7[/ch]
Tattooed on your skin.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
Look at all you've gathered, all you own,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Hold it in your hand,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C7[/ch]
Does it weigh more than a single feather?[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
If the things you feel outsmart the things you know,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]            
It's almost time, it's almost time to-.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
Think of people, places you have known,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Sculpted out of sand.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C7[/ch]
The tide's coming in and we're going nowhere.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
If your feet are still in shoes that they've outgrown,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
It's almost time, it's almost time to-[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]C7[/ch]                   [ch]Dm[/ch]
Think of seed you've scattered and you've sown,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
All out of your hands,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C7[/ch]
Lost in the wind like a little feather,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
And the things you feel outsmart the things you know.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]C7[/ch]
It's almost time, it's almost time, it's almost time, it's almost time,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]C7[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
it's almost time, it's almost time to go.[/tab]

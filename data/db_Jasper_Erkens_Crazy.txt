COMPLETE SONG:

Intro x 4

Verse
I remember when
I remember I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place.
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much space

And when you're out there
Without care, Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
No, I just knew too much

Chorus
And does that make me crazy
Does that make me crazy
Does that make me crazy
Possibly

Bridge
And I hope that you were having, the time of your life
But think twice
that's my only advice

Ooh

Verse
Come on now, who do you
who do you, who do you, who DO YOU think you are,
Ha ha ha bless your soul
You really think YOU’RE in control

Chorus
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

Bridge
My heroes had the heart to Lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember, is thinking, I wanna be like them.

Ooh

Verse
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I’ve come
And I can die when I'm done

Chorus
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

Chorus (quiet)
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

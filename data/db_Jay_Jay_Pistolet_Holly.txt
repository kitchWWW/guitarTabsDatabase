Holly was the kind of girl the cameras liked[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]                                                           [ch]Am[/ch]
She could play the part of poet that's kept behind the mic[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                                                                            [ch]Am[/ch]
And whilst i've always dreamed of making it in Hollywood[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]                                                                [ch]Am[/ch]
I know that if she'd had a second chance then Holly could[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                          [ch]C[/ch]
And i did all that i could to help[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                                 [ch]C[/ch]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                                            [ch]Am[/ch]
By the time that she was twenty she had driven insane[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]                                                                    [ch]Am[/ch]
On her way back out she crashed straight into crack cocaine[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]C[/ch]                                              [ch]Am[/ch]
And whilst i'd never once condemed i did not agree[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]                                                [ch]Am[/ch]
That's why i think Holly fell to fall in love with me[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                          [ch]C[/ch]
But i did all that i could to help[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                                [ch]C[/ch]
Yeah i've done all that i can to help[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]
I layed down my anchor[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]
and i said let's make a stand[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause i'm leaving only when [/tab]

[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]                                                                     [ch]Am[/ch]
She cleaned her act up burnt her shackles and chains[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]                                                            [ch]Am[/ch]
And she rid herself of men who used their fists for their brains[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]                                                             [ch]Am[/ch]
And she cotched upon a couch within the neighbors' space[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]                                                       [ch]Am[/ch]
Til she'd saved enough to pay the lease on her own place[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                          [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
She used to brush past all the students of art[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C[/ch]                                                     [ch]Am[/ch]
She said they're masters of their craft but i am far too smart[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]                                           [ch]Am[/ch]
And i've always fancied studying humanitites[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                                                         [ch]Am[/ch]
And she passed with first-class honours in philosophy[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                          [ch]C[/ch]
But i did all that i could to help[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]
I layed down my anchor[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause i'm leaving only when [/tab]

A car was being naughty down a one-way street[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]                                                                       [ch]Am[/ch]
And it crushed her brittle bones right from her head to her feet[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]                                                [ch]Am[/ch]
And as i knelt over her body and i prayed to god[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]                                                [ch]Am[/ch]
I lost faith in everything that ever has been oh[/tab]

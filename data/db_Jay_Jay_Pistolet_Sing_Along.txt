VERSE:
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
Well I wrote some words for a melody[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
About a girl and subject equally as sweet[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
& I played them out on the road[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
But I knew 'bout people's faces, how they'd cope[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
I think I'm gonna keep my eyelids closed[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, I don't mind a town that's gonna keep me on my toes[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
But if I do not have a future then I think it should let me know[/tab]


CHORUS:
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
Cos I wrote all these songs[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]F#[/ch]
& if I've been going wrong[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
I won't hold my breath to see you sing along[/tab]



Well I've been met by great acclaim
But I worry that my songs all sound the same
So I'll start a band, create a brand
And I guarantee my fan base will expand
But I'd like to see how long it all withstands

Oh, I don't want to seem like a thorn in your side
And if it all withers and dies then at least I know I tried


Cos I wrote all these songs
& if I've been going wrong
I won't hold my breath to see you sing along

Yes I wrote all these songs 
& if I've been going wrong
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
I won't hold my breath to see you sing along[/tab]

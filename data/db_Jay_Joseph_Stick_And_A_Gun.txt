[Verse 1]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]
I keep running circles with you[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm[/ch]
Never feeling special, itʼs true[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
But things are looking up[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Yeah, when I keep looking up[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]
I never had these problems looking back[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Dm[/ch]
But what kills me is something I never had[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
But things are looking up[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Yeah, when I keep looking up[/tab]

Yeah


[Pre-Chorus]
N.C
I've been looking for a soft escape
N.C.
Just something with an echo of that flipping page
N.C.
And I could choose wisely, take it and run
N.C.
But you, you got questions 'bout a stick and a gun


[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]
Iʼve been looking left and right[/tab]

Weʼve got some problems
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Take this line, call me up and say itʼs abuse[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
'Cause we write to see how we solve 'em[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
We got nothing but a stick and a gun[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]                 [ch]F[/ch]
Iʼve been asking questions, you just stayed[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
Never looking for the answerʼs your mistake[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Am[/ch]
'Cause I've been choking up[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
When I keep looking up[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
Thereʼs a lotta issues, throw away the misuse[/tab]
               N.C.
Guess I'm just S.O.L. again
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
Overlook the miscues, throw away the tissues[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
Always liked to see you as a friend[/tab]

And Iʼll keep looking up


[Pre-Chorus]

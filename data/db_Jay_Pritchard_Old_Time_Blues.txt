I met you on the weekend in my dreams[/tab]
You told me you were free, oh so free
I drank all my whiskey and your wine
You kissed oh you kissed me for my time

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
But I’m a cold lover of the old time blues[/tab]

And waiting, waiting, waiting, just waiting for you[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
You cut me loose without my noose to hang[/tab]
On my feet on which I finally stand
Try to run, try to hide, just you try it I'll make you mine

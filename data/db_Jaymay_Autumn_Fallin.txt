[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
Autumn falling from trees[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
The snow is up to our knees[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
I let you borrow my keys[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
To sleep in my room[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
You threw away my shoe[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
I brought you to central park zoo[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
Then I drew your eyes very blue[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
And I stuck them on the fridge[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch] 
And I believe it was you[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
Who I wanted to be walking next to[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
And I believe we were friends[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
and I believe we will be again[/tab]

So you sighed and swept your broom
Under the wintery moon
Well I called up this afternoon
Your words were "Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye" 

And I believe it was you
Who I wanted to be talking to
And I believe we were friends
And I believe we will be again

[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
Oh, if I knock on your door would you let me in?[/tab]
[tab][ch]F7[/ch]     [ch]Bb[/ch]       [ch]G7[/ch]
Do you know any more than I do?[/tab]

Keep on wonderin' about you
Even if you don't want me to
The girl you once knew
Is the person we are

And I believe it was you
Who I wanted to be walking next to
And I believe we were friends
And I believe we will be again

Ends on C

Hope you enjoy

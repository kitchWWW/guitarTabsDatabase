[Verse 1]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
There's a time to laugh and time to cry[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]
A time to live and a time to die[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
A time to get and too much time to lose[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
There's a time to keep and give away[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]
A time to love, a time to hate[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
The pieces to this puzzle aren't smooth[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
Sometimes it seems to go like that[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]  
Every one step forward Takes you two steps back[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
For every valley in your life[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
For every mountain that you climb[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
For every season, every time, there's a purpose[/tab]
                                                              
For every giant that you face,
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
For every battle, every race[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
For Every minute, every day there's a purpose[/tab]

[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]

[Verse 2]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
There's a time when time is all you need[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]
A desperate try to make ends meet[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
A plan that never goes the way it should[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
And It's a battle just to understand[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
A bigger picture, a greater plan[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
But all things work together for our good[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
Sometimes it seems to go like that[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
Funny how it all works out When you look back[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
For every valley in your life[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
For every mountain that you climb[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
For every season, every time, there's a purpose[/tab]
                                                              
For every giant that you face,
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
For every battle, every race[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
There's a purpose   oh.[/tab]

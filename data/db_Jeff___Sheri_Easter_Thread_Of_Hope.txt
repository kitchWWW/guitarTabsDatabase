[Verse 1]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Bdim[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch]
A woman needed healing of a dreaded disease[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Her money brought physicians, but only Jesus could bring relief[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Bdim[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
And though her last thread of hope was worn down to a strand[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                                      [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Her heart held on to faith, till she could touch Him with her hand[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Bdim[/ch]
Cause when you're hanging by a thread[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Still you can climb life's mountains,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
Though the cliffs are rough and jagged, you can cope[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Bdim[/ch]
But if you should slip and reach rope's end[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
You'll find the hem of His garment[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
So don't let go of that last thread of hope[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Bdim[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
And yet inside you, hanging onto, a frail and fragile faith[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Are you clinging to the rocks above the canyon of dismay?[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Bdim[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
Reach out for the lifeline, it will never break in two[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]
Hold fast, don't lose heart,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
For once again God will pull you through.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Bdim[/ch]
Cause when you're hanging by a thread[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Still you can climb life's mountains,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
Though the cliffs are rough and jagged, you can cope[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Bdim[/ch]
But if you should slip and reach rope's end[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
You'll find the hem of His garment[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
So don't let go of that last thread of hope[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Bdim[/ch]
But if you should slip and reach rope's end[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
You'll find the hem of His garment[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
So don't let go of that last thread of hope[/tab]

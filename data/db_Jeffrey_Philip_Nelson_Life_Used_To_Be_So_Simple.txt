Verse 5-6

I now stand with cancer its killing 
Unable to do things by myself
This is me

I wish to take twenty years back
Be poor and be kinder to the world
It’s a dream

Chorus

Life used to be so simple, but now things have changed
The money has taken my spirit away, I lost my soul
Now the capitals gained and now I am a different man

Verse 7-8

What a waste is money and power
Everything is not worth this dark void 
Its my heart

With the present time existing
Its all been taken away it’s the best thing
My new life

Chorus

Life used to be so simple, but now things have changed
The money has taken my spirit away, I lost my soul
Now the capitals gained and now I am a different man

[Intro]
NONE


[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]
I was born into struggle, born to survive[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
Born in a place that you don't make it out alive[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E/Ab[/ch]
They thought it was over, thought I was dead[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Gb7[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]
But you can't kill a man that was born to be born again[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
Been shaded in the shadow of doubt[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
So lost, thought I couldn't be found[/tab]
[tab][ch]E/Ab[/ch]
Everybody tried to count me out[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]
So that I can't lie[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]
I barely got by by the skin of my teeth (Ooh)[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
Sinkin' sand up under my feet (Ooh)[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E/Ab[/ch]
And I'll be damned if I ever let the end of me (Ooh)[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
Get the best of me, you see[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]
I was born into struggle, born to survive[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
Born in a place that you don't make it out alive[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E/Ab[/ch]
They thought it was over, thought I was dead[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Gb7[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]
But you can't kill a man that was born to be born again[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)[/tab]
                 E/AB
Born to be born again
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)[/tab]

[ch]Bm[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]Bm[/ch]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
Bent down at the end of my rope[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Hangin' on by the thread of my soul[/tab]
[tab][ch]E/Ab[/ch]
Givin' up just ain't in my bones[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Gb[/ch]
I keep my head held high[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
'Cause ain't no climb that is ever too steep (Ooh)[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
The waters rise, but they're never too deep (Ooh)[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E/Ab[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
I'll be damned if I ever let the end of me (Ooh)[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Gb[/ch]
Get the best of me, you see[/tab]

[Outro}
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                       [ch]A[/ch]

[ch]Gm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]Gm[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]

[Pre-Chorus]

[tab]      [ch]Gm[/ch]
First I breathe in the smoke, then I exhale slow[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]
Til there's nothing else left but the ashes[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Gm[/ch]                 [ch]Cm[/ch]
From all this weed I blow to all these drinks I pour[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bb[/ch]
There ain't nothing else left but the ashes[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]              [ch]Gm[/ch]
I feel like I don't wanna feel shit (I don't wanna feel shit)[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
I feel like I don't wanna feel shit (I don't wanna feel shit)[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Gm[/ch]
I feel like I don't wanna feel shit (I don't wanna feel shit)[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
I feel like I don't wanna feel shit (I don't wanna feel shit)[/tab]

[Post-Chorus]

[tab]               [ch]Gm[/ch]
And I can't be sober when I'm alone[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
A hundred missed calls in my phone[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Gm[/ch]
I'm havin' withdrawals, leave me alone[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bb[/ch]
Leave me alone, I feel it in my bones, I hide it all inside[/tab]

[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]Ebm[/ch]
I question myself, am I runnin' from something?, I put in the work, went from nothing to something[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
I still gotta deal with these fucked up assumptions[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
I'm drunk when in public, still chuggin' and numbin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
I was at rock bottom and I cried for help, So I had to take a break just to find myself[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Never been to Heaven, spent some time in Hell, Inside my shell, revenge what I'm tryna smell[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
I know it's all my fault, I'm the one to blame, Instead of facin' those fears, I would run away[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Couldn't tell apart all the love and hate[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]
So fuck the fame, I guess it's my drug of taste[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Gm[/ch]
I gotta clear my head and just hit restart, Just did 25 shows and there's 15 more[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
When the cycle repeats, it won't get me far, So I hide my pain deep within these scars[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
I got everybody sayin' I deserve to win, But is it worth the regret? Is it worth the sins?[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]Bb[/ch]
It hurts within, I'm thinkin' bout my worth again, I had to swim across the water 'cause I burnt the bridge[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Gm[/ch]
So I try to get by, but I hide shit inside, And I act like I'm havin' the time of my life[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bb[/ch]
And I can't see the darkness if I'm in the light, So if silence is golden then I'll be all right[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]

[tab]      [ch]Gm[/ch]               [ch]Cm[/ch]
First I breathe in the smoke, then I exhale slow[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]
Til there's nothing else left but the ashes[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Gm[/ch]
From all this weed I blow to all these drinks I pour[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]          [ch]Bb[/ch]
There ain't nothing else left but the ashes[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]                    [ch]Gm[/ch]         [ch]Cm[/ch]
I feel like I don't wanna feel shit (I don't wanna feel shit)[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]Bb[/ch]
I feel like I don't wanna feel shit (I don't wanna feel shit)[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Gm[/ch]                       [ch]Cm[/ch]
I feel like I don't wanna feel shit (I don't wanna feel shit)[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]Bb[/ch]
I feel like I don't wanna feel shit (I don't wanna feel shit)[/tab]

[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
I been on the bottom with all of the maggots, I relapsed again and fell off the wagon[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
I guess I'm just hopin' that all of my habits[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Will finally help me to deal with the baggage I'm carryin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                                                                   [ch]F[/ch]
This life of sin I'm thinkin' again of all of the friends I ended up buryin'[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
All of the dreams that I done seen perishin', Man, it's imperative I change the narrative[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Know what is wrong, knew all along deep in my heart, I'm tryin' to fly[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Why does it feel like I'm dyin' to live, but at the same I'm tryin' to die?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Won't you help me, Lord? I know I been selfish, Lord[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
I know I been wrong, but I feel like I been to Hell before[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
I just pour another drink to try to take the pain away[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]Bb[/ch]
Wonderin', is today the day that I'ma change my ways?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
No amount of cocaine could ever keep me numb[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]
From the shit that I done done and the past I'm runnin' from[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]

[tab]        [ch]Gm[/ch]                           [ch]Cm[/ch]
First I breathe in the smoke, then I exhale slow[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]Bb[/ch]
Til there's nothing else left but the ashes[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Gm[/ch]
From all this weed I blow to all these drinks I pour[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]Bb[/ch]
There ain't nothing else left but the ashes[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]                    [ch]Cm[/ch]
I feel like I don't wanna feel shit (I don't wanna feel shit)[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]
I feel like I don't wanna feel shit (I don't wanna feel shit)[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Gm[/ch]
I feel like I don't wanna feel shit (I don't wanna feel shit)[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]Bb[/ch]
I feel like I don't wanna feel shit (I don't wanna feel shit)[/tab]

[Post-Chorus]

[tab]               [ch]Gm[/ch]
And I can't be sober when I'm alone[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bb[/ch]
A hundred missed calls in my phone[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Gm[/ch]
I'm havin' withdrawals, leave me alone[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]                            [ch]Bb[/ch]
Leave me alone, I feel it in my bones, I hide it all inside[/tab]

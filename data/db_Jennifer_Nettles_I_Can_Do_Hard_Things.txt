VERSE:
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Sometimes I don't like it[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]E[/ch]
But that don't mean I don't love it[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
Sometimes I get down so low[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
But that don't mean I can't rise above it[/tab]

[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]
Sometimes it's the vast unknown[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
As far as I can see[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
And sometimes it feels like I'm touching everything[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
And everything is touching me[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
I've lost people and money[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]E[/ch]
To become the woman I am today[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
I'll still be becoming tomorrow[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
Maybe losin', but still choosin' her anyway[/tab]


CHORUS:
[tab]              [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
And oh it's a lot to look at all that I got[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
It's a lot to see who I am and I'm not[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]
But I can laugh and I can love and I can dream[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
And I can do hard things[/tab]

VERSE:
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
I look at my baby,[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]E[/ch]
I wouldn't trade him for the world[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
And I've gained joy like I've never known[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
But lost the lightness when I was a girl[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
We're told to say that it's better[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]E[/ch]
And it is and it isn't, and I know[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
That there's little black or white[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
There's little wrong or right[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
And mostly it's both[/tab]


CHORUS:
[tab]              [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
And oh it's a lot to look at all that I got[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
It's a lot to see who I am and I'm not[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]
But I can laugh I can love and I can dream[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
And I can do hard things[/tab]


BREAK:
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Sometimes I can hold it all[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]E[/ch]
I know where I end and where I start[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]
And sometimes it's all way too heavy[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
And I'm way more than the sum of all my parts[/tab]


CHORUS:
[tab]              [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
And oh it's a lot to look at all that I got[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
It's a lot to see who I am and I'm not[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]
But I can laugh and I can love and I can dream[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
I can win or I can lose, it's all the same[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]Bm[/ch]
I still dance, and I'll sing in the pain[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
And I can do hard things[/tab]

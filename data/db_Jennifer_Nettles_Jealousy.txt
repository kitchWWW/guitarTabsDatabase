[Intro] 
[ch]Gmaj7[/ch] [ch]Gmaj7[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Gmaj7[/ch] [ch]Gmaj7[/ch] CHmm [ch]C[/ch] 

[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
You moved so gracefully, nothing at all like me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                                            [ch]C[/ch]
Give us a smile and wave, you always did know to kill one, baby[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
I can't remember ever feeling this way[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
A burning feeling rushing all through my veins[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
What got in me is something more than envy[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]
I should be a- bove it, I know, but I just can't let it go[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
You might have heard it, I said you don't deserve him[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
But girl, don't take it personally, 'cause it's just j-j-j-jealousy[/tab]

[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
I didn't really mean to cause such an ugly scene[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                                                     [ch]C[/ch]
Sure went off at your house, half drunk and crazy b***h I called you out[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Or at that party where I made such a mess[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
And poured my whiskey down the back of your dress[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
What got in me is something more than envy[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]
I should be a- bove it, I know, but I just can't let it go[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
You might have heard it, I said you don't deserve him[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
But girl, don't take it personally, 'cause it's just j-j-j-jealousy[/tab]

[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
K-k-killing me, all my jealousy, k-k-killing me, all this jealousy[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
K-k-killing me, all my jealousy, k-k-killing me, all this jealousy[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
I'll stop clowning all that make-up you wear[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
I won't tell anyone you bought a new pair[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
I'll even tolerate your skanky fake hair[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Eb[/ch]
'Cause we both know you win, hon- ey you got him ---[/tab]

[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
K-k-killing me, all my jealousy, k-k-killing me, all my jealousy[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
K-k-killing me, all my jealousy, k-k-killing me, all my jealousy[/tab]

[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                                       [ch]C[/ch]
You can have him, you can have him, you can have him[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                                                   [ch]C[/ch]
Looking for something in green, I think you know what I mean[/tab]

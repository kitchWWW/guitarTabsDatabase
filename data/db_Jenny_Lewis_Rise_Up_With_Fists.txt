Artist: Jenny Lewis
Song: Rise Up With Fists
Genre: 
Key: 


Capo on 1st fret
The song is in A# instead of B in the live version, so i re-arranged the song using a
on the first fret instead of the 4th.  I did this for my transexual friend who kept
me weird transexual sex for it.  I turned him/her down but made the tab anyways.

What are you changing?[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Who do you think you're changing?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]
You can't change things[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
We're all stuck in our ways[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
It's like trying to clean the ocean[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
What do you think you can drain it?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Well it was poison and dry long before you came[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
But you can wake up younger under the knife[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
And you can wake up sounder if you get analyzed[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I better wake up[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
There but for the grace of God, go I[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
It's hard to believe your prophets[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
When they're asking you to change things[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
But with their suspect lives we look the other way[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Are you really that pure, Sir?[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Thought I saw you in Vegas[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
It was not pretty, but she was[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
But she will wake up wealthy[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And you will wake up 45[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And she will wake up with babies[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
There but for the grace of God, go I[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
What am I fighting for?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
The cops are at the front door[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
I can't escape that way, the windows are in flames[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
And what's that on your ankle?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
You say they're not coming for you[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
But house arrest is really just the same[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Like when you wake up behind the bar[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Trying to remember where you are[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Having crushed all the pretty things[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
There but for the grace of God, go I[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
But I still believe[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I will rise up with fists[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I will take what's mine mine mine[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
There but for the grace of God, go I[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
There but for the grace of God, go I[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
There but for the grace of God, go I[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
There but for the grace of God, go I[/tab]

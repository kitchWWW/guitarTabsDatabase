[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
I've always had trouble keeping that devil down[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                                 [ch]G[/ch]
When everything inside me died then I came up from the ground[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
I had to say goodbye to all of my old way[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                                         [ch]G[/ch]

Well I won't slow down till I see that old bright light[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
I hear them people talking it don't keep me up at night[/tab]

I was thinking about another time still in my mind [/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                [ch]C#m[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
When I used to know a little girl high on this world [/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                                        [ch]B[/ch]
Your baby loves you more than you know [/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                              [ch]B[/ch]
Raised on rivalry and rock'n roll [/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                           [ch]B[/ch]
Moving to the motor City soul[/tab]
 
She lets go 
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]
On the radio [/tab]

Well we never had a lot of cash 
But we loved those kids 
Some say that she missed the boat 
But she just burned the bridge 

The angels love you more than you know 
Raised on robbery and rock'n roll 
Moving to the Motor City soul 
She takes hold 
On the radio 

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
Stomachache Sundays [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]E[/ch]
And books we never read [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]E[/ch]
Well I was hoping one day [/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]B[/ch]
We might meet again [/tab]

((Accapella)

She used to talk about astrology 
She was born in June 
She danced with strangers and celebrities 
Empty stars and the full moon 

I was thinking about the universe 
For what its worth 
Or the one about the Phoenix bird 
That died and then returned )

The angels love you more than you know 
Raised on robbery and rock' n roll 
Moving to the Motor City soul 
Moving to the Motor City soul 
Sometimes I see her face 
When there's no place to go 
On the radio 
[tab]             [ch]C#m[/ch]
On the radio [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
On the radio [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]E[/ch]
Broken radio[/tab]

There?s a girl smoking cigarettes[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
She looks like you, looks like you[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
There?s a feeling I can?t forget[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
Coming through[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
Baby blue[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Well they tore another building down[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
It?s nothing new[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]

So we?re going out west where the winds won?t harm us now[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
And the car is in the lane[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
We?ll never be the same[/tab]

The stores are setting up for Halloween
Back at school the kids are cool
Painted ponies in this one horse town
Are getting old
I?ve been bought and sold

There?s a feeling I get when I talk to you mama
So we?re going out west where the winter winds won?t harm us now
There?s a feeling I get when I walk with you baby
So I hang around till the fall and I?ll be there
When you call

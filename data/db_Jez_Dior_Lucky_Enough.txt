[Intro]
N.C
Fell asleep with my cigarette lit
N.C
Had a dream the house went up
N.C
All it did was burn through the sheets
N.C
Guess that I'm lucky enough
N.C
Came home and my house got robbed
N.C
Took my laptop and my stuff
N.C
Least my guitar was still there
N.C
Guess that I'm lucky enough
N.C
I'm lucky enough


[Verse 1]
[tab] [ch]F#m[/ch]
To grab on that big o'l butt, just met her but I bet she cut[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
And I've been in this spot all night, bartender got me drunk[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I've been off the Xans for days, my head's feelin' really light[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
I sleep all throughout the day and I won't wake up through the night[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Least I got friends, but I miss my family, my mom and my sister, my grammy[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
My girl the best, she put up with me, she knows I'ma get me a Grammy[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Walkin' down the boulevard steppin' on all the stars[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
That'll be me one day, the world is about to be ours[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]F#m[/ch]
I fell asleep with my cigarette lit[/tab]

Had a dream the house went up
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
All it did was burn through the sheets[/tab]

I guess that I'm lucky enough
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Came home and my house got robbed[/tab]

Took my laptop and my stuff
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
At least my guitar was still there[/tab]

Guess that I'm lucky enough, I'm lucky enough


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
To rock out on that stage [?], ooh this pays[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I'ma get me into it, enough drinks here for the rage[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Got a studio to make my songs[/tab]

Got a card to swipe when I'm on
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
My homie know all these spots[/tab]

All the spots with the baddest jawns
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
This life we live, this life is it[/tab]

Wherever we're headed we're bout to be rich
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
And even if not, we still got it locked[/tab]

Still got a jacket, and still got the pot
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Still got a heart, still got these dreams[/tab]

Still made it all to fly with these wings
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
I'm lucky for y'all, I'm lucky for fame[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
I'm lucky I'm here this song is so free[/tab]

I'm lucky enough


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]

I'm lucky, I'm lucky, I'm lucky, enough[/tab]

I'm lucky, I'm lucky, I'm lucky, enough
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]

[tab]       [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
 We're holding it together[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Em7[/ch]
 Eventually it has to get better[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D/F#[/ch]
 Doesn't it[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                               [ch]Em7[/ch]     [ch]D/F#[/ch]
 Isn't that the way it's supposed to go[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
 We're forcing out these smiles[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Em7[/ch]
 Eventually we're gonna get tired[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D/F#[/ch]
 Aren't we[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Cadd9[/ch]               [ch]Em7[/ch]    [ch]D/F#[/ch]
 Doesn't it already show[/tab]


[tab]          [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
 It's all coming crashing down[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em7[/ch]             [ch]D/F#[/ch]
 We're about to all find out[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                          [ch]Em7[/ch]     [ch]D/F#[/ch]
 We're not as strong as we tell ourselves we are, we are[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
 Bottles laying on the ground[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em7[/ch]           [ch]D/F#[/ch]
 Our tracks are all over this town[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                     [ch]Em7[/ch]
 And all the signs we see are leading us out[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D/F#[/ch]       [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
 But we're still here[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em7[/ch]
 We are, we are[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D/F#[/ch]       [ch]Cadd9[/ch]  
 We're still here[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em7[/ch]    [ch]D/F#[/ch]
 We are, we are[/tab]


[tab]     [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
 Our heads hang low[/tab]

 Our weakness shows
[tab]      [ch]Em7[/ch]                   [ch]D/F#[/ch]
 Our pride keeps turning us back[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                            [ch]Em7[/ch]    [ch]D/F#[/ch]
 Don't you think everybody knows[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
 If we don't get this figured out[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em7[/ch]              [ch]D/F#[/ch]             [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
 It's sure to break us down and we won't ever find[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em7[/ch]    [ch]D/F#[/ch]
 Our way back home[/tab]

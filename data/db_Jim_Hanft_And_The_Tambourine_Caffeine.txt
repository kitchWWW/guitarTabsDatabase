[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]                  
And if he comes back, I don’t think of might[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]                                    
As long as his Limousine picks you up on time[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]
And how can you be sure about it?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
If you’re still alone[/tab]

Does he raise you up to where you belong?
Does he do more than turn you on?
And how can you be sure about it?
If you’re still alone

[Chorus]
[tab]                           [ch]F[/ch]
Cause in the city tonight,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
I can’t sleep and your face is a strong caffeine[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I’m rolling around at your door[/tab]

You’re wondering who you think I’ll be
Can’t you see who I am and the man in me?
And how can I be sure about it?
When you pull me then you push me away

And the cigarettes from that friend of yours
You can smoke them on the Porsche just close the door 
And how can I be sure about it?
If you pull me then you push me away

[Chorus]
Cause in the city tonight,
I can’t sleep and your face is a strong caffeine
I’m rolling around at your door

[Bridge]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
No I won’t back down, go fight another war[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
(Come on now; tell what I’m fighting for?)[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
No I won’t back down, go fight another war[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
(Come on now; tell what I’m fighting for?)[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
No I won’t back down, go fight another war[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
(Come on now; tell what I’m fighting for?)[/tab]

[Chorus] Soft
In the city tonight,
I can’t sleep and your face is a strong caffeine
I’m rolling around at your door
Cause In the city tonight,
I can’t sleep and your face is a strong caffeine
I’m rolling around at your door

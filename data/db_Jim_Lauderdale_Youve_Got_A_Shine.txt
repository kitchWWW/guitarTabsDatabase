YOU'VE GOT A SHINE
As recorded by Jim Lauderdale
(2024 release)



[Intro]
[ch]A[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]A7[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
It's hard to get from one place to another[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
Even more when fumbling through the dark[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
And getting lost with lots of ground to cover[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
Looking for a light that is not too far[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
You've got a shine[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
Gonna shine[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
That's going on without you even trying[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
You've got a shine[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
It's gonna shine[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
Coming from your heart right through your eye[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
They never knew you were a dusty diamond[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
Blending in and hidden in the rough[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
Not noticing nobody else was minding[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
When you're around the goings not so tough[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
You've got a shine[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
It's gonna shine[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
That's going on without you even trying[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
You've got a shine[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
It's gonna shine[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
Coming from your heart right through your eye[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
Well what we see is quite a bright reflection[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
Growing from a spark there deep inside[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]F#m[/ch]
Following the glow in your direction[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]E7[/ch]
Watching while you walk into the light[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]     [ch]A7[/ch]
Look up at there at that twinkling constellation[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
Offering direction in the night[/tab]

When you're around its such a constellation[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
It makes me feel that everything is alright[/tab]

Coming from your heart[/tab]

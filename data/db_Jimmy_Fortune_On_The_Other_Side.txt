On the other side - the sun always shines[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
No minutes, no hours, there’s no such thing as time[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Where streets are paved with gold[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
And you never grow old[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
On the other side - everybody sings[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
There’s miles and miles of flowers and lots of pretty things[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
Where the skies a perfect blue[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Well I’ve never been to heaven - didn’t know what it was like[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
But God let me have a glimpse - in my dream last night[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And I could see you smiling - and you were looking right at me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
And for the first time in a long time - on your face I saw some peace[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
And I knew everything was gonna be all right[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
On the other siiiiide[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Oh oh the other side[/tab]

[Verse 3]

On the other side - do you ever see me cry[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Do you know how much I miss you - wish I could have said goodbye[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Just one more I love you - oh, am I really getting through[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
On the other side[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Well I’ve never been to heaven - didn’t know what it was like[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
But God let me have a glimpse - in my dream last night[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And I could hear you laughing - and you were looking right at me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
And for the first time in a long time - on your face I saw some peace[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
He was old as he walked slowly through the park[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]D[/ch]
To the bench where he would sleep on after dark[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
He saw a bird high in a tree[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
He said listen carefully[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D7[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
So your life would not end in misery[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
Don't fly to high my little bird[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
'cause if you try you may get hurt[/tab]

You will burn your wings
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
When you reach for the sun[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Don't fly to high my little bird[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
Your lonley cry it won't be heard[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D7[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
You'll be tumbling down to the ground[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]D7[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D7[/ch]
'cause proud will have a fall[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Then the little bird came flying from the tree[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
And he landed softley on the old mans' knee[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
Just a tiny piece of bread, that was all the old man had[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D7[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
But he gave it too the little bird and said[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
Don't fly to high my little bird[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
'cause if you try you may get hurt[/tab]

You will burn your wings
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
When you reach for the sun[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Don't fly to high my little bird[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
Your lonley cry it won't be heard[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D7[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
You'll be tumbling down to the ground[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]D7[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D7[/ch]
'cause proud will have a fall[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Then one morning the old man went to the highway[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]D[/ch]
All the cars he tried to stop were passing by[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
So he could not save his friend[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
Who was dying in his hand[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D7[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Becsuse his broken wings would never mend again[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
Don't fly to high my little bird[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
'cause if you try you may get hurt[/tab]

You will burn your wings
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
When you reach for the sun[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Don't fly to high my little bird[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
Your lonley cry it won't be heard[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D7[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
You'll be tumbling down to the ground[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]D7[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D7[/ch]
'cause proud will have a fall[/tab]

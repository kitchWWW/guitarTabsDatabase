Intro
[ch]E[/ch] - [ch]B[/ch] - [ch]C#m[/ch] - [ch]A[/ch] (x2)
[tab]                  [ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]F#m[/ch]
Now I don't know much, but the one thing I do,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]
is that love, love hurt that touch,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#m[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]
Her jealous roots. And you're the flower in a bed, we're born to lose.[/tab]

[tab][ch]B[/ch]                    [ch]C#m[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
Oooh I, Ooooh I, Oooh I, I--[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]
I need exception, from the rules of attraction,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C#m[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
'cause I really really really can't accept them[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]B[/ch]
Your so above me, in the measure of beauty,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
and I don't think it's fair that that should stop me. [/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]           [ch]F#m[/ch]
Oh I know, you'll never see, the heart that beats underneath.[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F#m[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
That's why I need exception from the rules of attraction when it comes to you.[/tab]


[ch]E[/ch] - [ch]B[/ch] - [ch]C#m[/ch] - [ch]A[/ch] (x2)

[tab]                    [ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]F#m[/ch]
Lies feed from the lust, and it's poisonous fruit.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
And baby you, you can't help but love, its shallow juice.[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
There's so much you'll never see, 'cause you can't see through.[/tab]

[tab][ch]B[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]F#m[/ch]
Oooh I, Oooh I, Oooh I, I---[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]
I need exception, from the rules of attraction,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C#m[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
'cause I really really really can't accept them[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]B[/ch]
Your so above me, in the measure of beauty,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
and I don't think it's fair that that should stop me. [/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]           [ch]F#m[/ch]
Oh I know, you'll never see, the heart that beats underneath.[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F#m[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
That's why I need exception from the rules of attraction when it comes to you.[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch] - [ch]B[/ch] - [ch]C#m[/ch]        -       [ch]A[/ch]
      Oh when it comes to you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
   Don't you know the path you're on is paved[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
With all the hearts you left broken and bleeding.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
And can't you see the you're living only ends [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
With lying and cheating, hurt and deceiving.  [/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]     [ch]B7[/ch]
Haaaa[/tab]

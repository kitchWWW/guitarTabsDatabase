This sounds right to me.  My first tab though.  
Any help would be appreciated.  You can leave the 
Em out of the chorus if you want or add it to the 
verse.  I just do what feels right.

She's the girl of my dreams she gives me everything 
wearin short shorts or some tight blue jeans 
she's country, and she aint afraid to break a nail raise hell or go to jail 
I keep her by my side, she's always ready to ride 
and sometimes she even drives when it's in 4 wheel drive 
never known to back down from anything 
and you know she keeps her motor clean, yeah 

Chorus 

She could be the centerfold of field and stream 
holding that double barrel 12 gauge 
to me aint nothin sweeter Jawga peach 
plain air guitar to a song I sing, song I sing, song I sing 

talkin bout that pretty little redneck girl ridin shotgun 
sun kissed by the Georgia hot son 
whoaaa she's a hot one, yeah yeah

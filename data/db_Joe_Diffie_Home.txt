Here is a redo on the .crd file I e-mailed earlier.
The format was not retained on the earlier version
and I apologize.

"HOME" by Joe Diffie

Verse 1:

[D]The only the thing I see ahead is

[G] just the heat [A]a rising off the[D] road

[D]The rainbows I've been chasing keep on

[G]fading before I [A] find my pot of [D]gold

[G]But more and more I'm thinking, that the only treasures

[A]that I'll ever [D]kno[G]ow

[D]Are long ago and far behind and [A]wrapped up in my

[G]memories o
[ch]F[/ch] [[ch]D[/ch]]home


Chorus:

[G]Home was a swimming hole and a fishing pole

and the feel of a muddy row between my [D]toes

[G]Home was a back porch swing where I would sit

and mom would sing[D] amazing grace

While she hung out the [A]clothes,

[G]Home was an easy chair with my daddy there

and the smell of Sunday supper on the [D]sto-[G]ve

[D]My footsteps carry me away but [A]in my mind I'm

[G]always going [D]home


Verse 2:

[D]Now the miles I put behind me ain't as

[tab][[ch]G[/ch]][ch]H[/ch]
ard as the [A]miles that lay[D] ahead[/tab]

[D]And its much to late to listen to the

[G]words of wisdom [A]that my daddy[D] said

[G]The straight and narrow path he showed me turned into a

[A]thousand winding [D]ro-[G]oads,

[D]My footsteps carry me away, but [A]in my mind I'm

[G]always going [D]home.


Repeat Chorus (then add)


[G]Yeah, the straight and narrow path he showed me turned into a

[A]thousand winding [D]ro-[G]oads,

[D]My footsteps carry me away, but [A]in my mind I'm


[G]always going [D]home.

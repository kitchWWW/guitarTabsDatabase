[Intro]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
You say you never felt for me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
The way I feel for you[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
And you're sorry if you ever lead me on[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
You told me time and time again[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
That I can't miss your love[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
What never was can't be really gone[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
But, what ab out Denver[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
Don't you re member[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
Lying in my arms[/tab]
Under Colorado stars
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
We could see for ever[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
It wasn't just the moon[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
You had to feel it too[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Girl, if you and I[/tab]
Were nothing but a lie
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
What about Denver[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
You may say the night you showed up[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Crying at my door[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Was a momentary weakness at the time[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
And all the mornings that I found you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Lying by my side[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Well, you can go and blame it on the wine[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
But, what ab out Denver[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
Don't you re member[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
Lying in my arms[/tab]
Under Colorado stars
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
We could see for ever[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
It wasn't just the moon[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
You had to feel it too[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]

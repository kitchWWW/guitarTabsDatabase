Here's my favorite Joe Jackson tune, as close as I can get it.
I'm not sure about the G/A and G/B in the chorus, but I can't
find anything else close.  I believe the rest is right after
seeing Joe a couple of times in 91.  Listen to the tune to get
the struming pattern down -  its not as easy as it looks.
Correct as needed.

So tell me who'll take the blame[/tab]


For the way things turned out

Verse 2 - same pattern as 1st

Well six long months passed and Johnny
was the hottest thing alive
We loved Johnny and we owned Johnny
Nobody knew how Johnny felt inside
But Johnny was beautiful he was like a God
We all went along for the ride
The ride started to go too fast
Johnny just conviently died


Prechorus 2(same as 1st)
And he went up in flames
He did what he had to do

[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]G/A[/ch]   [ch]G/B[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]

And you and I, you and I just fade away[/tab]

Verse 3 - same as other two
Well now days there's lots of guys like Johnny
They got it all worked out, like working nine to five
But they're all cartoons, they all think they're superman
But they can't even fly
They say that Johnny's ghost walks down in Memphis
Wehn the moon is full and high
And I wonder if he sees these jokers
I wonder if he laughs or if he cries

Prechorus - same
Now he's an angel in flames
but what about you and me.

Chorus twice

You said, "Come back down, come back down, Joe"[/tab]

I go down to see her in the late afternoon

She ain't easy to find she's always moving, moving

She's kicking back coffee with Anthony telling jokes

I say, "Girl if we don't go soon we're gonna miss the show"

She says, "Come back down, come back down, Joe"


So we go down to see if we can get on a list to play

And I go in walking like I own the place

We wait our turn, but we don't wait long

Me and Miss Jenny just singing our songs in a row, yeah we're on a roll

She says, "Come back down, come back down, Joe

Come back down, come back down"


Scarecrow's in full bloom tonight as they take the stage

So we say goodbye to Zachariah and we get on our way

And on the way home I say, "Tell me a story please, please"

She says, "Did you ever hear the one about the duck that got stuck in a street?

Says I huffed and I puffed and I shooed him away

How do I stop the sunset in the middle of the day

I watched him grow wings and fly away, fly away"

Night's almost through but she wants to sing me a song

Said I love how you sing, girl, but it's just a little too long

'Cause there's only four seasons and this one's almost gone

These nights feel so good and this one's almost gone


She says, "Come back down, come back down, Joe"

She says, "Come back down, come back down"

She says, "Come back down, come back down, Joe, come back tomorrow

Maybe we'll take a date

Maybe we'll grab a drink or see a movie or I don't know"

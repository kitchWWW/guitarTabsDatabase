But I'm not what you need[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
I've known you so much stronger[/tab]

So I guess that I'll dream of you a little longer[/tab]

[ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

I want to pack up and move with you, oh and never look behind

I want to take your hand as we chase down the skyline

I want to tell you my stories, wake you up in the middle of the night

I want you to tell me when I'm wrong, and I just want you to smile at me when I'm right

It would be nice if I could hold you tight[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
While I lay in the sand[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I guess you could call it our summer of freedom,[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
The year that we both turned eigh-teen.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
We hitchhiked to Denver, fresh out of high school.[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Man, we were sights to be seen.[/tab]

That was the year that you dated my cousin,
[tab]                               [ch]C[/ch]
'Til they took us away in the fall.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
Now I dearly wish you were standing here with me,[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]D[/ch]
As I touch your name on the wall.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Touch a name on the wall, Touch a name on the wall,[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Lord, help us all. Touch a name on the wall.[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Each time I come here, I wear my fatigues,[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
To honor the men that I knew.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
And I touch every name that came from my outfit,[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]G[/ch]
And read 'em out loud when I do.[/tab]

Some people say that they all died for nothin',
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
But I can't completely a-gree.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause this brother here, he didn't die for no country,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
He died for me.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Touch a name on the wall, Touch a name on the wall,[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Lord, help us all. Touch a name on the wall..[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Now, Usually walls are just made for division.[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
They separate me from you[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
But God bless the wall that brings us together,[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
And reminds us of what we've been through.[/tab]

To hell with the liars and the tin-plated heroes,
[tab]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
That trade on the blood of these men.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                                                       [ch]G[/ch]
And God give us the strength to stand up and tell 'em, "Never a-gain!"[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Touch a name on the wall, Touch a name on the wall,[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Lord, help us all. Touch a name on the wall.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Touch a name on the wall, Touch a name on the wall,[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Lord, help us all. Touch a name on the wall.[/tab]

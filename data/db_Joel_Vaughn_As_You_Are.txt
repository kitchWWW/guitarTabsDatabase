[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
Some days you feel like you're so far[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
And hope is a light in the dark[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]
'cause all you see is your mistakes[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
But He sees you in a different way[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]
There's never been a day, that you've gone too far[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
When everything around you, could fall apart[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
No, you don't have to be stronger than you are[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Bm[/ch]
He want's your heart[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Bm[/ch]
You can come just as you are[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
You can come[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
I know, it's hard not to fake it[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
But perfection, is a myth in the distance[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
It's not about the things you do[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
You're already the perfect you[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
When everything around you, could fall apart[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
No, you don't have to be stronger than you are[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
When you can see the road ahead[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
And nothing else makes perfect sense[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
It doesn't matter what you did[/tab]

You can come, just as you are[/tab]

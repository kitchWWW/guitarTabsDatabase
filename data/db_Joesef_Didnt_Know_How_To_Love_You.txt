One, two three, and-
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch] [ch]C#m[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch]
aaaah-[/tab]

When you touch me, it just doesn't feel like it did before[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                                           [ch]C#m[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
Different reasons, can't help feeling I don't love you no more[/tab]
But I won't apologize

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]F#m[/ch]
'Cause I'm not sorry[/tab]
Why should I be?
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]                                   [ch]Bm[/ch]
I fucked your friend, but, honey, you know you left me[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F#m[/ch]
You said I'm heartless[/tab]
I'm just trying to start shit
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]                           [ch]Bm[/ch]
You should've never trust a man who's brokenhearted (one, two, three)[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                            [ch]F#m[/ch]
'Cause I didn't know how to love you ('cause I didn't know how to love you)[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C#m[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]

[tab]                            [ch]F#m[/ch]
After everything that we've been through (everything that we've been through)[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C#m[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
It washes over me (washes over me)[/tab]

[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                                             [ch]C#m[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
Absent feelings change like seasons, can't look you in the eye[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                                       [ch]C#m[/ch]     [ch]Bm[/ch]
When we finish, only distance, all that's left is tonight[/tab]
I won't apologize

[Pre-Chorus]

[tab]               [ch]F#m[/ch]
'Cause I'm not sorry[/tab]
Why should I be? (Why should I be?)
[tab]           [ch]C#m[/ch]                              [ch]Bm[/ch]
'Cause the end was always coming, can't you see?[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F#m[/ch]
You said I'm heartless[/tab]
I'm just trying to start shit
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]                           [ch]Bm[/ch]
You should've never trust a man who's brokenhearted[/tab]

It washes over me (washes over me)[/tab]

[Bridge]

[tab][ch]G#m7[/ch]                         [ch]GM7[/ch]

[tab]               [ch]F#m[/ch]
You were still calling[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
He's in my room[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m7[/ch]               [ch]GM7[/ch]

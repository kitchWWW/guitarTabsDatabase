[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
Harold Wilson is my name son, why don't you sit a spell[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]Am[/ch]
I live right here on the Ferguson Road at the Paradise Motel[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]
And though you do not know me, there's a story I like to tell[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                               [ch]F[/ch]
It's a story that I'm sure you know well[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
It's a story that I'm sure you know well[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
I had me a place on Thunder Ridge in a doomsday shack[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
My wife had left, and took the kids a couple of years back[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]
And I spent most of my mornings thinking about that[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]                                           [ch]F[/ch]
And my afternoons trying to figure out what to plant[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                               [ch]Am[/ch]
I spend my afternoons trying to figure out what to plant[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
Did you ever try to farm a farm with a pick and a shovel[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Try to put a field into corn just wouldn't grow nothin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Starin' down across the town, you wonder why I even bother[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                      [ch]F[/ch]
When up the road there's a vacant room climate control and color[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]Am[/ch]
And you could stay there by the month for a hundred dollars[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]Am[/ch]
And you could stay there by the month for a hundred dollars[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
There wasn't money in corn and there wasn't money in beans[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
They took my telephone, shut off my electricity[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]Am[/ch]
Then a letter came in the mail saying there's taxes owed by me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]                                         [ch]F[/ch]
If I was ever going to pay well, I had three weeks[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                         [ch]Am[/ch]
If I was ever going to pay well, I had three weeks[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]

And you could stay there by the month for a hundred dollars[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]Am[/ch]
Well, they sold that farm to some fool for ten cents on the dollar[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                       [ch]Am[/ch]
I saw him out there last week, I was on my way to visit my daughter[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                                             [ch]Am[/ch]
And that son of a bitch was out there trying to hook a windmill up to water[/tab]
[tab] [ch]E[/ch]                                                    [ch]F[/ch]
When he heard me laugh, well, he turned and I swear he hollered[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                                 [ch]Am[/ch]
When he heard me laugh, well, he turned, I swear he hollered[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                                         [ch]Am[/ch]
Now the government checks come down the pike, regular as rain[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                                         [ch]Am[/ch]
And I sit outside most nights 'cept when the June bugs drive me in[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]

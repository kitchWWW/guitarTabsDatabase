I Saw A Stranger With Your Hair -- John Gorka

[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
I saw a stranger with your hair[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Am[/ch]
Tried to make her give it back...[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
So I could send it back to you[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Maybe Federal Express[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Cause I know you'd miss it[/tab]

I saw another with your eyes
The flash just turned my head...
I went to try them on for size
but they looked the other way
And they wouldn't listen

[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
Chorus: But you're never hard to find in a crowd[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
The people around you are smiling out loud[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
Their feet don't touch the ground[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
No, their feet don't touch the ground[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
No, their feet don't touch the ground[/tab]


I heard a stranger with your voice
It took me by surprise...
Again I found it wasn't you
Just an angel in disguise
In for a visit

By the way how is my heart
Haven't seen it since you left...
I'm almost sure it followed you
Could you sometime send it back,
I'll buy the ticket

Chorus
    G                       C        G/B   G  (same chords each line and
fade)
I saw a stranger with your hair
I saw another with your eyes
I heard an angel with your voice
By the way how is my heart
By the way how is my heart....

   It's enough to make a guy like me feel sad.[/tab]


[tab]                          [ch]E[/ch]
   Cause you tell me that Jesus, he hates fruit loops son,[/tab]

   We told you that when you were young,
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
   or pretty much anything you want him to,[/tab]

   Like sitcoms, pedophiles and kangaroos,
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
   Morons who cut in line,[/tab]

   Three-bean salad and parking fines,
[tab]               [ch]B[/ch]
   And when we win this war on society,[/tab]
[tab]                                                    [ch]E[/ch]
   I hope your blind eyes will be opened and you'll see.[/tab]

   The arrogance it takes to walk around in the world the way you do,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]          G#maj
   It turns my brain to jelly every time,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]             [ch]C#m[/ch](maj7)      [ch]E[/ch]               G#maj

   And I think that I might be about to commit a crime.[/tab]


[tab]                          [ch]E[/ch]
   And you tell me that Jesus, He hates homos son,[/tab]

   We told you that when you were young,
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
   Or pretty much anything you want him to,[/tab]

   Like coco puffs, red cars and jews,
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]
   Postal clerks who waste your time,[/tab]

   Weight loss shakes, and the local news,
[tab]               [ch]B[/ch]
   And when we win the war on society,[/tab]
[tab]                                                    [ch]E[/ch]

[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]
   Cause Jesus, He hates faggots son,[/tab]

   We told you that when you were young,
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
   Or pretty much anyone you want him to,[/tab]

   Like niggers, spicks, redskins and kikes,
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]
   Men who cannot tame their wives,[/tab]

   Weaklings, cowards, and bald dykes,
[tab]               [ch]B[/ch]
   And when we win the war on society,[/tab]
[tab]                                                    [ch]E[/ch]
   I hope your blind eyes will be opened and you'll see.[/tab]

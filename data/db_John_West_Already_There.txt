              Already There
        John West feat. Big Sean
-----------------------------------------
Tabbed by: Rogelio
Tuning: Standard
Capo on 3

The notation I use to describe how to play the intro and verse chords is a little weird,
I know, but that's the best way I can put it. Basically, the main chords to play are
the G, C(maj7), A7 and D7. The Em is optional, but it transitions well and sounds pretty 
nice. Other than that, the tab overall seems pretty accurate.

[tab]Chords [ [ch]E[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]B[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] ]:

  + + + +   +     + +  +   +  + + +   +  + + +

[tab]Verse 1:
(For both the first and second verse, play the same chords as the intro in the same manner)
  + + + +   +     + +  +   +  + + +   +  + + +

Yeah, we're already there
Uh, we're ready to wait
We've been through craziness, but we always come prepared
I feel like Apple stock, I feel like Louis Vuitton
I feel like John Legend mixed with a little Kan
This is our generation, this is our time
We're revolutionaries standing on the front line
I always got your back, so now let's get the fame
We're taking giant steps, John Coltraine

Verse 2: (same as Verse 1)
[tab][ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Cmaj7[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]A7[/ch]   [ch]D7[/ch]
Big bottles, I deserve the big bottles[/tab]
Keep that champagne pop, pop, pop, pop
Might just need your goggles
I got good drinks, bad girl
You know that opposites attract
See I came from the bottom, so what's the opposite of that?
Top shelf, top floor, got a top model with her top off
Got a top chef, making five-course
I'm top five, then drop four
Is this the top of the world?
I'm living with the people I die for
And if they ain't at the top with you, then you ain't at the top

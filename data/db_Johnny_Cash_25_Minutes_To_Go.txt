[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Well they're building a gallows outside my cell[/tab]
 
[tab]                       [ch]D7[/ch]
I've got 25 minutes to go[/tab]

        
And the whole town's waiting just to hear me yell
 
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I got 24 minutes to go[/tab]



Well they gave me some beans for my last meal 

[tab]                    [ch]D7[/ch]
I got 23 minutes to go[/tab]


But nobody ask me how I feel
 
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I got 22 minutes to go[/tab]



Well I sent for the governor and the whole darn bunch 

[tab]                   [ch]D7[/ch]
With 21 minutes to go[/tab]


And I called up the mayor but he's out to lunch 

[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
I got 20 more minutes to go[/tab]



Then the sheriff said boy I'm gonna watch you die 

[tab]                   [ch]D7[/ch]
With 19 minutes to go[/tab]


So I laughed in his face and I spit in his eye
 
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
With 18 minutes to go[/tab]
 


Now here comes the preacher for to save my soul 

[tab]                   [ch]D7[/ch]
With 13 minutes to go[/tab]


And he's talking bout burning but I'm so cold 

[tab]                             [ch]G[/ch]
And I got 12 more minutes to go[/tab]



Now they're testing the trap and it chills my spine 

[tab]                        [ch]D7[/ch]
With 11 more minutes to go[/tab]


And the trap and the rope oh they work just fine 

[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Got 10 more minutes to go[/tab]



Well I'm waiting for the pardon that'll set me free 

[tab]                       [ch]D7[/ch]
With 9 more minutes to go[/tab]


But this ain't the movies so forget about me 

[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Got 8 more minutes to go[/tab]



With my feet on the trap and my head in the noose 

[tab]                  [ch]D7[/ch]
5 more minutes to go[/tab]


Won't somebody come and cut me loose 

[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Got 4 more minutes to go[/tab]



I can see the mountains I can see the sky
 
[tab]                  [ch]D7[/ch]
3 more minutes to go[/tab]


And it's too darn pretty for a man to wanna die 

[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
I got 2 more minutes to go[/tab]



I can see the buzzards I can hear the crows 

[tab]                 [ch]D7[/ch]
1 more minute to go[/tab]


And now I'm swinging
 
                  
And here I go-o-o-o

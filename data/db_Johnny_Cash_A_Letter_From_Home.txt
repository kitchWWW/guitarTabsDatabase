[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
A cowpoke rode in one hot dusty day [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
To a store down in old San Antone[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]           
He stood at the window and I heard him say[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
Do I have a letter from home[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
The postmaster looked through the mail that had come[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
Then smilingly shook his grey head[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
The cowpoke looked sadly a moment at him[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
And these are the words that he said[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
No letter from home, no letter from home[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
There's never a letter from home[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch] 
No message from Mother or none of the others[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
There's never a letter from home[/tab]

[Break]
[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                              
That night he was shot on the wrong side of town[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
No more on those plains will he roam[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
I reached for my Bible and gave it to him[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
And said son here's your letter from home[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
If only I had just a little more time[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch] 
To read it The young cowboy said[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
I can't take it with me and I must go on[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Then he died with his letter unread[/tab]

//Repeat chorus
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
The letter from home, the letter from home[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
No time for the letter from home[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
The cowboy lay dead with his letter unread[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Too late for the letter from home[/tab]


[Outro]
[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]

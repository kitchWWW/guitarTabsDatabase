[Verse 1]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]A7[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
In a war-torn land of poverty somewhere across the sea[/tab]
[tab]                                                        [ch]E[/ch]
There's a little boy who's waiting, he looks a lot like me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
His hair is like the sunlight on the wings of a crow[/tab]
[tab]                                          [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]A7[/ch]
I don't know what they named him, but I'm sure they call him Joe[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Just a little boy called Joe, like so many more I know[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
Left all alone somewhere across the sea[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]A7[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
I want him to have my name, little Joe was mine to claim[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
This little boy called Joe belongs to me[/tab]

His mother died to give him life the night my orders came[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]E[/ch]
I wanted to be with him, but war's an evil thing[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]A7[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
Now, he won't recognize me, but I've got to let him know[/tab]
[tab]                                               [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]A7[/ch]
That he means much more to someone than just a little boy called Joe[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]D[/ch](pm)                [ch]A[/ch](pm)
I was wrong so please listen up[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]B[/ch](pm)                    [ch]A[/ch](pm)                [ch]G[/ch](pm)
You're building up walls and I know it makes you feel tough[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch](pm)              [ch]A[/ch](pm)
Believe it or not I was trying to help[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]B[/ch](pm)               [ch]A[/ch](pm)            [ch]G[/ch]
I was doing my best but I know I didn't do well[/tab]

CH. 1:

[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
When we fight and I raise my voice at you[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Are we arguing so we can't hear the words?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
I feel as if I'm all alone no one by my side[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]               (stop)
But I know (but I know) why you're in my life[/tab]


[ch]D[/ch]-[ch]A[/ch]-[ch]E[/ch]*-[ch]G[/ch]*-[ch]F#[/ch]* (4X)


[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
A loose tongue cuts so deep[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]B[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I leave it there even though I cause you to weep[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
My big mouth causes a stir[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
She loses respect for me I lose it for her[/tab]


[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Foolish words cause a mound of my distrust[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Or so we really think that things might not work out[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Cause we're born again by a love that's much deeper and much wider[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
But I know (but I know) why you're in my life[/tab]

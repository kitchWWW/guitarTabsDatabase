[tab]   [ch]F#m[/ch] 
   Is there anyone there to guide you?[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
   Anyone to stand beside you?[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C#m[/ch]                            [ch]B[/ch]  [ch]C#m[/ch]
   See no one, nothing but your fear[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]F#m[/ch]  
   You breathe despair, must feel so lonely[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
   Do you feel like you're the one and only?[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C#m[/ch]                           [ch]B[/ch]  [ch]C#m[/ch]
   Disappointment follows you around[/tab]

[tab] [ch]F#m[/ch]                      
   You tell yourself “they'll never break me”[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
   But you're a wreck and you're sick of hating[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C#m[/ch]                                    [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]C#m[/ch]
   Fighting ghosts that no one else but only you can see[/tab]

[tab] [ch]F#m[/ch]
   You got to ask what are your choices[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
   To keep going or obey the voices[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C#m[/ch]                                    [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]C#m[/ch]
   This world is sick and it's building up to self-destruct[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]F#m[/ch]
   They reject your own direction[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
   You lost all connections[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C#m[/ch]                           [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]C#m[/ch]
   Paralyzed and desensitized, blinded by the lights[/tab]

[tab] [ch]F#m[/ch]
   You tricked yourself you know it[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
   But you just don't want to show it[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C#m[/ch]                         [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]C#m[/ch]
   Recognizing and embracing triumph in defeat [/tab]

[tab] [ch]F#m[/ch]
   There's a whisper going through your senses[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
   Telling you to build higher fences[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C#m[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]C#m[/ch]
   No one's allowed inside to pray on your demise[/tab]

[tab] [ch]F#m[/ch]  
   Your mind's set on disaster[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
   The end's approaching fast and[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C#m[/ch]                                    [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]C#m[/ch]
   This world is sick and it's building up to self destruct[/tab]

Yo. All the rappers claim to not give a fuck.
Well step aside bitches, cause I give the lowest amount of fuck humanly possible.

What?!

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
(I don't a give a fuck...)[/tab]
About anything, fuck everyone and fuck everything, what
(I don't give a fuck...)
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
I literally don't give a fuck about anything[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I don't give a fuck about motherfuckin' anything[/tab]
People care about shit, I say fuck everything
[tab]                                                       [ch]F[/ch]
Fuck you, fuck me, fuck the sky, fuck trees, fuck the sun[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]E[/ch]
I don't need heat or Vitamin D![/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And fuck toasters. I don't need to cook my bread[/tab]
And fuck coasters. I use a little plate instead
And fuck roosters. With their useless cockadoodledoo
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
We invented the alarm clocks. We no longer need you[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Don't give a fuck about chairs. I prefer to stand[/tab]
And fuck air conditioners - I got a ceiling fan
And fuck the the movie The Fan, starring Wesley Snipes
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
Demolition Man's the only Snipes movie I like[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And fuck liking shit. I don't even like the stuff that I like[/tab]
Don't give a fuck about not liking all the shit I don't like
Like tissues. Fuck them! I blow my nose on the couch
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]E[/ch]
And fuck my nostrils and my sense of smell, I breathe through my mouth[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Don't give a fuck about seeing bitch, fuck my eyes[/tab]
Fuck physical perception yo, I'd rather be blind
Fuck time, seconds are too short and minutes are a joke
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]
And hours are way too long, they should be half an hour at most[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And fuck coasts, who gives a fuck about where water meets land[/tab]
And fuck boats, just because you float you think you're so fucking bad
And fuck jokes, I don't need to be funny all the time
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]
My dog has a tumor and he's probably gonna die, but...[/tab]

Chorus- [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Walked into a coffee shop and ordered a cup[/tab]
The girl says "small, medium, large?"
I say "bitch, I don't give a fuck"
She said "I can't process your order if you don't pick a size"
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                                           [ch]E[/ch]
I said "fine, I'll take a large, but I still don't give a fuck, alright?"[/tab]

etcetera etcetera, the lyrics are all below, but the chord rhythm is exactly the same.

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Don't give a fuck about beverage size options motherfucker[/tab]
And I don't give a fuck about liquids either
They're all wet and shit and tend to spill all over the place
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]
Like human semen when I get it all over my face[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I'm not gay, I just don't give a fuck about straight sex[/tab]
And fuck my dick, I'll pee and cum out of my mouth instead.
Fuck biological functions, fuck the human body
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]
I prefer the body of a bat with the head of a coyote[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I call myself Batyote and I fight crime at night[/tab]
I know it's similar to Batman but motherfuck copyright
I plagiarize all the time, I do it every day
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
Cause I'm on the right track baby, I was born this way[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And fuck birth, entering the world of space and time is a bitch[/tab]
Searching for purpose in the random universe sucks dick
Is it deterministic or am I free to choose my way
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]E[/ch]
Did I choose to not give a fuck about ice cube trays[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
If I want ice I'll go to the fucking corner store and buy a bag[/tab]
Filling you up and waiting for the water to freeze is a motherfucking drag
You know what? Fuck the word fuck, I don't need to use it
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
I'll replace it with the word chainsaw for this chorus[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
(I don't a give a chainsaw...)[/tab]
About anything, chainsaw everyone and chainsaw everything, what
(I don't give a chainsaw...)
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
I literally don't give a chainsaw about anything[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
If there was a contest to see who doesn't give a fuck the most[/tab]
I wouldn't win cause I don't give a fuck about winning yo
I don't even give a fuck about not giving a fuck,
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
so I do give a fuck... wait, what?[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
(I give a fuck...)[/tab]
About everything, I love everyone and care about everything
(I give a fuck...)
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
I literally care about every motherfucking thing[/tab]

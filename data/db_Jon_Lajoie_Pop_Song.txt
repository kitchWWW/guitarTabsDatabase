This is really for fun. I don't even believe this has any guitar parts in it, but 
for messing around with friends, or just hangin', I'd do it like this...

Almost the whole song is:

[ch]C[/ch] ([ch]Am[/ch])

The exception is:
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Now Im singing with my gay voice[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C/B[/ch]
To let you know that Im sensitive[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Oh yeah Im singing with my gay voice[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C/B[/ch]
girls love a sensitive boy, and you know I wanna-[/tab]


And the n it goes back into the original C structure

Adding in an A minor is optional for a quick transition if you are just playing for your 
friends, but overall, it's very simple and fun.

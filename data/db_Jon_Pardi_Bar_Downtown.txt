[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]Am7[/ch]
I could be just one neon sign away[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]Am7[/ch]
You could be sipping on tonic and Tanqueray[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
For all I know you could be staring at your phone[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Am7[/ch]
Like I'm staring at the clock on the wall[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                                          [ch]Am7[/ch]
Just two empty glasses hoping for the same last call[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Are you somewhere in a bar downtown?[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am7[/ch]
Thinking about me baby, drinking about me baby[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Am I heavy on your heart right now?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am7[/ch]
Like you are on mine, wishing we could rewind just a little[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Laughing at the strangers[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Am7[/ch]
When they ask you your sign or your name?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Are you turning them down 'cause you're thinking about?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                            [ch]Am7[/ch]
You and me and you wondering if I'm hanging around[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
Somewhere in a bar downtown[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                             [ch]Am7[/ch]
Are you watching that door like I been watching that door all night?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]                                                  [ch]Am7[/ch]
Are you acting like I'm acting just acting like it's all alright?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Are you going to different places?[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]Am7[/ch]
Just trying to find my face somewhere in every crowd[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
Or have you come to the conclusion that this over us illusion[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am7[/ch]
Just ain't working out[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]

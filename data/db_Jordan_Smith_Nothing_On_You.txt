[tab][ch]E#m[/ch]
There goes a piece of my past[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Won't lie kinda takes me back[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
Yeah, I maybe should have introduced you[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]
But we don't know each other like we used to[/tab]
[tab][ch]E#m[/ch]
You wanna know who she is to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
You're wondering if we got history[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
It was a really long time ago[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]
But I'll tell you anything you wanna know[/tab]
[tab][ch]E#m[/ch]                   [ch]B[/ch]
Cause it was nothing, girl you're something[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]               [ch]D#[/ch]
she could never be[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]F#[/ch]
Like a raindrop to a storm[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]B[/ch]
Like a candle to a star[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E#m[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]
Oh I promise she's got nothing on you[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F#[/ch]
Got nothing on the way you touch my soul[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]B[/ch]
Just like finding my way home[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E#m[/ch]                     [ch]B[/ch]
She was fiction baby you're my truth[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F#[/ch]    [ch]B[/ch]   [ch]E#m[/ch]    [ch]B[/ch]
She's got nothing on you, you, you, you[/tab]

[tab] [ch]E#m[/ch]
Trust me it's safe to say[/tab]
[tab] [ch]B[/ch]
It's pretty much like night and day[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F#[/ch]
I was alive but I was hardly breathing[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]
Now you can almost hear my heart beating[/tab]
[tab] [ch]E#m[/ch]                        [ch]B[/ch]
Beating just like a drum, like it's never done[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F#[/ch]                               [ch]D#[/ch]
It's unfair to compare you to anyone[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]F#[/ch]
Like a raindrop to a storm[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]B[/ch]
Like a candle to a star[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E#m[/ch]                      [ch]B[/ch]
Oh I promise she's got nothing on you[/tab]

[tab]                     [ch]F#[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]    [ch]E#m[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]
She's got nothing on you, you, you, you[/tab]

[tab] [ch]E#m[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]                     [ch]F#[/ch]

[tab]             [ch]D#[/ch]

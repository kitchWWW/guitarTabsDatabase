[tab][ch]G#[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]G#[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
It's the little things that get me high[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
Won't you come with me and spend the night?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
Just a little thing for you and I[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
And if it's meant to be then that's alright[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
It's the little things that get me high[/tab]

Won't you come with me and spend the night?[/tab]

[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]B[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]B[/ch]
With you, it's such a sweet escape[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]
So if we leave will anybody notice?[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]B[/ch]
If you don't want to play these games[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]B[/ch]
Just tell me what you need and we can go there[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Only here for the weekend[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]B[/ch]
I've just stepped out with my friends[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]A[/ch]
Don't tell me that you're leaving[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Think I came at the right time[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]B[/ch]
Do you know what's on my mind?[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]
Can you stay for the evening?[/tab]

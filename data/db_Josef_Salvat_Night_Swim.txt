Swim Swim Swim Swim[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
   Take off your clothes, the water is warm[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
I wanna take you for a night swim[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
   Believe what you want, there's no one around[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Don't play games, just get in[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
Oh I spent all my money on this view[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
So I could be alone, lost with you[/tab]

[Pre Chorus]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
   Dig your nails into my back[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
No you can't know what this means[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Dm[/ch]
You're used to getting everything you want[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
But you're the only thing that's come my way for free[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Whisper words into my ears, will you[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
As we dissolve in the breeze[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
You're taking me back to the start[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
With you I forget who I've been, I'm clean[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
I know that it's late but wait,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
A-wait, I'll drive you home[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
Just stay a little longer and swim[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
With me in this rooftop pool[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
I know that it's late but wait,[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
   Happiness saves its bite till the end[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
It never lasts forever[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
   And sometimes I think I'd be better off[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Out of this city all together[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
Still I spent all my money on this view[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Cuz none of that shit matters up here with  you[/tab]

Verse 
 

[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Sometimes, I crave an old-fashioned adventure.[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
Yeah, sometime away from day to day to get ya.[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
Needed some kind of break,[/tab]

[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Like a hammock in the shade.[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
I've got this spot where it don't get much better.[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]
Yeah, it's cold, it gets hot; I don't worry 'bout the weather.[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Am7[/ch]
My private paradise don't fit the classifieds.[/tab]

[tab][ch]Fadd9[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch] 
Vacation at my side every day and every night.[/tab]

 
Chorus:        


[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                       
Hawaii's got big breaks; Michigan, Great Lakes;[/tab]

[tab][ch]Fadd9[/ch]
Colorado snowflakes, Georgia peaches.[/tab]

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch] 
Louisiana hot food, New York attitude, Florida beaches.[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               
Tennessee whiskey; Baby, are you with me?[/tab]

[tab][ch]Fadd9[/ch]
Texas chili, Virginia pine.[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
It's hard to beat that California sunshine.[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]Fadd9[/ch]         
Baby, you're my favorite,[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Favorite state of mind.[/tab]

 

[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
It feels just like I've died and gone to Heaven.[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
Your lips, your eyes, hell everything gets me revvin'.[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Am7[/ch]
You're fearless and you're fun; thirty flavors all in one.[/tab]

[tab][ch]Fadd9[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch] 
Crazy, happy, laughin' at me, all that and then some.[/tab]

[Bm] If I need to be [A] curious
I'll [Bm] hold it [A] back
[Bm] If I need to be [A] serious
I'll [Bm] spout it [A] out
[Bm] Last year was the [A] best I [Bm] ever [A] had
[Bm] Last year was the [A] best I [Bm] sold you [A] that
[D] Now I hear that voice again
It's like [Bm] some [A] one's listening
I [Bm] know that you're [A] there
It's like [Bm] some [A] one's listening
I [Bm] know that you're [A] there
If you're [Bm] not in this [A] world once [E] again
[Bm] Watch the way you [A] backstroke across the [Bm] room
Arms [A] out, float[Bm]ing
It con [A] sumes me
You [Bm] haunt in you're [A] trail
[Bm] Last year was the [A] best I [Bm] ever [A] had
[Bm] Last year was the [A] best I [Bm] sold you [A] that
[D] Now I hear that voice again...
It's like [Bm] some [A] one's listening
I [Bm] know that you're [A] there
It's like [Bm] some [A] one's listening
I [Bm] know that you're [A] there
If you're [Bm] not in this [A] world once [E] again

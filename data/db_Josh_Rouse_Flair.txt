I figured this tab out today. It's very simple but not yet on the internet though. So 
it is.
Flair by Josh Rouse, on 'Dressed up like Nevada' album.

The Chords:
[tab]	C#min	[ch]Fsus[/ch]	[ch]G[/ch]
e|	0 (4)	0	2[/tab]
B|	0 (5)	0	2 (4)
G|	6	2	4
D|	6	2	4
A|	4	0	2
E|	x	x	x

Be aware that the drums make the music in this song for the most part. The guitar is 
limited in its presence,just really putting down some chords to get the melody going.

Intro (in 4 bars of 4 beats):

|C#min (strum 4 times)| Asus (strum 2 times)| Asus (Let ring)| Asus (let ring)|
	=> Repeat this structure in the whole song


With the Lyrics:
[tab]|C#min | [ch]Fsus[/ch] | [ch]Fsus[/ch] | [ch]Fsus[/ch] |
	 If You want me to, I[/tab]

[tab]|C#min | [ch]Fsus[/ch] | [ch]Fsus[/ch] | [ch]Fsus[/ch] |
 will      The older I get, I[/tab]

[tab]|C#min | [ch]Fsus[/ch] | [ch]Fsus[/ch] | [ch]Fsus[/ch] |
spill life    And I lived there[/tab]

[tab]|C#min | [ch]Fsus[/ch] | [ch]Fsus[/ch] | [ch]Fsus[/ch] |
six months The past is all I'm[/tab]

[tab]|C#min | [ch]Fsus[/ch] | [ch]Fsus[/ch] | [ch]Fsus[/ch] |
driven for            I'm[/tab]

[tab]|C#min | [ch]Fsus[/ch] | [ch]Fsus[/ch] | [ch]Fsus[/ch] |
driven for[/tab]

Bridge:
|  [ch]G[/ch]   |C#min | [ch]Fsus[/ch] | [ch]Fsus[/ch] | => 2 times


=> And then again to the intro pattern. With the following lyrics:

And I can't recall a name
Faces are the same to me
The same you see
And I would fake it for you
There's no where near the truth to say
The truth to say

=> The next part is played with the bridge pattern:
Silly simple lies
They made a human being
Out of you
And I can sympathize
I've always been the one that's there with you
Don't
Lose that
Flair
Don't (and I can sympathize)
Lose that (I've always been the one that's there)
Flair (for you)
If you want me to, I will (flair)
Flair
Flair
Flair
Want me to

That's all folks!

Artist: Josh Rouse
Song: Life
Genre: 
Key: F#m


Hi, this is my first tab based upon tstein69's one. His is a great tab but I feel it is played on another
position of the fretboard. This is my version. I also include general chords to play on acoustic.

I think this is one of the most beautiful songs to play on acoustic: simple, clean, beautiful lyrics and I
think Josh Rouse deserves it. Great mate!!

Use only strings one, two and three:

[tab]         [ch]Amaj7[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]Amaj7[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]Amaj7[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]F#m[/ch]
e|--------4--4-4-4-4---4------4--4---------4--4---7--4--------4-4--4----4------4----------2--|
B|-----5--5--5-5-5-5-----7-5--5--5------5--5----7----5-----5--5-5--5------7-5--5------5---2--|
G|-4/6----6--6-6-6-6----------4--4--4/6----6---------4-4/6----6-6--6-----------4--4/6-----2--|
D|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
A|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
E|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|[/tab]

And start all over again througout the whole song (more or less) The strumming of the chords might not be
100% accurate as it is quite hard to write this down. Listen to the song and you'll find out.

LYRICS
------

If I wrote it in your letter then it don't mean shit.
I am a liar, a dirty wire.
You could name my body, but it'll make you sick.
You have a savior, it's your, your heart of anger.

But my dog ain't nothin', he ain't nothin' like my lover.
Ain't nothin' like my lover at all.
He will sit upon my shoulder, let the dark day cover,
the dark day cover me up.

I got two half dollars underneath my bed.
One for my baby, one for the lady
on the sixth floor found me when my mind was dead.
Buy what they tell you, but I'm, I'm here to save you.

But my dog ain't nothin', he ain't nothin' like my lover.
Ain't nothin' like my lover at all.
He will sit upon my shoulder, let the dark day cover,
the dark day cover me up.

I heard a lady singing, "we're all bound together."
La-la-la-la-la.
I joined her side by saying, "to dance beneath the heavens."
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

Christ, your mother's hanging on my bedroom door.
I'll bet she's pretty, Queen of the City.
If you burn all sinners, I may join your corps,
sing, "holy, holy," till' my, my day of glory.

But my Lord, you ain't nothin', you ain't nothin' like my lover.
Ain't nothin' like my lover at all.
You will sit upon my shoulder, let the dark day cover,
the dark day cover me up.

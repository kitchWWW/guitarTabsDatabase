[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]
I been making a list of words that hurt[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch] 
'Cause it reminds me of what they're worth[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                       [ch]F[/ch]
I can always delete them, I can always ignore[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]F[/ch]
'Cause they're just words, they can't hurt me[/tab]

It's not what they're for


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                                 [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
But I heard that you've been writing some more[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
And I don't really know what for[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]  
And apparently they're supposed to hurt me way down deep inside[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
But they don't[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
Well at least you tried[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
So don't you call me a BTEC Lily Allen[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
Say I've got no Goddamn talent[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
That my songs should only be played in a pub[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]
And that my biggest fan is my mum[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
Well I quite like Lily Allen[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
And I don't believe in God-given talent[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
The pub is the best place that I'll ever play[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
And my mum's support is what I need anyway[/tab]


[Refrain]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Do do do do do[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Do do do do do[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Do do do do do do do do do[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]F[/ch]
And those aren't even the worst of it[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]F[/ch]
Apparently I've got where I've got because I've got tits[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                                                [ch]F[/ch]
And someone once exclaimed while we were writing a song[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]
"Oh God, Jesus, Lord, this is so basic, where did I go wrong?"[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Well I heard that you've been writing some more[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
And I don't really know what for[/tab]
       [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]
And apparently they're supposed to hurt me way down deep inside[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
But they don't[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Well at least you tried[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
So don't you call me a BTEC Lily Allen[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
Say I've got no Goddamn talent[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
That my songs should only be played in the pub[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]

[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
Well I quite like Lily Allen[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
And I don't believe in God-given talent[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I've worked really hard to be where I am[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F5[/ch]                                          [ch]C[/ch]
And you're missing out if your mum ain't your biggest fan[/tab]


[Refrain]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
Do do do do do[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
Do do do do do[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
Do do do do do do do do do[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
I'm not very creative[/tab]

My vibe is over done
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
The look just isn't working[/tab]

Stop talking about the pub
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Your pitching isn't perfect[/tab]

Your glasses are cliche
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Good luck on your project[/tab]

I'm sure they'll be a place for you one day


[Verse 3]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Well I don't give a shit[/tab]

And you're bloody full of it
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]
And I will sing the way I want[/tab]

And I'll write songs that will be hits
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I love my local pub[/tab]

And Lily Allen is pretty great
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]
So this words mean nothing to me[/tab]

And if I fall again I will
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Get back on the stage[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
And I will sing my favourite song[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
BTEC Lily Allen[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
And I'll prove all these bastards wrong[/tab]

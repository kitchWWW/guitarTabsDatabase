[Verse]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
Woke up this morning, opened the blind[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]F[/ch]
Tried to stop yawnin', sun in my eyes[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]
Went downstairs, didn’t make my bed[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Looked in the mirror at my sleepy head[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Turned the TV on, put the kettle on for two[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]F[/ch]
It's been two months and I've forgotten you[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]G[/ch]
So I put on toast and I don’t regret[/tab]

Because kicking you out
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
Was better than sliced bread[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Yeah, I won't forget your face[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]
Especially the one when I mentioned her name[/tab]

I know that you promised me the world
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But you won't find another girl[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Like me, and also round these parts[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]
I got drunk, told the people at the pub[/tab]

Oops, that was my mistake
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But that's what happens when these...[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
These strong hearts break[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
These strong hearts break[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
These strong hearts break[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You never took me out, and now I think[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]
I know why[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]F[/ch]*
'Coz there was another girl on standby[/tab]

"I don't like her that way, she's just
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
a mate"[/tab]

I call bullshit, even strong hearts
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
break[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Yeah, I won't forget your face[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]
Especially the one when I mentioned her name[/tab]

I know that you promised me the world
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But you won't find another girl[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And I struggle with you gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
But only 'coz I can't put the washing[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
on[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]
And I don't miss you when I'm awake[/tab]

'Coz that's what happens when these…

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
These strong hearts break[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
These strong hearts break[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
These strong hearts break[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]
And I know that you’re probably[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
listening to this song[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]Dm[/ch]
And I know you're probably trying to[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
move on[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
And I guess I understand that we are no[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
more[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]Dm[/ch]
So I'll be moving on while you face the[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
fact that you're still a whore[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Yeah, I won't forget your face[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]

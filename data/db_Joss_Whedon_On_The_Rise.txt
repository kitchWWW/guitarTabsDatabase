(Dr. Horrible)
[ch]Bm[/ch] intro

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
Any dolt with half a brain[/tab]
Can see that human kind has gone insane
To the point where i don't know
If I'll upset the status quo
If I throw poison in the water main.

[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]
Listen close to everybody's heart[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]
And hear that breaking sound[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Bm[/ch]
Hopes and dreams are shattering apart[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
And crashing to the ground.[/tab]


[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I cannot believe my eyes[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
How the world's filled with filth and lies[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
But it's plain to see[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]E/G#[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
Evil inside of me  is on the rise.[/tab]

(Penny)

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Look around[/tab]
We're living with the lost and found.
Just when you feel you've almost drowned
You find yourself on solid ground

[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]Bm[/ch]
And you believe there's good in everybody's heart[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]
Keep it safe and sound.[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
With hope you can do your part[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
To turn a life around[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
I cannot believe my eyes[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
Is the world finally growing wise?[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Cause it seems to me[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]E/G#[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
Some kind of harmony  is on the rise.[/tab]

(Both: Dr Horrible first line, Penny second)

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Anyone with half a brain[/tab]
Take        it     slow

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
            Could spend their whole life howling in pain[/tab]
He looks at me and seems                         to know

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
                    Cause the dark is everywhere And Penny doesn't seem to care[/tab]
The things that I'm afraid                       to show           And suddenly

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
That soon the dark in me is all that will remain[/tab]
I feel                                 this glow

[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]
         Listen close to      everybody's heart[/tab]
And I believe there's good in everybody's heart

[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
And hear that breaking sound[/tab]
    Keep it safe   and sound

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]
Hopes and dreams are shattering apart[/tab]
    With hope you can     do your part

[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
And crashing to the ground.[/tab]
     To turn a life around.

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
I cannot believe my eyes[/tab]
I cannot believe my eyes

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
How the world's filled with filth and lies[/tab]
How the world's finally     growing   wise

[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
But it's plain to see[/tab]
                And it's plain to see

[tab]        [ch]E/G#[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Evil inside of me[/tab]
       Rapture inside of me

[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
is on the rise...[/tab]
is on the rise...

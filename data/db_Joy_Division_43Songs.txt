Love Will Tear Us Apart

When the routine bites hard
and ambitions are low
And the resentment rides high
but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways,
taking different roads
Then love, love will tear us apart
again (4)

Why is the bedroom so cold
Turned away on your side?
Is my timing that flawed,
our respect run so dry?
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through
our lives
Love, love will tear us apart again (4)

Do you cry out in your sleep
All my failings expose?
Get a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold
Is it something so good
Just can't function no more?
When love, love will tear us apart
again (4)

@SONG: Isolation

In fear every day, every evening
It calls here aloud from above
Carefully watched for a reason
Mistaking devotion and love
Surrendered to self-preservation
>From others who care for themselves
A blindness that touches perfection
Appears just like anything else -
Isolation (3)

Mother I tried, please believe me
I'm doing the best that I can,
I'm ashamed of the things
I've been put through;
I'm ashamed of the person I am
But if you could just see the beauty,
these things I could never describe
This is my one consolation
This is my wonderful prize

Colony

A cry for help, a hint of anaesthesia
The sound from broken homes,
we used to meet always here
As he lays asleep she takes him in her arms
Some things I have to do
but I don't mean you harm

I wore a careless glance
and kissed her last goodbye
Hands in the bag she packed a tear
she tries to hide
Cruel wind that howls down
to our lunacy
And leaves him standing cold
here in this colony

I can't see why
all these confrontations
I can't see why
all these dislocations
No, family life just makes me feel
uneasy
Stood alone here in this colony
In this colony (4)
Yeah, God in his wisdom
took you by the hand,
God in his wisdom made you understand (4)
In this colony (4)

A Means to an End

A legacy - so far removed
one day will be improved
Eternal rights we left behind
we were the better kind
You the same, set free too
I always looked to you (3)

We fought for good,
stood side by side
Our friendship never died,
stranger ways, the lows and highs
Our vision touched the sky
Mortal this, we parted too soon
I put my trust in you (3)

A house somewhere on foreign soil,
where aching lovers call
We stood here, our final goal,
where dogs eat and vultures eat
Permitted still, I turned to go
I put my trust in you (5) in you (3)

Heart and Soul

Instants that can still betray us
A journey that leads to the sun
Soulless and bent on destruction
Struggle between right and wrong
You take my place in the show-down
I'll observe with a pitiful eye
And humble ask for forgiveness
A request well beyond you and I
Heart and soul, one will burn (2)

An abyss that lasted creation
A circus complete with all fools
Foundations that lasted the ages
Then ripped apart at their roots
Beyond all this good the terror
The grip of a mercenary hand
When savagery returns
for good reason
There's no turning back the last stand
Heart and soul, one will burn (2)

Existence-well what does it matter
I exist on the best terms I can
The past is now part of my future
The present is well out of hand (2)
Heart and soul, one will burn (2)
One will burn, one will burn
Heart and Soul, one will burn
@SONG: Twenty-four Hours

So this is permanence -
Love shattered pride
What once was innocence,
turned on its side
A cloud hangs over me,
marks every move
Deep in the memory,
what once was love

Oh how I've realized, I wanted time
Put into perspective,
try so hard to find
Just for one moment I thought
I'd got my way
Destiny unfolded -
watched it slip away

Excessive flash points,
beyond all reach
Solitary demands for all
I'd like to keep
Let's take a ride out,
see what we can find
Valueless collection of hopes
and past desires

I never realized the lengths
I'd have to go
All the darkest corners of a sense
I didn't know
Just for one moment -
hearing someone call
Looked beyond the day in hand
There's nothing there at all

Now that I've realized how it's
all gone wrong
Got to find some therapy -
this treatment takes too long
Deep in the heart of where
sympathy held sway
Got to find my destiny before
it gets too late

Exercise One

When you're looking at life
in a strange new room
Maybe drowning soon,
Is this the start of it all?
Turn on your TV, Turn down you audiophone
Turn away from it all,
it's all getting too much
When you're looking at life, deciphering scars
Tense group all who sit
still in their cars
The lights look bright
when you reach outside
Time for one last ride
before the end of it all

The Eternal

Procession moves on, the shouting is over
Praise to the glory of loved ones
now gone
Talking aloud as they sit
round their tables
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain

Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment
Possessed by a fury
that burns from inside

Cry like a child though
these years make me older
With children my time
is so wastefully spent
Burden to keep, though their
inner communion
Accept like a curse
an unlucky deal

Laid by the gate at the foot
of the garden
My view stretches out
from the fence to the wall
No words could explain,
no actions determine
Just watching the trees
and the leaves as they fall
--

Decades

Here are the young men,
a weight on their shoulders
Here are the young men,
well where have they been?
We knocked on the doors
of hell's darker chambers
Pushed to the limits
we dragged ourselves in
Watched from the wings as
the scenes were replaying
We saw ourselves now as
we never have seen
Portrayal of the traumas and degeneration
The sorrows we suffered
and never were freed
Where have they been (4)

Weary inside, now our heats
lost forever
Can't replace the fear
or the thrill of the chase
These rituals showed up the door
for our wanderings
Opened and shut, then slammed
in our face
Where have they been (4)
--
ciao, Thorsten

Atrocity Exhibition

The silence when doors open wide
Where people could pay to see inside
For entertainment they watch
his body twist
Behind his eyes he says I still exist
This is the way, step inside (4)

In arenas he kills for a prize
Wins a minute to add to his life
But the sickness is drowned
by cries for more
Pray to God make it quick - watch him fall
This is the way, step inside (4)

This is the way (4) This is the way,
step inside
You'll see the horrors of a far-away place
Meet the architects of law
face to face
See mass murder on a scale
you've never seen
And all the ones who tried hard
to succeed
This is the way, step inside (4)

And I picked on the whims of
a thousand more
Still pursuing the path
that's been buried
For years of dead woods and jungles and
cities on fire, can't replace
or relate,
can't release or repair -
take my hand,
and I'll show you what was - it will be.

Passover

This is the crises I knew had to come
Destroying the balance
I'd kept
Doubting and settling and turning around
Wondering what will come next

Is this the role that you wanted to live
I was foolish to ask for so much
Without the protection and infancy's guard

Watching the reel as it comes to a close
Brutally taking its time
People who change for no reason at all
It's happening all of the time

Can I go on
with this chain of defence
Disturbing and pursuing my mind
Hold my count of my duties -
when all's said and done
I know that I'll lose every time

Moving along in our God giving ways
Safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles
Left with a mark on the door

Can I go on
with this chain of defence
Disturbing and purging my mind
I'll count up my duties -
when all said and done
I know that I'll lose every time

This is a crises I knew had to come
Destroying the balance
I'd kept
Turning around to the next set of lies
Wondering what will come next

Disorder

I've been waiting for a guide to come
and take me by the hand
Could these sensations make me feel
the pleasures of a normal man
New sensations bear the innocence -
leave them for another day
I've go the spirit, lose the feeling
take the shock away

It's getting faster, moving faster now,
it's getting out of hand
On the tenth floor, down the backstairs
into no-man's land
Lights are flashing,
cars are crashing,
getting frequent now
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it
out somehow

What means to you,
what means to me -
and we will meet again
I'm watching you, I watch it all
I take no pity from friends
Who is right and who can tell,
and who gives a damn right now
Until the spirit, new sensation
takes hold - then you know (3)
I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling (2)
Feeling (7)

Day of the Lords

This is the room, the start of it all
No portraits so fine, only sheets on the wall
I've seen the nights,
filled with bloodsports in vain
And the body is obtained
Where will it end? (4)

These are your friends,
from childhood for you
Who goaded you on demanded
full proof
Withdraw maiden's heart,
and do you right in
So distorted and thin, distorted and thin
Where will it end? (4)

This is the car, at the edge of the road
There's nothing disturbed,
all the windows are closed
I guess you were right,
when we talked in the heat
There's no room for the weak
no room for the weak
Where will it end? (4)

This is the room, the start of it all
Dreamt I fled from you,
I remember it all
Oh I've seen the nights, filled with
bloodsport in vain
And the body's obtained, the body's obtained
Where will it end? (4)

Insight

Guess the dream always end
They don't rise up just descend
But I don't care anymore
I've lost the will to want more
I'm not afraid, not at all
I watch them all as they fall
But I remember, when we were young

Those with habits of waste
The sense of style and the taste
Of making sure you were right
Hey, don't you know you were right
I'm not afraid anymore
I keep my eyes on the door
But I remember...

Tears and sadness for you
Awe of evil for you
Reflects a moment in time
A special moment in time
Yeah, we wasted our time
We didn't really have time
But we remember - when we were young

And all God's angels beware
And all you judges beware
Sons of chance take good care
For all the people out there
I'm not afraid anymore (4)

New Dawn Fades

Change of speed, a change of style
A change of scene, with no regrets
A chance to watch
admire the distance
Still occupied - though you forget
Different colours, different shades
Over each mistakes were made
I took the blame
Directionless, so plain to see
A loaded gun won't set you free
So you say

We'll share a drink and step outside
An angry voice and one who cried
We'll give you everything and more
The strain's too much,
can't take much more
Oh I've walked on water,
run through fire
Can't seem to feel it anymore
It was me -  waiting for me
Hoping for something more
Me - see me in this time -
Hoping for something else

She's Lost Control

Confusion in her eyes that says it all --
She's lost control
And she's clinging to the nearest passerby
She's lost control
And she gave away the secrets of her past
And said "I've lost control again."
And heard the voice that told her
when and where to act
She said "I've lost control again".

And she turned to me and took me by the hand
And said "I've lost control again"
And how I'll never know just why
or understand
She said  "I've lost control again"
And she screamed out, kicking on her side
and said "I've lost control again"
And seized up on the floor --
I thought she'd died
She said "I've lost control again"
She's lost control again --
she's lost control (2)

Well I had to phone her friend to state
her case and say she's lost control again
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes
And said "I've lost control again"
But she expressed herself in many different
ways until she'd lost control again
And walked upon the edge of no escape
and laughed "I've lost control again"
She's lost control again,
she's lost control (2)

I could live a little there
In the midst of the light
When the darkness closed in
I could have broke down and cried
I could live a little
In the white of light
When the change is gone
When the caring's gone
To lose control --
when the caring's gone

Shadowplay

To the centre of the city where all roads
meet looking for you
To the depths of the ocean
where all hopes sank searching for you
Moving through the silence without motion
waiting for you
In a room with no window in the corner,
I found truth

In the shadowplay, acting out your
own death, knowing more
As the assassins all grouped
in four lines,
Dancing on the floor,
And with cold steel, odour on their bodies,
made a move to connect
I could only stare in disbelief
as the crowds all left

I did everything, everything you wanted to
I let them use you -
for their own ends
To the centre of the city in the night
waiting for you (2)

Wilderness

I traveled far and wide through many
different times
What did you see there?
I saw all knowledge destroyed

I traveled far and wide to prisons
of the cross
What did you see there?
The power and glory of sin
What did you see there?
The blood of Christ on their skins
I traveled far and wide through many
different times

I traveled far and wide where
unknown martyrs died
I saw the one-sided trials
What did you see there?
I saw the tears as they cried
They had tears in their eyes!
Tears in their eyes! (3)

Interzone

I walked through city limits
Someone took me by the hand in the blue
Attracted by some force within it
If I could close my eyes,
I could get used to it
Around the corner where a puppet lay
Saw the place where she had a room to stay
A wire fence
where children play
Saw them dance where the body lay
And I was looking for a friend of mine
The car screeched in the sand
and dust
Feel encouraged -
just a car on it's side
Metallic blue turned red with rust
Pulled it close by the buildin's side
In a room for forgotten youth
I could think
or let my senses slide
Turned on to a night with you
Find the place where my friends, won't go
And I was looking for a friend of mine
and I had no time to lose
Yeah looking for some friends of mine
Down the dark street,
the houses looked the same
Stopped and turned around,
held me to a game
I walked round and round,
you nailed me to a tree
Trying to find a way,
trying to find a way, to get out
For twelve windows stand in a row
Behind a wall
where a room to go
The light shined like a neon show
See the deep mellow warmth
of the glow
No place to stop,
no place to go
No time to lose,
have to keep on going
I guess they died some time ago
I guess they died some time ago
And I was looking for a friend of mine
And I have no time to lose
Yeah, I was looking for a friend of mine

I Remember Nothing

We were strangers, we were strangers,
Away too long,
away too long
We were violent strangers,
away too long,
Get weak all the time,
we just passed the time
Me in my own world, yeah you there beside
The gaps only moment,
we stared from each side
We were strangers, away too long

Violent, more violent his hand
cracks the chair
Moves on reaction, then slumps,
in despair
Trapped in a cage and surrendered
too soon
Me in my own world
Away too long
We were strangers (2)
Away too long (2)

Candidate

Forced by the pressure, the territory's
marked
No longer the pleasure, Oh I've since
lost the heart
Corrupted from memory, no longer the power
It's creeping up slowly, that last
fatal hour

Oh I don't know what made me,
or what gave me the night
To mess with your values
And change wrong to right

Please keep your distance
the trail leads to here,
There's blood on your fingers,
brought on by fear
I campaigned for nothing,
I worked hard for this
I tried to get to you
you treat me like this

It's just second nature,
it's what we've been shown
We're living by your rules,
that's all that we know
I tried to get to you (3)
Oh how I tried to get to you

Ice Age

Seen the real atrocities, buried in the sand
Stockpiled safety for a few -
we stand holding hands I -
living in the iceage (2)

Nothing will hold, nothing will fit
Into the cold, no smile on your lips
Living in the iceage (3)

Searching for another way,
see them hide behind the door
Live in holes and disused shafts
hoped a little more
I - living in the iceage (2)

Nothing will hold, nothing will fit
Into the cold, no smile on your lips
Living in the iceage (3  4)

Sound of Music

See my true reflection
put out my own connections
I can see it's getting
harder, so sad is this sensation
Reverse the situation,
I can't see it getting better

I'll walk you through the heartbreak,
show you all the out-taken
I can't see it getting higher,
systematically degraded
Emotionally a scapegoat,
I can't see it getting higher

For person unrealistic,
try to make it all stick
I can see it getting harder,
all am now am burnt out
All I need's a break out,
I can't see it getting higher

Love - life don't you feel we're
higher, higher, higher
don't you feel higher, higher, etc.

Hearts fail -- young hearts fail
Anytime -- that's allright
Over here -- all the time
Take it quick -- take it neat
Cross your hands -- twist your feet
Take it quick -- take it neat (2)
Hearts fail -- young hearts fail
Anytime -- whereabout?
On the run -- on the ground
Put your hand -- where it's safe
Lay your hand -- where it's safe
And do it again
Do it again and again and again (4)

Anytime -- that's allright
Told ya we should do it again
Over here -- all the time
Told ya we should do it again (3)

The Only Mistake

Made the fatal mistake like
I did once before
Tendency just to take till
the purpose stood sour
Strain - take the strain,
these days - we learn
Strain - feel the strain,
as these days - we learn
Yeah, the only mistake was
that you ran away
Yeah, the only mistake was
that you ran away
Avenues lined with trees planned your course
for the day
Yeah, the only mistake like I made
once before
Yeah, the only mistake could have
made it before

Strain - take the strain,
these days - we learn
Strain - take the strain,
these days - we learn
And the only mistake led to rumours
and found
Led to pleasures and pain different
feelings and sounds
Yeah the only mistake like
I made once before
Yeah the only mistake could have
made it before

They Walked in Line

All dressed in uniforms so fine
They drank and killed to pass the time
Wearing the shame
of all their crimes
With measured steps they walked in line
They walked in line (8)

They carried pictures
of their wives
And number tags
to prove their lies
And made it through the whole machine
With dirty hearts and hands washed clean
They walked in line (8)

Full of a glory never seen
They made it through the whole machine
Turn never questioned anymore
Hypnotic trance
they never saw

The Kill

Moved in a hired car
and I find no way to run
Adds every moment longer
had no time for fun
Just something that I knew I had to do
But through it all
I kept my eyes on you

I had an impulse to clear it all away
I used the tactics - make everybody pay
Just something that I knew I had to do
But through it all
I kept my eyes on you

Oh I keep it all traded in
I've paid the graces there
No kidding, misuse -
no sign of blood

Just something that I knew I had to do
But through it all
I kept my eyes on you
Yeah through it all
I kept my eyes on you
But through it all
I kept my eyes on you

Something Must Break

To waste and choose or raise the dead
With pain behind go straight ahead
Room full of people grouping
as one
I can't break out now
the time just won't come

To waste and choose which way to go
Decide for me please let me know
Looked in the mirror
saw I was wrong
If I could get back to - where I belong

To waste and choose which way to go
I paused for one
whom signs forbode
If we were immortal we would not bear
Washed up on the beat here
Struggle for air
I see you face still in my window
Tormented clouds won't set me free
Something must break now -
this life isn't mine
Something must break now -
wait for the time

Dead Souls

Someone take these dreams away
That point me to another day
A duel of personalities
That stretch all true reality
And keep calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me

When figures from the past stand tall
And mocking voices ring the hall
Imperialistic house of prayer
Conquistadores who took
their share
And keep calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me

Calling me, calling me (2)
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
The keep calling me (2)

Ceremony

I've heard them all,
no mercy shown
Heaven knows it's got to be this time
What she'd heard,
these things she said
This time she cried
and failed to wait, this time

Oh I've heard them all, no mercy shown
Heaven knows it's got to be this time
Avenues all lined with trees
Pictures me and then you start watching,
watching forever (2)
Forever - watching love grow
Forever - letting me know (2)

Twenty-Four Hours (uncredited)

So this is permanence -
Love shattered pride
What once was innocence,
turned on its side
A cloud hangs over me,
marks every move
Deep in the memory,
what once was love

Oh how I've realized, I wanted time
Put into perspective,
try so hard to find
Just for one moment I thought
I'd got my way
Destiny unfolded -
watched it slip away

Excessive flash points,
beyond all reach
Solitary demands for all
I'd like to keep
Let's take a ride out,
see what we can find
Valueless collection of hopes
and past desires

I never realized the lengths
I'd have to go
All the darkest corners of a sense
I didn't know
Just for one moment -
hearing someone call
Looked beyond the day in hand
There's nothing there at all

Now that I've realized how it's
all gone wrong
Got to find some therapy -
this treatment takes too long
Deep in the heart of where
sympathy held sway
Got to find my destiny before
it gets too late

Transmission

Radio -- live transmission -- radio
live transmission
Listen to the silence, let it ring on
Eyes dark, relentless, frightened of the sun
We would have a fine time living in the night
Be left a blind destruction,
Waiting for our sight
We would go on as though nothing was
wrong
Hide from these days to remain all alone
Staying in the same place,
just staring at the tide
Touching from a distance, further all the time

Dance, dance, dance, dance,
dance to the radio (4)
Well I could call out when the going
gets tough
The things we've learned are no longer
enough
No language, just sound is all
we need know
To synchronise love to the beat
of the show
And we could dance -- dance, dance,
dance, dance, to the radio (4)

Digital

Feel it closing in, feel it closing in
A fear of whom I call,
hearing someone call
I feel it closing in, I feel it closing in
Day in, day out (6)

I feel it closing in,
As patterns seem to form
I feel it cold and warm
As shadows start to fall
I feel it closing in, I feel it closing in
Day in, day out (5)

I'd have the world to just see
whatever happens to my decorum
And then just fade away
I see you fade away, don't ever fade away
I need you here today
Don't ever fade away (4)
Fade away (7)

Leaders of Men

Born from some mother's womb --
Just like any other room
Made a promise for a new life --
Made a victim out of your life
When your time's on the door --
And you trip on the floor
And you feel you can touch --
All the noise is too much
And the seeds that are sown --
Are no longer your own
Just a minor operation --
To force the final ultimatum
A thousand words are spoken loud
Reach that gun to fool the crowds
When you walk down the street and the
sound that's so sweet
And you wish you could hide --
Maybe go for a ride
To some picture arcade --
Where the future's not made
A nightmare situation --
Infiltrate imagination
Smacks of past holy wars --
Fight a war with broken laws
The leaders of men --
Born out of your frustration
The leaders of men --
Just a strange infatuation
The leaders of men -- Made
a promise for a new life
No saviour for our sakes
To crush the atrocities of hate
Self-induced manipulation
To crush all thoughts
of mass-salvation

Warsaw

I was there in the backstage
when first light came around
I grew up like a changeling
to wait the first time around
I could see all the weakness
I could pick all the faults
But I concede all the faith-tests,
just [ch]D[/ch] stick in your throat 3 - 1 - [ch]C[/ch]

I'm around in your soundtrack,
to mirror all that you've done
To find the right side of reason
to kill the three lies for one
I could see all the cold facts,
I could see through your eyes
All this don't make no contact
no matter how hard I try
3 - 1 - [ch]C[/ch]

I could still hear the footsteps,
I could see only walls
All this don't make no contact,
here, hearing no at all
I could see contradiction,
I could give up the right
Just to live in the past tense,
To make believe you were right!

Autosuggestion

Here, here, everything is my design
Everything is my design
Here, here, everything is kept inside
So take a chance and step outside
Your hopes, your dreams, your paradise
Heroes, idols crept like ice

Here, here, everything is kept inside
So take a chance and step outside
Feel frustration face to face
A point of view creates more waste
So take a chance and step outside

Take a chance and step outside
Lose some sleep and say you've tried
Meet frustrations face to face
A point of view creates more waste
So lose some sleep
and say you've tried (4)
Say you've tried (11)
Yeah, lose some sleep
and say you've tried (4)

Atmosphere

Walk -- in silence
Don't walk away -- in silence
See the danger -- always danger
Endless talking -- life rebuilding
Don't walk away

Walk -- in silence
Don't turn away -- in silence
Your confusion -- my illusion
Worn like a mask
of self-hate
Confronts and then dies
Don't walk away

People like you -- find it easy
Aching to see -- walking on air
Hunting by rivers, through the streets,
every corner abandoned to soon
Set down with due care
don't walk away -- in silence --
Don't walk away

Failures

Don't speak with shameless face
A failure of modern man
To the centre of luck he dived
Has a hold on a nose
so red
Throw up in a hollow field
Break the image of your father's son
Drawn to an inner field
He was thought of as the only one (2)

He no longer denies
All the failures of the modern man
No, no, no we can't make sides
Sees the failures of the modern man
Wise words and sympathy
Tell the story of our history
New strength gives a real touch
Sense of reason make it all too much
With a strange fatality
Broke the spirits of a lesser man
Some other race could see
In his way he was the only one (2)

He no longer denies
All the failures of the modern man
No, no, no we can't make sides
See the failures of the modern man
Now that it's right to decide
In his time he was the total man
Taken from Caesar's side
Kept in silence just to prove
us wrong
He no longer denies
All the failures of the modern man
No, no, no we can't make sides
Sees the failures of the modern man
All the failures of the modern man

No, I don't know just why, No,
I don't know just why
Which way to turn, I've got this ticket
to use
Through child-like ways, rebellion and crime
To reach this point
and retreat back again
The broken hearts, all the wheels
that are turned
The memory's scarred
and the vision blurred

No, I don't know which way,
Don't know which way to turn
The best possible use -- Just passing
through 'till we reach the next stage
Just to where-well, it's all been arranged
Just passing through
but the break must be made
Should we move on
or stay safely away?
Through child-like ways, rebellion and crime
To reach this point
and retreat back again
The broken hearts, all the wheels
that are turned
The memory's scarred
and the vision blurred
Just passing through
'till we reach the next stage
But just to where-well, it's all been arranged
Just passing through
but the break must be made
Should we move on
or stay safely away?

Novelty

When the people listen to you don't you
know it means a lot 'cos you've got to
work so hard for everything you've got
Can't rest on your laurels now
Not when you've got none
You'll find yourself in a gutter
Right back where you came from

Someone told me being in the know
is the main thing
We all need the security
that belonging brings
Can't stand on your own in these times
against all the odds
You all just fall behind like all
the other sods

You slap your back
and pretend you knew about
all the things that we were gonna do
What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do
when it's over?
You're all on your own now,
Don't you think that's a shame
But you're the only one responsible
to take the blame
So what ya gonna do when the novelty
has gone
Yeah, what ya gonna do when the novelty
has gone
You slap your backs
and pretend you knew about
all the things we were gonna do
What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do
When its over?

Komakino

This is the hour when the mysteries emerge
Strangeness so hard to reflect
A moment so moving goes straight
to your heart
Condition that's never been met
The attraction that's held like a wake
deep inside
Something I'll never forget
Pattern is set, the reaction will start
Complete but rejected too soon
Looking ahead in the grip of each tear
Impulse that blinds every move
Shadow that stood by the side of the road
Always reminds me of you
How can I find the right way
to control
All the conflicts inside,
All the problems beside
As the questions are right,
and the answers don't fit
Into my way of paying, into my way
of paying

These Days

Morning seems strange, almost out of place
Searched hard for you and your special ways
These days -- please stay
Spent all my time,
learnt to kill is hard
Took threats and abuse
till I'd lived apart
Can you stay -- for these days?
These days -- these days
Use hard-worn deception to get away
Broken heart romance
to make it pay
These days -- these days
We'll tread through it all
This modern age
Take care of it all now these debts
are paid
Can you stay -- for these days?

No Love Lost

So long sitting here --
Didn't here the warning
Waiting for the tape to run
We've been moving round in different
situations
Knowing that the time would come
Knowing that the time would come
Just to see you torn apart --
witness to your empty heart
I need it (3)

Through the wire screen the eyes
of those standing outside
locked in at her as if into the cage
of some rare creature in a zoo.
In the hand of one of the assistants she saw
the same instrument which they had that
morning inserted deep
into her body.
She shuddered instinctively.
No life at all in the House
of Dolls. No love lost (3)

You've been seeing things in darkness --
Running, learning
Hoping that the truth will pass
No life underground
Wasting, never changing
Wishing that this thing won't last
To never see you show your age
To watch the feeling fades
I need it

The Drawback (or All of this for You)

Seen the troubles and the evils of this world
I've seen the stretches between
godliness and sin
I've had the promise and confessions
of true faith
And the hypocrisy that always lies within
And they left it for you --
all of this for you (2)

I've seen the products
and the other world of waste
I've seen the colour of corruption
deep within
I've seen them lose themselves
in dignity and taste
To see in black and white and through
to black again
And they left it all for you --
all of this for you (2)

And they left it for you --
all of this for you
And they left it for you -- everything for you
I've seen the troubles and the evils
of this world
I've seen the ones who can succeed
but always lose
I've seen what's left
of poor technology and work
And watched them dying as they
leave their ship of fools
And they left it for you --
all of this for you

feel it cutting into me the doubting painful knife, 
feel deepening the rift finally just hit just right 
couldn't take the love I had so weak and burning low 
but it grew into that pain hurting me this i know

its non fiction 


[verse 1]

so good with numbers, science, math I like
but terrible at english so I despise
this part of me that wants a simple right or wrong
and i feel that everything I choose will always be false

and today this homework about me a blank sheet
accomplished, content with, this life I will now live
Till I think why are we sometimes, no always, 
saying how we're sad and how we're lonely





can you even read the blackboard written as clear as can be?
can you even read his mind see that kids lost fantasy?
can you even find the one who dyed his red heart to black?
hey who could it be? hey someone tell me!

can you even solve the question with your abacus yet?
can you even stop the rope from hanging him by his neck?
do we really choose it right saying we're okay this way?
hey just tell me how
it's not like i care now

[verse]
Counting days like numbers, they all pass their prime
And again hypnotically swimming through time
Behind the power and guards I put up
I hide knowing they had long died
From problems, my resolve
Just can't solve that homework
Accomplished
Content with this life I will now live
'Til I think and he speaks
That demon inside us
Saying, "Let me just leave"
Saying, "Someone kill me!"


 

Can you even read the blackboard written clear as can be?
Can you even read his mind? See that kid's lost fantasy?
Can you even find the one who dyed his red heart to black?
Hey, who could it be? Hey, someone tell me!

Can you even solve the question with your abacus yet?
Can you even stop the rope from hanging him by his neck?
Did we really choose it right saying we're okay this way?
Hey, just tell me how! Hey, just tell me how!


[bridge]

Can you even say the formula of area now?
Can you even scream the dreams you swore would never go out?
Who was the one who let my hopes just curl up and die?
Hey, who could it be? No, it's gotta be

Just open up your eyes, why don't you grow up and see?
But what the hell is growing up and tell me when will I be?
Can a single person out there, just explain it to me?
Hey, just tell me how! It's not like I care now!

 And if you wed another [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
I will have to kill you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch] 
Both in bed my lover[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]        [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
I would rather see you[/tab]
...  
Dead and under covers 
Than in front of the world 
Exposing for all others
Skin in which I curled

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch] 
I would be your Indian Lover [/tab]
I would be your Indian Lover
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]  
I would be your Indian Lover Boy[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]
Feel my joy [/tab]

And if you touch a man 
Than you can fully expect 
I will abort my plan to woo you 
So circumspect 
I'll cross the gates of hell and sell 
What is left then of my soul 
And in exchange 
I'll lay away my dying role 

I would be your Indian Lover 
I would be your Indian Lover
I would be your Indian Lover Boy
Feel my joy 

[tab][ch]B[/ch]                       
Ascetic discipline [/tab]
And caked in mud 
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch] (barred)
I would go down to the river[/tab]
Wading in, controlling the flood 
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Not even a stitch on me [/tab]
No where 
No stitch leather on my back 
[tab][ch]C[/ch] (barred)
Until I knew which one was better [/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch] (barred)
The love or the lacking[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]...  
And if you go at last and leave me here[/tab]
I will slowly run the gas entombed
And then invisible 
And fingering the match 
I'll strike one mortal final blow 
For every fool dispatched 
I'll retire in my pyring inferno

I would be your Indian Lover 
I would be your Indian Lover 
I would be your Indian Lover Boy
feel my joy
I'd be your Indian Lover 
I would be your Indian Lover 
I would be your Indian Lover Boy
Feel my joy

[ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab]                    [ch]Dm[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
Living in Kansas, a life alone[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
She never married, she’s hardly known[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Dm[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
She stares out the window, far away[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
Looking for another windy day[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Dorothy was a fool to leave, she should have stayed[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
She had it right in her hands, she had it made[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Dm[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
She could have had it all for keeps, she was afraid[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]
She could have stayed[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]                  [ch]Dm[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]
It seems like only yesterday[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
But forty years have all but slipped away[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]
Since a lonely black haired girl[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
Was taken for her one and only whirl[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Dorothy was a fool to leave, she could have stayed[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
She had it right in her hands, she had it made[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Dm[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
She could have had it all for keeps, but was afraid[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]
She could have stayed[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
Same old bluebird flying high[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
Over rainbows in that Kansas sky[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
Why, oh why[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
Oh why___[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]               [ch]Dm[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
I guess it only serves her right[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
For trading all that colour for black and white[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Dm[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
All her sorrow, all because[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
There ain’t no way to stand Kansas when you’ve been to Oz[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Dorothy was a fool to leave, she should have stayed[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
She had it right in her hands, she had it made[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Dm[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
She could have had it all for keeps, she was afraid[/tab]

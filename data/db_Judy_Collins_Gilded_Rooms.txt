[Verse 1]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
We sat in gilded rooms of fine old glass[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
The light from candles dancing on the walls[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
She sang me the songs she'd written in her sorrow[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]Asus2[/ch]
And told me she'd be dead and gone tomorrow[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
She learned to sing and paint in her own blood[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
As it dripped upon the strings of her guitar[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
She found a blade of steel in the silver flood[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
And tore her friends and fingernails apart[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
She thought perhaps that she would marry soon[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
The lover who would set her heart on fire[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
The one she chose under the waning moon[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]A[/ch]
She ground them down as every flame burned higher[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
And it's only time will tell and time alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
What is meant when all is set in stone[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
Who will ride one day on the shining horse[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Who will win and who will stay the course[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
He was the wrangler of some famous men[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
He was the star of every stage he crossed[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
He was the mountain he would have to move[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
For he was never found and never lost[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
They met when he was thirty years of age[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Already at his peak and at a loss[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
Joan of Arc had crossed his path so early[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
And he had borne the dagger and the cross[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
And it's only time will tell and time alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
What is meant by all this skin and bone[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
Who will ride off on the shining horse[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Who will win and who will stay the course[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
He said, I'd really like to study love[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Taking both her hands between his own[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
He heard the singing of the mourning dove[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
And felt his soul was ready to atone[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
The girl with hair of gold and heart of steel[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
In time her past and future would begin[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
She wept in caves and watched the turning wheel[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
And lost as often as she failed to win[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
And it's only time will tell and time alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
What is meant by all this skin and bone[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
Who will ride off on the shining horse[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Who will win and who will stay the course[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
The man who wrote the poems of ash and blood[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
All the saints were dancing to his rhymes[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
He had the gift of purest, truest love[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
He had the cure for each and every crime[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
And it's only time will tell and time alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
What is meant when all set in stone[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
Who will ride off on the shining horse[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Who will win and who will stay the course[/tab]

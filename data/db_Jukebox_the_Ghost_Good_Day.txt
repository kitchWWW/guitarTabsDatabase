Artist: Jukebox the Ghost
Song: Good Day
Genre: 
Key: 


This song is originally for piano. It's mostly just a Bb chord throughout with changing notes on the left hand
I'm going to write the chords with the left hand notes just in the intro and simplify for the verses, but it's
the same line for the Bb intro and verses. Have fun!!

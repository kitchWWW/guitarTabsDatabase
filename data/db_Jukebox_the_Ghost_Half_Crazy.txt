Artist: Jukebox the Ghost
Song: Half Crazy
Genre: 
Key: 


These are the open chords for Half Crazy. It's all pretty straightforward, which 
is why I haven't written out every single verse and such. They're useful for 
coming up with fun picking patterns for this song, particularly on an acoustic 
guitar. And yes, I know the words and chords aren't aligned properly; I typed it 
up hastily. The locations of the changes are obvious, though. E-mail me at 
elisemeltaus@gmail.com with any inquiries.

Verses all go thusly:
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
           When you were locked up in your room alone[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
           Neglecting even just to touch the phone[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
           Salty tears rolling down your cheeks[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
           Like they had many times before[/tab]

Choruses all go thusly:
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]AM[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
             I've gone half crazy worried about you  about you[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]AM[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
             My left eye's gone lazy worried about you about you[/tab]

Bridge goes thusly
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
            Every word you say is self directed and I think that that is tragic[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                                          [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
            And every time you open up your mouth to speak, it's self-referenced and that's tragic[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
            You don't have to see the world to know it's true[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
            You don't have to see the world to know that it keeps turning[/tab]

Artist: Jules Paymer
Song: 25
Genre: 
Key: 


i really don’t know what the original key of the song is;
i like to play it with a capo on 1
so i do know this doesn’t match the track exactly, but it works
and if anyone can figure out the chords on the track from this information, that’s fantastic

this is my first time writing a tab that i’ve just kinda guessed chords on,
so fair warning some of its guaranteed to be wrong

that being said, it’s pretty simple with only a few chords so good for beginners

[intro instrumental]
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]Cadd9[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Abby planned her wedding[/tab]

in a science notebook during class
[tab]        [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
and John would be in the Olympics[/tab]

cause no one else could run that fast
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
and Hailey was the smartest,[/tab]

so her dad bought her a Harvard shirt
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
    but i wasn’t making plans like they were[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]
i was trying just to make it through[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
another day another fight[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
cause why would i have thought ahead[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
if i was always gonna die[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
i pushed away my friends and sister[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
missed my prom cause i just figured[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
i’d never see another sight[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
but now i’m here and changed my mind, but[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
i don’t know how to live[/tab]

now that i wanna be alive
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
cause i never really saw me[/tab]

living past 25 (… 25)

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
i was busy hiding[/tab]

and changing who i was to fit
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
see if anyone would buy it[/tab]

cause god knows that i never did

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
growing up took a long time[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
but the rest of life is longer[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
and the second i made it mine[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
it stopped getting harder, but[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
i don’t know how to live[/tab]

now that i wanna be alive
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
cause i never really saw me[/tab]

living past 25 (… 25)

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
i can see a world where candles[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
on a cake are not a countdown[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
the friends i make will stick around[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
i’ll look at my face and actually feel proud[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
watch my sister’s kids grow older,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
fall in love, let my heart break[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
no matter where i’m go i[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
know i’m not going away, but[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
i don’t know how to live[/tab]

now that i wanna be alive
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
cause i never really saw me[/tab]

living past 25 (… 25)

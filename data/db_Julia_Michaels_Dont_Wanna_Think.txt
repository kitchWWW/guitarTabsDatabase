[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Now I'm not really one for drinking songs but[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I guess that I should probably write one 'cause[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I'm feeling pretty lonely[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
He's the only thing that holds me right now[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Now I'm not really one for drinking songs but[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I guess if I'm not wrapped here in your arms then[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I can't talk about love[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And who wants to talk about love?[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]
I don't want us[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                          [ch]F[/ch]
Well, I don't wanna think about you right now[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Don't wanna think about you right now[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
'Cause if I did, it would be damn bad[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
And I'd show up at your house[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]F[/ch]
I was screaming at your door[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Saying "what the fuck is wrong with you?"[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
I thought that we were good enough[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
I thought that you needed love[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]F[/ch]
No, I don't wanna think about you right now[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
Don't wanna think about you right now[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Now I'm not really one for drinking songs but[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Fuck it, here it comes, uh[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Heartbreak is annoying[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And I feel it in the morning[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Swallow it down like a bitter pill[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
At least it'll taste better than this feeling will[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                                   [ch]C[/ch]
And I don't like myself when I'm just standing still[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                        [ch]F[/ch]
No, I don't wanna think about you right now[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Don't wanna think about you right now[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
'Cause if I did, it would be damn bad[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
And I'd show up at your house[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]F[/ch]
I was screaming at your door[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Saying "what the fuck is wrong with you?"[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
I thought that we were good enough[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
I thought that you needed love[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]
I know that when I wake up[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]C[/ch]
There's gonna be seven texts and three calls to you[/tab]

And I'm not gonna know what to do
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
And I'll make up some excuse about[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
How that was meant for someone else[/tab]

When the truth is I'm not over you

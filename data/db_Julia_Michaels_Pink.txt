He's got a thing for fitness, seven days a week[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
But I don't really care unless he's working out with me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
He's got a thing for flowers, but only certain kinds[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]
And by certain kinds I mean, only if it's mine[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]
Don't get enough, he don't get enough[/tab]

I don't get enough, he don't get enough of me[/tab]

He don't get enough, I don't get enough[/tab]

(N.C.)
There's no innuendos, it's exactly what you think
Believe me when I tell you that he loves the color pink
Ah

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
We get palpitations when the week is slow[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
Yeah baby we get anxious mostly on the days we don't[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
Use physics to fit in our love[/tab]

Use physics to fit in our love[/tab]

Open up your mind[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
Wanna walk through the corridors and open doors[/tab]

Everything I Need" by Julia Poe â€“ Guitar Tab (Key of F#) This is the first guitar tab for "Everything I
Need" by Julia Poe is in the key of F# major, played without a capo. Transposition Tip If you'd like to play
this song in the key of E minor, you can transpose the tab up by 10 half-steps (or one full step and a

i'm pretty confident of the accuracy of this tab - i've put a lot of time
into it, watched a video of paul playing it, and even slowed the tempo for
part of it (specifically figure 4) to make sure it's correct. however, if
you have any corrections, please comment. also, if you know the names of the
chord forms used for these figures, please comment those as well - i don't
really know how to identify chords yet, but i know their forms are how most
people identify picking patterns like these, so it would help a lot for more
experienced players.

two youtube videos are useful in learning this song, hopefully they're still
up, if not try to find video similar to their description:

this video has the album version of the song. any time stamps found in this
tab are meant to match up with the timeline in this video.

this is a video of paul playing the song. both of paul's hands are visible
throughout the majority of the video so it's an excellent reference in case
you get stuck.

here is the order in which the figures are played throughout the song:

GUITAR 1
11112233 x 8 [00:00 - 1:09]
4411533 x 2 [1:09 - 1:22]
1111 x 2 [1:22 - 1:30]
11112233 x 6 [1:30 - 2:21]
4411533 x 2 [2:21 - 2:33]
1111 x 2 [2:33 - 2:42]
66667777 x 10 [2:42 3:32]
6 x 1 [3:32 - 3:41]

GUITAR 2
88889999 x 10 [2:42 - 3:32]
10 x 1 [3:32 - 3:41]

the first three quarters of the song (up to 2:42) use only figures 1-5. the
intro uses only figures 1-3 so start by practicing these figures.

as you can see, the only difference between these three figures is the note
played on the a string. i use my index finger for figure 1, my pinky for
figure 2, and of course nothing for the open a on figure 3. repeat this
process eight times.

after the first couple verses, switch to figure 4 by sliding on the d string
from the 7th fret to the 9th. switch back to the chord form from figure 2
right before this part, as figure 4 uses the same form. the picking pattern
for figure 4 is slightly different than the pattern from figures 1-3. after
playing figure 4 twice, slide back down on the d string to the 7th fret and
play figure 1 once. then play figure 5, which is like a combination of
figures 3 and 2, in that order. after playing figure 5 you should be in
position for figure 2; play this figure twice, then repeat the process once
more.

at 1:22, simply play figure 1 eight times, then return to the same figures
1-3 pattern from the first part of the song, but this time only play it six
times. after that, play the same instrumental segment from 1:09 - 1:22 twice
like last time, then play figure 1 eight more times. this is the last time
you'll play any of figures 1-5 in the song, so now we move onto the outro.

the rest of the song is an intro in which you alternate between figures 6
and 7. once again, this is yet another different couple of picking patterns,
so study the tabs and practice to get them right. just alternate between
playing figure 6 four times then figure 7 four times, and repeat the process
ten times, which is when the song ends.

at 2:42, a second guitar comes in. just like guitar 1, it's the same tab
over and over for the rest of the song until the very end. play figure 8
four times then figure 9 four times a total of ten times, then end with
figure 8.

lyrics:
On the Esplanade, down by the sea
Baby, watch my back
I think somebody’s been following me
You feel overcome, with trying to play it dead
You feel safe that way, is it better than just playing instead?
It was a big step for me to roll up my golden life
Should have saved, saved my energy

I’m awake today
It’s so nice to see the windows wash my dreams away
And I prop myself up on my pillow
We’ve been through shaky times
But I’m glad you found your way
There was too much panic then
From here on it will be straight all the way
It was a big step for me to roll up my golden life
Should have saved, saved my energy

Changing with time, I can’t wait for the sign
Is this right?
Day chose your side, but the day brings the pride of the light
Oh the peace comes at night; I will never break from this shadow of exile
To be blinded
Changing with time, I can’t wait for the sign
Is this right?
Is this right?

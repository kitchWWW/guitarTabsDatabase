[tab][ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
His voice was low with pain[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
I'll do your bidding comrade mine[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]
If I ride back again[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
But if you ride back and I am left[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
You'll do as much for me[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
Mother you know must hear the news[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
So write to her tenderly[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
She's waiting at home like a patient saint[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Her fond face pale with woe[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
Her heart will be broken when I am gone[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
I'll see her soon I know[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Just then the order came to charge[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
For an instance hand touched hand[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
They said aye and away they rode[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
That brave and devoted band[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
Straight was the track to the top of the hill[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
The rebels they shot and shelled[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Plowed furrows of death[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
Through the toiling ranks[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
And guarded them as they fell[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
There soon came a horrible dying yell[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
>From heights that they could not gain[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
And those who doom and death had spared[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
Rode slowly back again[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
But among the dead that were left on the hill[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Was the boy with the curly hair[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
The tall dark man who rode by his side[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Lay dead beside him there[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
The words that her lover had said[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
Momma you know awaits the news[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
And she'll only know he's dead[/tab]

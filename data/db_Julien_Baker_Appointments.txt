[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]

[ch]C[/ch]

[tab]                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
I'm staying in tonight[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
I won't stop you from leaving[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]
I know that I'm not what you wanted, am I?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
   Wanted someone who I used to be like[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
Now you think I'm not trying[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]F[/ch]
Don't argue, it's not worth the effort to lie[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]Dm[/ch]
    You don't want to bring it up[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
And I already know how it looks.[/tab]

You don't have to remind me so much
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
How I disappoint you[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
   Suggest that I talk to somebody again[/tab]

That knows how to help me get better
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
And till then I should just try not to miss any[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
more appointments.[/tab]


[Interlude]
[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]

[ch]C[/ch]

[tab]                   [ch]Dm[/ch]
I think if I ruin this[/tab]

That I know I can live with it
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Nothing turns out like I pictured it.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
Maybe the emptiness is just a lesson in canvases[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Dm[/ch]
I think if I fail again that I know you're still listening[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Maybe it's all gonna turn out alright[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                                                  [ch]C[/ch]
And I know that it's not, but I have to believe that it is[/tab]

[tab]                          [ch]Dm[/ch]
I have to believe that it is[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
I have to believe that it is[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]F[/ch]
I have to believe that it is[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]Dm[/ch]
   And when I tell you that it is, oh, it's not for my benefit[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Maybe it's all gonna turn out alright[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
No, I know that it's not, but I have to believe that it is[/tab]

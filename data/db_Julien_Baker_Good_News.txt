[Verses]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]
Your long hair, a short walk[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
My biggest fear and a slow watch[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
The thin air, my ribs creak[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
Like wooden dining chairs when you see me[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Always scared[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
That every situation ends the same[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
With a blank stare, me and the tap water[/tab]
[tab][ch]Amaj7[/ch]
Circling the sink drain[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
Because it's heavy[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
But I'm trying really hard[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]
To keep my nose clean[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
The blue out of my arms[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C#m[/ch]
But it's not easy[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
It's not easy[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]Emaj7[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]
When what you think of me is important[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
And I know it shouldn't be so damn important[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
But it is to me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Amaj7[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]
And I'm only ever screaming at myself in public[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
I know I shouldn't act this way in public[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C#m[/ch]
I know I shouldn't make my friends all worry[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
When I go out at night[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]E[/ch]
And grind my teeth like sutures, my mouth like a wound[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
When I stay up and throw my voice about you[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]
Or less about you and more about[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Amaj7[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
How I ruin everything I think could be good news[/tab]

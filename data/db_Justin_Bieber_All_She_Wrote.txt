I came to the end of me, believin' the enemy[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Comin' with that "Mmm", man, you ain't a friend of me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
Nothing can fix that, ooh, not even the Hennessy[/tab]

[Verse 3]
N.C.
Thanks to all them Judas kisses, I got a masters in forgiveness
N.C.
I don't need a jail system, I walk in conviction
N.C.
I rather pray to God, than pray for wishes
N.C.
I'm supernatural, not superstitious, there's a difference
N.C.
Like relationship versus religion, that's a prison
N.C.
I'm lightin' circle, then royal purple inside a prism
N.C.
This flow is so universal, it came with dreams and visions
N.C.
I got the keys to the kingdom, I'm 'bout my father business
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
I came up straight from the bottom, I started from the finish[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
You can't undermine a mastermind[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
I may be out of your mind, but I ain't out of mine[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F#m[/ch]
I'm co-crucified, bury, resurrected[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
And perfected in the son of God[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
Just like water turn to wine, I'm a prophetic sign[/tab]
[tab]                                                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
Ask your barber, I'ma headliner in New York Times[/tab]
[tab]                                              [ch]F#m[/ch]
My life verses, I am His, yeah, and he is mine[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
The great "I Am's", the greatest Lamb of all time[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]F#m[/ch]
Rebranded, redesigned and redefined[/tab]

From Brandon to brand new
[tab]               [ch]Bm[/ch]
I'ma brand name in the household, brand too[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Who are you to tell me what I can't do? We need a [?], huh?[/tab]


[Outro]
N.C.
You ever ask yourself "Am I gonna make it?"
N.C.
Well, I don't know, of course I can fake it
N.C.
But honestly, can not go wrong
N.C.
I'm so tired, I'm so broken, I'm so weary
N.C.
Oh, God, oh, God

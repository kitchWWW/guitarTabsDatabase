[Verse 2]
His wife she rules the roost, the theater is obscene 
A spectacle for sport, a D list celebrity 
Their children miss behave, he stares through the tv set 
Wondering how many yesses yes him in this mess 
If he’d only just yessed less somehow 
 
[Chorus]
The Yes Man’s willing to carry the load 
Knows not how to say know to anyone 
Yes Man he’s just a bird in the flock, doesn’t know what he wants 
Say jump he’ll say how high 
The Yes Man he nods his head and smiles 
 
[Bridge]

Oh Yes man if you’re in there now’s the time you must act [/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]
Yes Man you can do it leave and never look back [/tab]
[tab][ch]C7[/ch] 
Yes Man we believe in you, you must follow through [/tab]
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]                             [ch]F7[/ch]                    [ch]G7[/ch] 
Yes Man You can be a No Man too [/tab]
 
[Chorus]
The Yes Man’s willing to carry the load 
Knows not how to say know to anyone 
Yes Man he’s just a bird in the flock, doesn’t know what he wants 
Say jump he’ll say how high

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Well I've been on the Grand Ole Opry[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Played a show with ZZ top[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Went on tour with Skinnered, man them boys still rock[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
Shot the bull with Bocephus, before he climbed up on his jet[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
Played South Florida for Alan Jackson, that's something's that you never forget[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
But all that stuff that make you feel real good[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
But not near as good [/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
As flying down a back road[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]
With some buddies from back home[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
Splash of Jack in my Coke[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
Catching brim on a Zebco[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
Spotting deer in a hay field[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
After church or Sunday meal[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Hugging my mama before I go[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Flying down a back road[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Well up there in Deimoine [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Remembered those songs line by line[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I just stood there in the fake smoke[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Another dream came true that night[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
I've been so many place my mom and daddy ain't never seen[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
All the way to California to as far as you can get away[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
But all that stuff that make you feel real good[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
But not near as good [/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
As flying down a back road[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
With some buddies from back home[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
Splash of Jim Beam in my Coke[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
Catching brim on a Zebco[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
Spotting deer in a hay field[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
After church or Sunday meal[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
Hugging my mama before I go[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Flying down a back road[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm a lucky man I got a real good life[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
But of all the things I've done nothing gets me as high[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
As flying down a back road[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
With some buddies from back home[/tab]

[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Catching brim on a Zebco[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
Kill a deer in a hay field[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
After church or Sunday meal[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

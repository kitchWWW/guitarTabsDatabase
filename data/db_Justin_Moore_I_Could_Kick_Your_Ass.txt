Genre: 
Key: 


You got your million bucks([ch]D[/ch])
You got your flashy sports car([ch]G[/ch])
You got your trophy girls([ch]A[/ch])
Man you think you're a star([ch]D[/ch])

You got your teeth bleached([ch]D[/ch])
You like to play the rich game([ch]G[/ch])
Yeah, you think you're a cowboy([ch]A[/ch])
The new Jesse James([ch]D[/ch])

But I could kick your ass([ch]D[/ch])
I could jack your jaw([ch]G[/ch])
Put you flat in the dirt, boy([ch]A[/ch])
Yeah, I'd have a ball([ch]D[/ch])
So go ahead and act tough([ch]D[/ch])
Like you're John Wayne's son([ch]G[/ch])
But things can change fast([ch]A[/ch])
I could kick your ass([ch]D[/ch])

Try to steal my girl([ch]D[/ch])
You'd better bring your big friend([ch]G[/ch])
Another one or two([ch]A[/ch])
Because you're gonna need them([ch]D[/ch])
You're a little too small([ch]D[/ch])
To be callin' me names([ch]G[/ch])
I'm 'bout to knock that smirky grin([ch]A[/ch])
Right off your face([ch]D[/ch])

But I could kick your ass([ch]D[/ch])
I could jack your jaw([ch]G[/ch])
Put you flat in the dirt, boy([ch]A[/ch])
Yeah, I'd have a ball([ch]D[/ch])
So go ahead and act tough([ch]D[/ch])
Like you're John Wayne's son([ch]G[/ch])
But things can change fast([ch]A[/ch])
I could kick your ass([ch]D[/ch])

Yeah, I could kick your ass([ch]D[/ch])
I could jack your jaw([ch]G[/ch])
Put you flat in the dirt, boy([ch]A[/ch])
Hell, I'd have a ball([ch]D[/ch])
So go ahead and act tough([ch]D[/ch])
Like you're John Wayne's son([ch]G[/ch])
But things can change fast([ch]A[/ch])
I could kick your ass([ch]D[/ch])

Key: 


Submitted by Caitie Woods. I love this song but since I couldn't find the
 tabs or chords to this I sat there and listened to it and put it together.
 Hope yall like it. No capo and standard tuning. And for the ones that aint
 actual notes but sound good together or are actually tabs i just called them
 riffs and I'll put above where it starts the number that the riffs are. Like
 example 1 or 2.

No copy right. I spent my time learning this all by ear. My rights to the chord and tabs 
on this.

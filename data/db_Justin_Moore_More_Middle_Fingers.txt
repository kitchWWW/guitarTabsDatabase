[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
This one's for the IRS, in bed with the damn politicians[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
And this one's for the boss, the hoss, who wouldn't let you off to go fishin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And to the bulls and the bears on Wall Street, takin' you and me to the cleaner's[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Man it's stuff like that that makes me wish I had more middle fingers[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Let 'em fly in the sky, get 'em all up high in the air[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Let 'em flip like you don't give a rip, like your mama ain't there[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                              [ch]F[/ch]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Hey, gimme one for the haters of The Son, yeah, the one in the hippie sandals[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Yeah, and how 'bout one for the lack of respect for Mr. Jack and Charlie Daniels[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
If you don't like the troops and the red, white, and blue collar cold beer drinkers[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]A#[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]

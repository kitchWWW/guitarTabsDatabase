I copied most of this from Version 1 by stugreenham – Ver1 is really a great tab 
and helped me trememdously. I am updating this to include the change of name on 
chords C1/C2/C3 to F1/F2/F3, but as I mention above they are really just open F/F#/
G chords. I’m leaving them as F1/F2/F3 as it reinforces that the grip/position is 
the same, just sliding up/down the neck. Also some of the chord placements were a 
little off, so I made those adjustments and in the Bridge I believe it’s a quick 
(denoted by the parenthesis) Em not Dm chord on the first two lines. Other 
comments have said they just strum all strings open, except muting the Low E so 
you might try that as well. I also mute the low E string but leave the high E 
ringing open most of the time while sliding up on the F1/F2/F3, but not always - 
depends on how clean you want it to sound.  I hope this is helpful to other people 
and want to say thank you again to stugreenham for the first submission. It’s 
really well done and how I learned to play this song. Cheers!

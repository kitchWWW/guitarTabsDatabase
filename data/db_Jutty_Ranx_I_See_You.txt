You were never young, my love
I can tell, not by the way that you smell
But by the way you move your tongue, my love
Somebody shake me
What can I do?
Am I in love with The Night? Am I in love with you?
Will you take what I've got?
Will we die on the spot?
Too soon to say
What's your name, anyway?
 
You make me make moves
I see you, you know I see you
I break through to get to you
It's so true, it's so true
I see you, you know that I see you
And you know that it don't cost a thing
For us to see this through
 
When you came into focus
How could I pretend I didn't notice?
An incision when you looked back
You gave me tunnel vision right through the pack
Will you take what I've got?
Will we die on the spot?
Too soon to say
What's your name, anyway?
 
You make me make moves
I see you, you know I see you
I break through to get to you
It's so true, it's so true
I see you, you know that I see you
And you know that it don't cost a thing
For us to see this through
 
I crossed the party line
And lost it just to find it
All the people fall upon the beat and get behind it
I want you to myself
Can we take this somewhere else?
My heart's an open book and you just took it off the shelf
 
You make me make moves
I see you, you know I see you
I break through to get to you
It's so true, it's so true
I see you, you know that I see you
And you know that it don't cost a thing
For us to see this through

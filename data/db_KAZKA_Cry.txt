[Verse]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
What do you see? If I escape will I be saved?[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]
Can't estimate when you'll fade tell me I can't wait[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm learning fast I can't turn back[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
I died a million times when you left, when you said goodbye[/tab]

[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]
What do you see? Can you speak will I be saved?[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]
My hearts on ice can't think twice tell me, why, oh, why?[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm falling fast stuck in the past[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
I try and understand it hurts so bad how long will it last?[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I'm flying through the storms[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
The answer is in the sky[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]
That 'everything I am is because of you' (oh)[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
But I know I won't die[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
I'll live without your love[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
I take back every word, every woman’s tears[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]
What do you feel? Say it loud, speak into my soul[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]
'A winters day never fades' that's what I was told[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]
I lost myself without your help[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
I fell straight back to hell or is it heaven? Maybe, I don't know?[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I'm flying through the storms[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
The answer is in the sky[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]
That 'everything I am is because of you' (oh)[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
But I know I won't die[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
I'll live without your love[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
I take back every word, every woman’s tears (x2)[/tab]

[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I'm flying through the storms[/tab]

[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
Long distance in the way of what could be,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]
even when your here you're not with me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                                 [ch]Ab[/ch]
She's having the child I should've carried[/tab]

I'll be dammed if you get married
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
House up there be how you adjust it [/tab]
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]
Ain't gon' work you got problems trusting[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                                 [ch]Ab[/ch]
Let me stop I'm supposed to be focused [/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Bbm[/ch]
But these nights are the coldest[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                     [ch]Cm[/ch]           [ch]Db[/ch]
Will you ever let it go? I don't know [/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Bbm[/ch]
Will I ever be first? I hope.[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Cm[/ch]      [ch]Db[/ch]
But I ain't just sitting around [/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]Bbm[/ch]
Can't wait for someone who's singing my words.[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Cm[/ch]  [ch]Db[/ch]
Damn I can't compete with a baby [/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Gb[/ch]
Is there any room left in your heart for me?[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]Db[/ch]                                       [ch]Bbm[/ch]
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Fm[/ch]                   [ch]Ab[/ch]
Maybe I should call, maybe I should call.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Db[/ch]                                       [ch]Bbm[/ch]
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Fm[/ch]                    [ch]Ab[/ch]
But I'll never call, maybe that's my flaw.[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]
Maybe that's why I ain't got a man [/tab]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
Cause I be too in too much thinking[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]                          [ch]Gb[/ch]
Tryna compensate for your absence [/tab]

But no drug can't take where you
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
Try to know try just want you where I am [/tab]
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]
1000 of them, just one him[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
Drowning in along my excuses [/tab]
N.C.
Hardest and him useless, 
[tab]                           [ch]Bbm[/ch]
probably should use it less[/tab]

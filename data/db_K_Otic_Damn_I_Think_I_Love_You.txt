[Em] for 20 days I've been lost in cyberspace
I surf thru the web
To catch up with you trace
And I [C] wonder- who you really [G] are [D]
[Em] I only caught a hasty screenshot
Of you smile
You told me al your hotspots
You really make me [C] wonder
Do you now who I [G] am [D]

[C] Breath me- [G] it's so exciting
I [B7] only wanna know if you're for [C] real

Damn I think I [Em] love you
I think I really [G] love you
Cause I [D] believe you're the one
Who can make it al come [C] true
I think I really [Em] love you
Baby I [G] need you
Yeeeh
[D] Let's set up a blind date tonight
[C] yeah yeah yeah yeeehh
Or I'll just say [Em] goodbye

[Em] it's easy to confess to anonymous victims
But the since I got to know you
Boy we're getting [C] deeper-
are we going too [G] far [D]
[Em] we talk about the weirdest thoughts
We've got in mind
And share the same desire
It's crazy how I [C] found you
Do you now what I [G] mean [D]
Yeah

[C] Love me- [G] enter my world
I [B7] only wanna hold you in my [C] arms
 Damn I think I [Em] love you
I think I really [G] love you
If you [D] mean what you say
you don't say what you mean ain't [C] true
I think I really [Em] love you
Baby I [G] need you
Yeeeh
[D] Let's set up a blind date tonight
[C] yeah yeah yeah yeeehh
Or I'll just say [Em] goodbye

[[ch]C[/ch]] Gently
[tab][[ch]G[/ch]] Drifting
[B7] Along with the endless [C] tide[/tab]
[[ch]C[/ch]] Craving
[tab][[ch]G[/ch]] Crossing
[B7] The boundaries where we'll [Em][/tab]

Baby I [G] need you

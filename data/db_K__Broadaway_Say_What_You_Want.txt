[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch] 
Say what you want, I've heard it all before [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch] 
With your words of leaving, and your bags packed at the door [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch] 
I could beg you to stay, but I don't know what for [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch] 
Maybe it's time you took your bags and walked on out the door. [/tab]
  
[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch] 
My heart can't take the games you play, inside my mind [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch] 
You've told me about your leaving, one too many times [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]      
And yeah I see you standing there with your tear filled eyes [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch] 
I'll ask you this tonight, if you leave, "Stay gone this time"[/tab]
  
[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch] 
We sure had some good times, maybe we should let them be [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch] 
'Cause now your words of anger, are all pointed straight at me [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch] 
There's no sense in fighting, what will be will be [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch] 
Maybe we should close that door and just set each other free [/tab]
  
[Chorus] 
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch] 
My heart can't take the games you play, inside my mind [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch] 
You've told me about your leaving, one too many times [/tab]

And yeah I see you standing there with your tear filled eyes [/tab]

All those times before, I've never felt like this [/tab]

As you lean in slowly, to give me one last kiss [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
She shot me, she shot me,[/tab]
Bang, bang… she shot me. (x3)

[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
She shot me, she shot me,[/tab]
Bang, bang. (Get out the way, yo)

[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
Ahh… there she goes again,[/tab]
The dopest Ethiopian.
In other words, she came through explodin’
In the podium, dynamite
Napoleon like sodium mixed with petroleum,
Slowly but surely, she was walking toward me
Cut the convo short ‘cause she had to wake up early,
But continuing the story,
Don’t worry she gave me digits for her Blackberry
“You’re very handsome” is what she said.
And the way she looked in my eyes said “Put me to bed.”

[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
Oh my, oh my, I should have known when she said to me on the phone:[/tab]
“You do not know me very well, but I would never hurt a fly.”
Then she aimed at my chest with love in her eye.
I said she aimed at my chest with love in her eye.

(Chorus)
[tab]                [ch]B[/ch]
She was walkin’ around with a loaded shotgun[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A#[/ch]
Ready to fire me a hot one.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D#m[/ch]
It went bang, bang, bang…[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G#[/ch]
Straight through my heart. (Straight through my heart)[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]
Although I could have walked away,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A#[/ch]
I stood my ground and let her spray.[/tab]

[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
She shot me, she shot me[/tab]
Bang ,bang… she shot me (x3)
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang.

[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
Scorpion,[/tab]
She’s so hot she’s a scorch-ian,
Killing me softly,
Lauryn or Kevorkian,
Couldn’t tell if she’s coo-coo or corky, when
I asked her her name she said “Call me Ten.”
Testing, testing
Things just got more interesting
She’s dressed in a vest pin, double-breasted holster,
A very Western toaster,
She ain’t nothing Kosher.
Ah… she lets me closer.
Hotter than a pepper-crusted Samosa
While I try to keep my composure.

(Chorus)
[tab]                [ch]B[/ch]
She was walkin’ around with a loaded shotgun[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A#[/ch]
Ready to fire me a hot one.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D#m[/ch]
It went bang, bang, bang…[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G#[/ch]
Straight through my heart. (Straight through my heart)[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]
Although I could have walked away,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A#[/ch]
I stood my ground and let her spray.[/tab]


[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
Am I wrong?[/tab]
But what is love without the pain to go along?
And what is pain if not the reason for me to sing this song?
And this song is for the weak and for the strong.
Cause I was strong and still…
She got me, she got me,
Bang, bang… she got me.
She got me, she got me,
Bang, bang.

(Chorus)

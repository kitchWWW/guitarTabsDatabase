(chord pattern  E  F#  A  E  repeats during verses)
 If you can take a rain check on a stormy night
 Then I will love you 'til you're old, like you're Betty White
 You can hurt me any other day, pick a fight
 But not on Monday, Tuesday, wednesday, Thursday, Friday night
 And not the weekend either, cuz I got a song to write
 I promise I'mma hear you out when the time is right
 Let's have a talk, August 7, 20-99
 At your place or mine?

{chorus}

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]F#[/ch]
Hey why you turn around and walk away[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]          
I know you got a lot to say[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
And I really want to talk about it,  Just not today, not today.[/tab]

Is there an instrument to measure all the heartache, and
A looking glass so we can see where all the magic went
I need a button I can push so we can start again
Cause girl you bring me to my knees, Nancy Kerrigan......

{chorus}
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
You can hurt me, You can hurt me, You can hurt me, [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#[/ch]
You can hurt me, You can hurt me, You can hurt me, You can hurt me, [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
You can hurt me tomorrow, You can hurt me tomorrow, [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                                                
You can hurt me tomorrow but girl save it for tomorrow.  [/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I don't wanna be left[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
In this war tonight[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Am I alone in this fight?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Is anybody out there?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
Don't wanna be left left in this world behind[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Say you'll run to my side[/tab]

[K'naan]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Something 'bout mary[/tab]

Never won a pageant
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Never felt pretty[/tab]

Never looked like cameron
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Diaz was her last name[/tab]

Always been abandoned
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Keep your head up[/tab]

Baby girl this is your anthem
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
There goes hannah[/tab]

Showin' off her banner
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Rocking that crown[/tab]

Make them boys go bananas
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
When you're insecure about yourself[/tab]

It's a fact
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You can point a finger[/tab]

But there's three pointing back

[Pre-chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I can see her crying out, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Is there anybody out there?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
She's really counting on your love[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Still struggling uphill[/tab]

But you act like you don't care
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Right now she could really use a shoulder[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Hanging onto the edge til it's over[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
She's crying for your love tonight[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Loneliest heart to survive, she said[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I don't wanna be left[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
In this war tonight[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Am I alone in this fight?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Is anybody out there?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
Don't wanna be left left in this world behind[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Say you'll run to my side[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
Is anybody out there? yeah, yeah, yeah[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]           
Is anybody out there?[/tab]


[K'naan]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
His name was adam[/tab]

When his mom had him
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Dad was a phantom never took a look at him[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Grew up mad and antisocial[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Hated outdoors, always in playing madden[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Adam was lonely[/tab]

Drugs were the only
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Way out of his own life[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
Now he's slowly losing his fire[/tab]

Close to retire
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
With one last hope he puts his arms up higher[/tab]

[Pre-chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I can see him crying out, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Is there anybody out there?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
he's really counting on your love[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Still struggling uphill[/tab]

But you act like you don't care
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Right now he could really use a shoulder[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Hanging onto the edge til it's over[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
he's crying for your love tonight[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Loneliest heart to survive, he said[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I don't wanna be left[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
In this war tonight[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Am I alone in this fight?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Is anybody out there?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
Don't wanna be left left in this world behind[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Say you'll run to my side[/tab]
                                  
Is anybody out there? 
                          

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
If you feel the way I feel[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Like you've been talking to yourself[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]G[/ch]
Well this one's for everyone who's felt invisible[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
Lonely in a crowded room[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Searching for someone like you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
Can't do it all alone (no one can baby)[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Can't do it all alone (no one should baby)[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch] 
Is anybody out there?[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Is anybody out there?[/tab]

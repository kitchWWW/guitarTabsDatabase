[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]

[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
And open doors to hurting people like me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
People like me, People like me[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Is it fair to say that I am stressing out[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm stationed in Iraq and they won't let me out[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
My homies said I was stupid for even joining[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
My counselor said that my decision was disappointing[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
How she had good slate for good state colleges[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And with my good grades it wouldn't have been a problem[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
But they don't understand just the power of significance[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
More than brilliance and certainly more than dividends[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
And if you ask me now would I repeat it[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Would I fight in a war I don't believe in[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Well the answer is it's not me where the cancer is[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
They been doing this before Jesus of Nazereth[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And after all this time it is still deadly hazardous[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
And Bush isn't really being all that inaccurate[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
When he says we're winning the war cos its staggering[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But thats cos we're killing everybody that we see[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
And most of us soldiers we can barely fall asleep[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
And time and time again I'm feeling incompetent[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
Cos my woman back home, we're constantly arguing[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I must be crazy cos all I'm obsessing with is[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
Her myspace and facebook and who's commenting[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]
I swear to god if she's cheatin' I'm doin her ass in[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
I can tell with one look[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
And it came to me sounding something like a song hook[/tab]


[Hook]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
And open doors to hurting people like me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
People like me, People like me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
People like me, People like me[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]
Meet Sarah, the proud mother of young Sebastian[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Suburban professional went to college in Ashton[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
In self pity she suddenly cried[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Would my life be important if I suddenly died?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]
Neighbors saying what a nice women she was[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
Keeping mostly to herself ever since the divorce[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
And with the company downsizing and the fall and all[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
She really shouldn't take it that personal at all[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
It wasn't her boss who had his eyes on her thighs[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
And got a rise from her rising off the desk though[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And despite remembering saying no plenty of times[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
It was still a damn surprise being let go[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
And now stuck with a mortgage she can't afford[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
And too educated to blame the corporate world[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
She got on welfare and hated it case work a power trippin[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And generally being degraded if[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
Nothing else she was treated sick[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]
And ineffective which is the worst thing[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
That she'd been left with[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Damn, no magic from David Blaine[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
No painter to paint this pain[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
No Morgan Freeman to narrate the shame[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
So she took refuge in prayer[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Kinda like finding god in the phone book[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
And it came to her sounding something like a song hook[/tab]


[Hook]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
And open doors to hurting people like me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
People like me, People like me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
People like me, People like me[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]
I guess I told you about myself to a degree[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Just by telling you about people like me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
But people like me they speak politely[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
They don't start no beef for a piece of white meat[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]
Everybody gotta eat but everybody doesn't[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
Which is why I want to tell you about my favorite cousin[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
He and I grew up where the sun shines[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
And we both partook in the gun crimes[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
And we both liked American rap rhymes[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
Even though we didn't understand one line[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
If you remember my liner notes in my last album[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
I talked about a close call with a grenade[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]
I think we both must have been about 7th grade[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
But don't panic we both survived without damage[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
But we developed a bond like we survived the titanic[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
So when the country became frantic[/tab]

My mother tried to get us out, planned it
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
To the last detail except the plan got derailed[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]D[/ch]
Cos there wasn't enough money for the plane tickets[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
How bitter when my mother had to choose who to take with her[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                                                 [ch]Em[/ch]
So my cousin got left in the war and that's just hard to recall[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
But now I take refuge in prayer[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Kinda like finding god in the phone book[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
It came to me sounding kinda like something from a song hook[/tab]


[Hook]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
And open doors to hurting people like me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
People like me, People like me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
People like me, People like me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
And open doors to hurting people like me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
People like me, People like me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
People like me, People like me[/tab]

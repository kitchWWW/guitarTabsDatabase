Artist: K'naan
Song: Sleep When We Die
Genre: 
Key: Ab


        Capo on 1, key of Ab makes you play a G.

The verses/bridges stay on a G really and adding a C/G fast changing sounds about right.
[Verse 1]
             G                       C/G
We kicking down the door if ever they don't let us in
              G                        C/G
We don't give a fuck, guess we on that medicine
               G                            C/G
I'm on that Marley Kush and I ain't talking cannabis
                G                               C/G
I'm on that crazy bush, yea, something like the president


[Bridge 1]
         G                    C/G
Where am I? Where am I? Don't have a clue
           G                   C/G
I'm tripping on stumbling all over you
            G                           C/G
Sorry just sick a belt, I wasn't tryin' to Copperfield
               G                           C/G
Somebody take the wheel, I'm not drunk I'm on the thrill

[Verse 2]
      G              C/G
Found me with the crew
      G              C/G
Those minutes in the outlaws
         G              C/G
We used to breaking rules
           G              C/G
And runnin' from them cop cars
              G              C/G
You know them boys in blue, they could be such a kill joy
                G              C/G
You see us on the news but we just tryin' to chill boy


[Bridge 2]
                  G              C/G
Where am I? Where am I? Don't have a clue
                G              C/G
I'm tripping on stumbling all over you
                 G              C/G
Sorry but girl you're bad, OK I'm in the touch out
                  G              C/G
Somebody take the wheel, I'm not drunk I'm on the thrill

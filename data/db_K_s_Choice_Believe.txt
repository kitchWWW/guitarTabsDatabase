Bravely I look further than I see[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
Knowing things I know I cannot be, not now[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]*                              [ch]Am/E[/ch]
I'm so aware of where I am,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
but I don't know where that is, and there's something right in front of me and I[/tab]

Touch the fingers of my hand, and I wonder if it's me[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Holding on and on to theories of prosperity, someone who can promise me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]Bb[/ch]
                I believe in me[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]*                              [ch]Am/E[/ch]
Tomorrow I was nothing, yesterday I'll be[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
Time has fooled me into thinking it's a part of me[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]*                              [ch]Am/E[/ch]
Nothing in this room but empty space[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
No me, no world, no mind, no face[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Bb[/ch]
Touch the fingers of my hand and tell me if it's me[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]
Holding on and on to love, what else is real, a religion that appeals to me, oh[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
I believe in me[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]        [ch]Bb[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]
Can you turn me off for just a second, please[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Gm[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
Turn me into something faceless, weightless, mindless, homeless, vacuum state of peace[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                                       [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on, I believe in me (Play twice)[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                       [ch]C[/ch]
Wait for me, I'm nothing on my own[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                      [ch]Bb[/ch]
I'm willing to go on, but not alone, not now[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
I'm so aware of everything, but nothing seems for real and[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
As long as you're in front of me then I'll[/tab]

I Watch the fingers of our hands, and I'm grateful that it's me[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]

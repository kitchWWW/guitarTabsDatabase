[tab]	[ch]D[/ch]
You think you havent changed[/tab]
[tab]		[ch]D[/ch]
You think I am being sentimental[/tab]
[tab]		[ch]G[/ch]
You finally reached that age[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]Bm[/ch]		[ch]A[/ch]
Security is fundamental[/tab]

[tab]		[ch]D[/ch]
You think you havent changed[/tab]
[tab]		[ch]D[/ch]
You think that you are just growing older[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]G[/ch]
You wanted to be safe [/tab]
[tab]		[ch]Bm[/ch]		 [ch]A[/ch]
But it turned you into someone colder[/tab]

[tab]		[ch]D[/ch]	
You are so busy these days[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]Bm[/ch]
Rearranging your place[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]G[/ch]		[ch]Em[/ch]		[ch]A[/ch]
Can you still find some space for yourself[/tab]

Is anyone to blame[/tab]
	
I really like to think its you
[tab]	[ch]G[/ch]
But it seems like thats the way[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]B[/ch]		[ch]A[/ch]
Every wonder in me is gone[/tab]

[tab]	[ch]D[/ch]
You are so busy these days[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]Bm[/ch]
Rearranging your face[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]G[/ch]		[ch]Em[/ch]	  [ch]A[/ch]
Do you still see a trace of yourself[/tab]

[tab]	[ch]D[/ch]
I am losing all of you[/tab]

To future plans and obligations
[tab]	     [ch]G[/ch]
I guess that's what you do [/tab]
[tab]		 [ch]Bm[/ch]
When life is about your next vacation[/tab]

[tab]	  [ch]D[/ch]
You are so busy these days[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]Bm[/ch]
Rearranging your place[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]G[/ch]		[ch]Em[/ch]		[ch]A[/ch]	
Can you still find some space for yourself[/tab]

You are so busy these days
Rearranging your face
Do you still see a trace of yourself

You think you haven't changed
You think you havent changed
You think you havent changed

She wants her faith now
They took her away
Stares at the cross above
Her mother's grave
Well I can't even feel my arms
Holding me
I can't even see my eyes closing

Em Cadd7


Sits on the corner
Takes off his dress
Jill's in the backseat
Who's this girl I'm with
Well, I can't even see my
Hands in front of me
I can't even hear my voice
My voice

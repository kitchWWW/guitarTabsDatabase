[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch] 
[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch] 


[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Dm[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]Dm[/ch] 
  We went to the youth club and we   looked out of place.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Dm[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]Dm[/ch]
  I didn't know where to look, So I   looked at your face.[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Dm[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]Dm[/ch] 
 But you were a boxing champ, and   I was a weakling.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]Dm[/ch]   
  You didn't give me a chance,   You gave me a beating.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I thank you very much that you did.[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Dm[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]Dm[/ch] 
  And as the time went by, we   stayed out of trouble,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]Dm[/ch] 
  Before I could realise   my age had doubled.[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch] 
The man I became is a tragic bore,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
And he's not a boxing champ anymore.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch] 
If there's one thing I've learnt it's to run away,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
At least I enjoy what I do today.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I thank you very much that I do.[/tab]


[Outro]
[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch] 
[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch] 
[ch]C[/ch]

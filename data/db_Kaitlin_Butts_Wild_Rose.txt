[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                        
When she was young they called her Wild Rose[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
The ladies in the town turned up their nose.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                      
The boys all loved her heaven knows[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
She would never be tied down.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]            
She said that she was getting out, the first chance she had she'd take it.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]      
Don't know when, don't know how, but I know for sure that I'll make it.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                      [ch]F[/ch]
So on the day that she, she turned 18, she bought her ticket for the GreyHound bus.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                            [ch]G[/ch]
He looked up from his cowboy hat and said, "Oh baby, what about us?".[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]       
She said, "I've got to go, I've got to bloom [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                                      [ch]C[/ch]                         
but in this small town, babe, there ain't no room for this Wild Rose".[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]C[/ch]
And he looked at her and said, "Well, baby, you can bloom no matter where you are, [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                                                                               
you don't have to live in the sky to be a star, you don't have to be a sun to shine.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch] (hold)          [ch]C[/ch]
Baby, just be mine." [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                [ch]F[/ch]
She got on the bus, said, "I just can't stay" / She didn't look back as they pulled away, [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]
but the hummin? of the tires couldn't drown out the words she heard him say.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                                 [ch]F[/ch]     
There beside the road, she saw a wild rose and it bloomed right there where God had planted it [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch] (hold)    
on an old, rusty barbed wire fence and all of a sudden it all made sense when he said, [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                              [ch]Am[/ch]
"Baby, you can bloom no matter where you are, you don't have to live in the sky to be a star, you [/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]G[/ch] (hold)         [ch]C[/ch]
don't have to be a sun to shine. Baby, just be mine."...[/tab]

Am (hold)
Well the bus pulled away with an empty seat.
           F (hold)
She made a call sayin, "Baby, come and get me." 
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                         [ch]G[/ch]      
They drove all through the night and went home to see an Oklahoma sun rise.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]      
Sittin on the porch late at night watchin? their babies chasin? fireflies.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                [ch]G[/ch] (slow)
The little one looks up at the sky and says, "I wanna be a star".[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
And they said, "Baby, you can bloom no matter where you are, [/tab]
                   G                       C (strum once)
you don't have to live in the sky to be a star."

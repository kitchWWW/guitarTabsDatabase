You’re sitting on Sunday[/tab]
No one knows you
To them you seem like a devil
Oh what if on this day
you ended up your life
What d’u leave to humanity ?

Is anybody walking in this way ?[/tab]
Is it real or just a dream ?

Let’s look out of the window ?[/tab]
Let’s look out of the window ?

[tab]Chorus : [ch]Em[/ch] / [ch]C/G[/ch] / [ch]G[/ch] / [ch]B7[/ch]
One peace to live in this world today[/tab]
No, faith, that’s why I don’t pray
So pleace, please
One Peace To live in this world today
In this world today
(Let ring)

Verse 2
No one knows your pain
Denying main troubles
Are we here to talk about it ?
No no no more affection
They need more attention
Would you like a cup of tea ?

One peace to live in this world
No no no
No faith and I don’t pray today

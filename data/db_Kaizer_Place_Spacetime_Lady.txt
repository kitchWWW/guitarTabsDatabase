Intro : [ch]A[/ch] / [ch]D[/ch] / [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]Verse 1 : [ch]A[/ch] / [ch]D[/ch] / [ch]C[/ch]
Somebody paid you your last drink[/tab]
Was it for friendship
Or for desire ? desire
Your reputation on the floor
is not to be anymore
But you don’t care
You don’t care

[tab]Chorus : [ch]A[/ch] / [ch]G[/ch] / [ch]D[/ch]
Spacetime Lady (ouh ouh)[/tab]
You’re not my baby (ouh ouh)
You’re on fire (ouh ouh)
Ready for pleasure (ouh ouh)

Intro
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Now, now, now[/tab]

Verse 2 
Your biggest fantasy is to moan
You have to grow up and not become a number
Only a number
Your sins will never be expiated
whatever priest in front of you
There’s no regret in your look
No brightness in your mind

Chorus

[tab]Bridge : [ch]A[/ch]
I hope one day you’ll realized[/tab]
Glam and lust can’t be your ways
So you’ll find yourself
Alone (alone) Alone (alone) Alone

Chorus
(Now, now , now)

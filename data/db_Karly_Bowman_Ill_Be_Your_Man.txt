[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G5[/ch]
Read your mind, we’re not a threat[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G5[/ch]
I heard you when you said you loved me, inside your head[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G5[/ch]
I’d say it back, if it wasn’t all pretend[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G5[/ch]
But I know by tomorrow he’ll be lying in you bed[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]E5[/ch]
Couldn’t sleep, you’re haunting my dream[/tab]
[tab][ch]G5[/ch]
We both know he can’t be everything you want and need[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G5[/ch]
I’ll be your man if you ask me too[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G5[/ch]
What can he give that I can’t give you[/tab]
[tab][ch]E5[/ch]
Say i’m your soulmate, but he’s who you choose[/tab]
[tab][ch]G5[/ch]
Are you lying to me, are you lying to you[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G5[/ch]
You have to go, and see it through[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G5[/ch]
You whisper don’t worry one day i’ll fight for you[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G5[/ch]
There’s your bullshit, it’s peaking through[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G5[/ch]
Too bad we both know i’d still come back to you[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]E5[/ch]
Couldn’t sleep, you’re haunting my dreams[/tab]
[tab][ch]G5[/ch]
We Both Know he can’t be everything you want and need[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G5[/ch]
I'll be your man if you ask me to[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G5[/ch]
What can he give that I can't give you?[/tab]
[tab][ch]E5[/ch]
Say I'm your soulmate, but he's who you choose[/tab]
[tab][ch]G5[/ch]
Are you lying to me?[/tab]

Are you lying?
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G5[/ch]
I'll be your man if you ask me to[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G5[/ch]
What can he give that I can't give you[/tab]
[tab][ch]E5[/ch]
Say I'm your soulmate, but he's who you choose[/tab]
[tab][ch]E5[/ch]
Are you lying to me?[/tab]

Are you lying to you?

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G5[/ch]
And all your sorrys and apologies are out of tune[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G5[/ch]
You moved on, but I'm still stuck with you in every room[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G5[/ch]
I was the best thing that you never even got to lose[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]G5[/ch]
And all the ways I said you'd leave are finally coming true[/tab]

[tab][ch]E5[/ch]
I'll still keep ignoring all the signs[/tab]

If you'd let me

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G5[/ch]
I'll be your man if you ask me to[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G5[/ch]
What can he give that I can't give you?[/tab]
[tab][ch]E5[/ch]
Say I'm your soulmate, but he's who you choose[/tab]
[tab][ch]G5[/ch]
Are you lying to me?[/tab]

Are you lying to you?

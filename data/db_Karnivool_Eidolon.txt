[Intro]
[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] x2


[Verse 1]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
I couldn't hide my face to claim my innocence[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                      [ch]Bm[/ch]
I wouldn't have the sense to keep going on[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
Maybe I'm just too proud to stand in your defense?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]Bm[/ch]
Still I feel the pull of hidden wires[/tab]


[Chorus 1]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm never gonna try[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Bm[/ch]
I lied, I dared to speak my mind[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Em[/ch]
When all the old changes made before[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
Don't seem to change a thing at all[/tab]


[Post-Chorus 1]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]Bm[/ch]
Are you real?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]Bm[/ch]
Are you real?[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                    [ch]Bm[/ch]
I wouldn't find my place with this poor disguise[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                                    [ch]Bm[/ch]
Why can't I face myself without these lies?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]Bm[/ch]
I couldn't find my path without knowing it[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
I've been around every turn, I know what's left is right[/tab]


[Chorus 2]
[tab]  *B [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
I never let it die[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Bm[/ch]
I tried, I dared to free my mind[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
And all the same changes as before[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
Don't seem to change a thing at all[/tab]


[Post-Chorus 2]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
I'm never gonna try, I know that I won't go back[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
It started with a smile, I know, but it won't come back[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]   [ch]Bm[/ch]
This is real[/tab]

[ch]Cmaj7[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch]


[Bridge 1]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
I should have seen it coming[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
Now I'm feeling nothing[/tab]

I was taken far beneath the middle
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
I should have seen it coming[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
Now I'm feeling nothing[/tab]

I was taken far beneath the middle


[Outro]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
I'm never gonna try, I know that I won't go back[/tab]

(I should have seen it coming, now I'm feeling nothing, I was taken far beneath the middle)
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]Bm[/ch]

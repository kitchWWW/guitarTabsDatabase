[tab][ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]Gm[/ch]
Don't hang on[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]F#m[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
just because you can[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Gm[/ch] 
now you must let go[/tab]

VERSE 3
As you fall astern
and we all prepare to yearn
for the one who once was

I'll think of the good
and work on the things we should -
put an end to

up somewhere[/tab]

no place near[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Hm[/ch]
far from here[/tab]

I know that you are[/tab]

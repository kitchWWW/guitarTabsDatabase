[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                         [ch]F[/ch]
I can't go to sleep tonight, because the thought of darkness makes me feel alive[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                       [ch]F[/ch]
I can't find a way to dream, when I'm thinking about every single thing[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
I think I'll be happier if I turn my brain off 'til the morning stirs[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]F[/ch]
I think I will find a day, when all this noise will help me sink away[/tab]

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Dm[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
My mind is running away with my sleep tonight[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Dm[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch] 
My mind is running away with my sleep tonight[/tab]

[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]
Let's get out of our minds. And take a little time to[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]
Look at the stars and the moon above. Wishing someone like you[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Fm[/ch]
Was staring at them too[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]F[/ch]
I can see my shadowed mirrors, reflecting all my deepest darkest fears[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]
I think home will fix this mess. A bed of my own makes it worth the stress[/tab]

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Dm[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
My mind is running away with my sleep tonight[/tab]

My mind is running away with my sleep tonight[/tab]

It's a long shot to not think that we're alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
But it's not far off to know someone else is here and there and home[/tab]

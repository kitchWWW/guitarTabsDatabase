The rain poured down from the grey sky above
Hey ho, the rain pissed down
But the devil he went hasty
And steady running fast
Hey ho, oh this could never last
And then he saw my home through
The branches and the leaves
Hey ho, lay hidden by the trees
Inside my darling loved one
And children oh so sweet
Hey ho, my children oh so sweet

Lord knows you're only human
You were tired and you wanted to go home
Pay me the soul of your one true love
Or you will never see your children again

Oh Lord knows you're only human
You were tired and you wanted to go home
Pay me the soul of your one true love
Or you will never see your children again
Save my soul!

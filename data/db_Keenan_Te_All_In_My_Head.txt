[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I don't blame you for leaving[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
But how did you make it look easy?[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Was I just for a season?[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Just something to help pass the time[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
I'm still searching for the reason[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
You changed your mind and left without warning[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
I don't blame you if you needed space[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
But why'd you have to leave me behind?[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
I know good things end[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
But I didn't think that we were hanging on by a thread[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
Now I'm stuck making amends[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
For someone who couldn't care less[/tab]


[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
Why'd you give up and leave me for dead?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
I guess your love was all in my head[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm7[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
Why'd you run away, run away, run away just so fast?[/tab]

Guess you didn't love me like that


[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Oh I tried to forget you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
But I see you in every face[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Do you still think of me?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm7[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
Or am I driving down a one way street?[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Em7[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
I know good things end[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
But I didn't think that we were hanging on by a thread[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
Now I'm stuck making amends[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
For someone who couldn't care less[/tab]


[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
Why'd you give up and leave me for dead?[/tab]

I guess your love was all in my head
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Why'd you run away, run away, run away just so fast?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
Oh woah was I too much or just not enough?[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Was I moving too fast and you couldn't keep up?[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm7[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah I would've stayed through all the pain, every mistake, the good and the bad[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
But I guess you didn't love me like that[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
Oh[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
Yeah I guess you didn't love me like that[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Oh[/tab]

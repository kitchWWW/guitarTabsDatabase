[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Come on Mary, Mary or you, John,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
To which religion do you belong?[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
You and your lover, you and your friend,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
Peace in the end.[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
What about me, me and my kind,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
If we're unknown, are we left behind?[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
We have our lovers, too, and our friend,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Hope in the end.[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]

[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
You may think our lives are forever.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
I think you could be wrong.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
But if we were to gather together,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
I know we could get on.[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
I've seen them stand at the top of the hill,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
And none of them coming down,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
But who will be the last one to kill?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
And who will be the clown?[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
Go ask your neighbours to come and sing songs,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
You know they've wanted to all along.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
I've seen them smile for their friends,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
All in the end.[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Come on Mary, Mary or you, John,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
To which religion do you belong?[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
You and your lover, you and your friend,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
Peace in the end.[/tab]

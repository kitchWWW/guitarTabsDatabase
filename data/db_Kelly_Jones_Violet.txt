Tabbed by: Leo C

Before I begin, I'd just like to say that I've just bought this album and, although very
and somewhat empty, it strikes me as being a very beautiful, lyric-orientated album. A
no-one has tabbed this song out, as it is one of my favourite lyrically. And all of the 
I have seen for the other songs on this album are spot on. Well done people!

VIOLET

Of course, you can play theses notes lower down the fretboard or higher...this is just
I started to play the song. Plus, by playing this way It gives you free-reign to mess
with major-minor switches which you can add into the song if it pleases you.

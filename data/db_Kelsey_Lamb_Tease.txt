TEASE
As recorded by Kelsey Lamb
(2025 release)


[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I'm nervous, replaying this whole night's conversation[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
Been looking so long and we've got so much in common[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I told all my friends about you[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Nice guys are so hard to find[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
It all felt so perfect, so imagine my surprise[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
When you drop me off, you get the door[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
You walk me up to my front porch[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Thought I could get used to this[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
But you changed it with a single kiss[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
I want someone who takes his time[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
You want me to take you inside[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Say I led you on[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
So which one of us is wrong?[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Dm7[/ch]
You're not the man I thought I knew[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
So if I'm a tease, what does that make you?[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
'Cause you had me convinced that this was real and you were different[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Now you're angry, I know it[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
You want me to notice[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Acting like I owe you something[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Just 'cause you bought a couple drinks[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
And damn, I feel so stupid[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
What would your momma think if she could see[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
You drop me off, you get the door[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
You walk me up to my front porch[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Thought I could get used to this[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
But you changed it with a single kiss[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
I want someone who takes his time[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
You want me to take you inside[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Say I led you on[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
So which one of us is wrong?[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Dm7[/ch]
You're not the man I thought I knew[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]Dm7[/ch]
So if I'm a tease, what does that make you?[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
I could think of some words but why even bother?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Maybe you'll get it someday if you ever have a daughter[/tab]


[Out-Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
And he drops her off, he gets the door[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]
He walks her up to your front porch[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am7[/ch]
She's crying when she turns the key[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I hope you remember me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
I want someone who takes his time[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
You want me to take you inside[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Say I led you on[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
So which one of us is wrong?[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Dm7[/ch]
You're not the man I thought I knew[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
So if I'm a tease, what does that make you?[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Fm[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
How could I forget[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]
The way it was before we saw the end[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]
Sitting by the coastlines with no worries thinking[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                             [ch]Fm[/ch]
Where we'll be at thirty but what did I expect[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Made so many plans[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
The way we held the world in both our hands[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]
It all just got to big to take you with me now[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]
I'm spinning way too quickly[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Fm[/ch]
Guess we never had a chance[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]Dm7[/ch]
Don't let these moments slip by[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Time moves fast[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Em[/ch]
We both know that this wasn't made to last[/tab]

We're turning the page but we'll
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Always have these memories together[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Fm[/ch]
I love you doesn't mean it's forever[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Tell me what you want[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]
So I can do the same old but it all adds up[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]
Never want to dissapoint but lets face it[/tab]

We're both in different places
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
And with time, things come undone[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Show me what you need[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
Can't just all be sunsets on the beach[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
Cause I'll move across the country in a hurry[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]
While you're still there in Jersey[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Fm[/ch]
Please don't waste too much on me, so[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]Dm7[/ch]
Don't let these moments slip by[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Time moves fast[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Em[/ch]
We both know that this wasn't made to last[/tab]

We're turning the page but we'll
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Always have these memories together[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Fm[/ch]
I love you doesn't mean it's forever[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
And life goes on[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Em[/ch]
But I'll still be singing your favourite songs[/tab]

It wont be the same but we'll
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Always have these memories together[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Fm[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
I love you doesn't mean it's forever[/tab]

[Interlude]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Fm[/ch]

[Outro]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Time moves fast[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Em[/ch]
We both know that this wasn't made to last[/tab]

We're too young but we'll
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Always have these memories together[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Fm[/ch]
I love you doesnt mean it's forever[/tab]

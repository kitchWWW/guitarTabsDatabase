[Intro] (x2)
[ch]Cmaj7[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]Cmaj7[/ch] 

[Verse 1]
[tab]   [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                  [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
As time passes, I feel so low[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Searchin' for pieces, covering up the holes[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]                                  [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I'll fight for your love, I'll fight for your soul[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am7[/ch]
I'll throw all of my cares away for you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
I'll be there to wait for you[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]               [ch]Dm7[/ch]
Maybe you weren't the one for me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am7[/ch]                       [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
But deep down I wanted you to be[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fmaj7[/ch]                    [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I'll still see you in my dreams[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]
So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am7[/ch]       [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Through my emotion[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I will be coasting, roller-coasting[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am7[/ch]               [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Fmaj7[/ch]                     [ch]Dm7[/ch]
Moving on seems harder to do[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am7[/ch]                                [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
When the one that you love moves faster than you[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]                          [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am7[/ch]                         [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]                  [ch]Dm7[/ch]
As time passes I'm feeling high[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am7[/ch]                         [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]                         [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                         [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Fmaj7[/ch]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]
Coasting, roller-coasting[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am7[/ch]            [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
In my emotions, oh[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I'll be coasting, roller-coasting[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am7[/ch]          [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
I noticed you weren't the one for me[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]    [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
You weren't the one for me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm7[/ch]
You weren't the one for me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am7[/ch]
You weren't the one for me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
You weren't the one for me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
Weren't the one for me[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Dm7[/ch]
You weren't the one[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am7[/ch]
You weren't the one for me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
So don't come back to me, no[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fmaj7[/ch]    [ch]Dm7[/ch]
   No, don't come back to me, no[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
   No, don't come back to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fmaj7[/ch]    [ch]Dm7[/ch]
   No, don't come back to me, no[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
   No, don't come back to me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
You weren't the one for me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm7[/ch]
You weren't the one for me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am7[/ch]
You weren't the one for me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
You weren't the one for me[/tab]

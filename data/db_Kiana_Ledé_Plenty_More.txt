[Verse 1]
[tab]                       [ch]F#maj7[/ch]
When you're out having sweet dreams[/tab]

I'll be your beautiful nightmare
[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
If you wonder what I mean, it's time for coming clean[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F#maj7[/ch]
Hope you feel it in the morning[/tab]

Realize I changed my number
[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
Yeah, it's more than you deserve but I'm feelin' kinda generous[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]G#m7[/ch]                        [ch]A#m[/ch]
I know I keep sayin' "I'ma leave, I'ma leave, I'ma leave,  I'ma leave you"[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]                           [ch]C#[/ch]
The truth is, I can't let it go, let it go, let it go, 'til we even, oh[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
I threw your shit out the window[/tab]

I made a mess of your condo
[tab]               [ch]F#maj7[/ch]
There's plenty more[/tab]

Plenty more where that came from

Plenty more where that came from
[tab]               [ch]B[/ch]
Might have to call up the po-po[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G#m[/ch]
Tell 'em your ex just went loco (Loco)[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A#m[/ch]
There's plenty more[/tab]

Plenty more where that came from

You don't want this no, you don't want none

Uh-uh-uh-uh

[ch]D#m[/ch]


[Verse 2]
[tab]                       [ch]F#maj7[/ch]
Smell her scent on the bedsheets[/tab]

And I ain't never had no blonde hair
[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
Can't deny the things I've seen[/tab]

Ain't smart enough to hide your screen
[tab]                      [ch]F#maj7[/ch]
Thought you knew me but you didn't[/tab]

Thought you would get away with murder (Oh no-no, no-no)
[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
Didn't think I'd have the nerve (Nerve)[/tab]

Now I keep smiling

Let it burn, burn


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]G#m7[/ch]                       [ch]A#m[/ch]
I know I keep sayin' "I'ma leave, I'ma leave, I'ma leave[/tab]

I'ma leave you"
[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]                         [ch]C#[/ch]
The truth is, I can't let it go, let it go, let it go 'til we even, oh[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]B[/ch]
I threw your shit out the window (Window)[/tab]

I made a mess of your condo (Condo)
[tab]               [ch]F#maj7[/ch]
There's plenty more[/tab]

Plenty more where that came from

Plenty more where that came from
[tab]               [ch]B[/ch]
Might have to call up the po-po (You might have to)[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G#m[/ch]
Tell them your bitch just went loco (Loco)[/tab]

Plenty more

Plenty more where that came from

You don't want this no, you don't want none


[Outro]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                  [ch]F#[/ch]
You don't want this, you don't want none[/tab]

CAPO 2nd Fret

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Fast, on a rough road riding[/tab]
High, through the mountains climbing
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
twisting, turning, further from my home.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Young, like a new moon rising[/tab]
Fierce, through the rain and lightning
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
Wandering out into this great unknown.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
And I dont want no one to cry, but tell em[/tab]
If I dont survive

Chorus
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I was born free[/tab]
I was born free
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I was born free, Born Free.[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Free, like a river raging[/tab]
Strong, is the wind Im facing.
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Chasing dreams and racing father time.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Deep, like the grandest canyon,[/tab]
Wild, like an untamed stallion.
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                           [ch]D[/ch]
If you cant see my heart you must be blind.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
You can knock me down and watch me bleed[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
But you cant keep no chains on me.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
And Im not good at long goodbyes but look down[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Deep into my eyes.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I was born free[/tab]

Instrumental
[ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Calm, facing danger[/tab]
Lost, like an unknown stranger
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
Grateful for my time with no regrets.[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Close, to my destination[/tab]
Tired, frail and aching
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
Waitin' patiently for the sun to set.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]                               
And when its done believe that I will yell it from that mountain high[/tab]

[chorus]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
And I will vow to the shining seas and celebrate Gods Grace on thee.[/tab]

 DANIEL (BABY BOY) by KIMYA DAWSON
-----------------------------------

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I was twelve and things had been[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Pretty okay up till then[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
The only deaths I’d experienced[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Were of pets and the grandparents of my friends[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I was in gifted and talented[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
Until right around the seventh grade[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
But that is when everything changed[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I had to flip a switch and shut off my brain[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
Cause if I thought too much[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
I’d get sick to my stomach[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
And I would feel like giving up[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
Or throwing up it was just too tough[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Cause that is when I realized that[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Even little babies die and[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I had to build a wall inside to[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Keep me from losing my mind[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He was only nine months old[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
A kid I’d babysit and hug and hold[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
And I would tickle his toes and pat his head[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
And watch his chest rise and fall as he slept in his crib[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
And then my dad said late last night[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
A drunk driver hit their car he didn’t survive[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
And his mom was hurt bad but his dad is alright[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
His big brother is fine cause he stayed at the party[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
Yeah yeah steven is fine cause he stayed at the party[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
And if I thought too much[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
I’d get sick to my stomach[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
And I would feel like giving up[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
Or throwing up it was just too tough[/tab]

[Verse 5]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
Sometimes things happen when we are small[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
That we just don’t have the tools to deal with at all[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
So we bottle them up and we just don’t see[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
How the stuff that we stuff will affect who we’ll be[/tab]

[Verse 6]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
What protects us as kids slowly makes us insane[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
So I’m trying to dismantle barricades[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Brick by brick in an attempt to set free my brain[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Brick by brick in an attempt to set free my brain[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
And I just hope that my heart is stronger now[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
So much stronger than it was when I was twelve[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
When if I thought too much[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
I’d get sick to my stomach[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
And I would feel like giving up[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
Or throwing up it was just too tough[/tab]

[Verse 7]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
And I’d sing ‘Daniel’ again and again[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
And pretend you were just traveling on a plane[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Quarter century later it’s still hard to take[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
But with every red tail light I scream out your name[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
Yeah with every red tail light I scream out your name[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
Yeah with every red tail light I scream out your name[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
I say ‘Daniel, Daniel, Daniel’[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
I say ‘Daniel, Daniel, Daniel’[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
I say ‘Daniel, Daniel, Daniel’[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
Baby boy, baby boy, baby boy[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
Baby boy, baby boy, baby boy[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
Baby boy, baby boy, baby boy[/tab]

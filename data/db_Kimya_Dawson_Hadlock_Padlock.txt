Hadlock Padlock
Kimya Dawson

A nice simple song, 4 basic chords.
On the second verse an extra C is added between the last D and G.
Sometimes playing with the backing something sounds different... not entirely wrong,
different. However stand alone these chords enable you to play this great song.

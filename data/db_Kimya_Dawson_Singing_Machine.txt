[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  (x2)

[Verse 1]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
We switched to Jay Leno from da Ali G show[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
to see some kids that we know do what they do on TV.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Sometimes I wish I was there, but mostly I just don't care,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
I cry and laugh and forth and back, it's all good comedy,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
and there's no rhyme or reason for the changing of the seasons,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                                        [ch]C[/ch]
sometimes the winter lasts for months, sometimes it lasts for days.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
The world is an amazing place, there's gaping holes in outer space,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
sunburned for the first time skin is peeling off my face.[/tab]

[Chorus 1]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
And Bruno said what Anders said, some producer said to young Lennon[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
"They can't all be ballads, Julian".[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
And Bruno said what Anders said, some producer said to young Lennon[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
"They can't all be ballads, Julian".[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
O-o-open up your eyes and see the beauty over there.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Open up our ears and be surprised by what you hear,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
'cause it's not just on the radio, it's not just on the video,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
it isn't all downloadable, there's music everywhere,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
and the fact that they divide us should be enough to unite us,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                                       [ch]C[/ch]
we are the world, so boys and girls, let's all collaborate,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
'cause when we play together, we won't notice the bad weather,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
like flashlight tag when it's real cold or kickball in the rain.[/tab]

[Chorus 1]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
And Bruno said what Anders said, some producer said to young Lennon[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
"They can't all be ballads, Julian".[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
you're barely nineteen, you're a singing machine.[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Doesn't matter what you look like, doesn't matter what you sound like,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
doesn't matter if they like you, just remember to be kind,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
and tell someone you miss them, and tell someone you need them,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
and tell someone you wish you could be with them all the time,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
sounds silly but it's not a game, making music makes me sane,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
I sing away my pain and everything turns out okay,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
and I'm not talking fame and glory, 'cause that's a different story,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
this story is about how truth and love can save the day[/tab]

[Chorus 2]

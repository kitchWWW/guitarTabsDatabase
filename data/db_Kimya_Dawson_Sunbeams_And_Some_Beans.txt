And the weatherman said to my friend, "What's your name?"[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F[/ch]
My friend said, "Write yours down, mine is almost the same."[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Erase the "S" and "M" in their place put a "G" and "R"[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
And an "ND" look at me what's that say[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Then the weatherman stood with his head hung in shame[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
He took off his big belt, put it down, turned away[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But my friend said, "Don't leave, I just harvested beets, [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
let's go eat at my place."[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
With his mouth full the weatherman stared at his plate[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
And he knew it was his heart that made my friend great[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Not his muscles, his money, his job or his name or his fame[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
See my friend isn't famous[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He is just a good person who grows what he eats[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
And if you have a mouth then he will try to feed you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And if you are cold he'll put wood in the stove[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Grab a quilt and some warm flannel sheets[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
So the Grand Champion called up Sam Champion[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Said, "Let's plant a garden in the heart of this wasteland."[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And Sam said, "Hey man, this'll be breaking news,"[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
but Grand said, "I won't wait for your camera crews.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
See, I don't do what I do for the glory.[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
I do what I do because it's a good story.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I do what I do because there is a need and a [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
hunger aided by corporate greed.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
See there's a surplus of food in this country,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
And nobody should ever go to sleep hungry,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But that food is kept under lock and key[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Considered a privilege for people with money."[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Then the weatherman dropped to his hands his knees[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
With a tear in his eye and unable to speak[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He was driven to action by only compassion[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
He dug in the dirt and he planted some beans[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Planted some beans[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Planted some beans[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Planted some beans[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Planted some beans[/tab]

(no playing here)
Grandma said to me
If you only have one bean
And you meet someone with no bean
You should give them half your bean
Cause you will be less hungry
If you eat just half a bean
Than if you eat a whole bean in front of somebody with no bean.

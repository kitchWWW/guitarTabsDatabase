[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
This place is a jungle[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
When I saw you in the trees[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
I was so happy[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I stayed in bed for a week[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
I said things were too good[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
You told me every dog has his day[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
If you want me to be your dog[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Then next time you have to say[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
I'm sorry but we're through[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
'Spose you had to pick and choose[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
I'm sure there's more where I came from[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
I'm sorry but we're through[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
'Spose you had to pick and choose[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Did I resent you putting me to the test?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Call me a bad loser but the answer's frankly yes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
We went to sleep as one and then woke up as two[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
But I'll be honest I had nothing better to do[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
I'm sorry but we're through[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
'Spose you had to pick and choose[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
All that's lost was mine[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
I'm sorry but we're through[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]

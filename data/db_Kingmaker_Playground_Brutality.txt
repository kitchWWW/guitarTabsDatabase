I can't understand why nobody has had the urge to tab any Kingmaker
stuff.
And so when I found out that the most desirable 'femme fatale' in the
universe was into them - I got some urges!! [not for the first time
either!]

This one's for the 'lurverly' Gisele.

    The falling of your tears
    Was the best environmental news
    We've had in years
    'round here

    Everything looks vulgar - sometimes
    I'll write that out
    A hundred times
    Coughing up the chalk dust
    I wonder why

    Unhappy hour
    Begins at twelve
    And my punishment doesn't just stop
    With the final bell

    Is any body there?
    Is anybody out there?
    Is any body there?
    Is anybody out there?
    Is any body there?
    Is anybody out there?
    Does anybody care?
    Is anybody out there?
    Nobody in the whole work seems to care

If you can tab faster than a paralysed slug, then give us a hand with
the next bit.
Or alternatively, if you think you know how to play the intro properly,
tell me.

e-mail me if you like:
James, Happy Mondays, The Charlatans, Radiohead, Ash, Inspiral Carpets.
etc.

Inform me of the coolest / your favourite solos too.

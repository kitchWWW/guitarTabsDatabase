 [Verse 1]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
 I done came down, hold up, grip the grain, roll up[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]    
 And your girlfriend want a nigga like me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
 'cause I ain't trying to control her[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
 She call me when she wants a change[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
 Black diamond, my pinky ring[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
 And she know you weak and we ain't the same[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
 You hit the scene, I make the scene[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
 I'm in her head like Maybelline[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
 H-town so I made to lean[/tab]
 I'm in her soul, I make her scream
 I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
 I'm easy tag like peter pan
 She want a man, don't need a man
 I'm flying down your boulevard
 She cooking dinner with your pans
 Draped up, dripped out,
 Your bitch know what I'm taking 'bout
 Pulls up, pull out
 We get it poppin' in the parking lot
 She like to do it with the lights on
 Don't matter to me if it's dark or not
 I'm g'd up, east up
 Fossil pants, I'm hard as rock
 
[Hook]
 Girl I know how much you really want somebody
 Want somebody that don't really need you
 Girl I know how much you really want somebody
 Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
 You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
 That ain't trying to love you baby, just fuck you instead
 And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm coming baby
 Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
 Got this drank in my cup
 Oh yeah
 I got this drank in my cup (this drank)
 I got this drank in my cup (this drank)
 Cup, cup..
 
[Verse 2]
 I done came down, came up
 Slow pitch, change up
 Same hood, same style
 Same drink, same cup
 She call me when she wanna fuck
 I never call, she knows what's up
 Same page, same book
 Different song, same hook
 Every time her nigga tripping
 She on the phone with the same crook
 And every time I pull up
 She hit me with that same look
 Lips biting, hips right
 She left her man for that get right
 I'm in the middle, like midnight
 But only if you got that sip tight
 Only if you got that wine fine
 Only if you got that sip tight
 Only if you got that mind bomb
 Only if you got that zip tight
 Eat that shit like won ton
 Joking baby, I'm pimp type
 I'm used to being that one and done
 But girl you got that (g-get right)
 
[Hook]
 
[Outro]
 [drink pouring]
 H-town
 Oh yeah
 I got this drink in my cup
 I got this drink in my cup
 (cup, cup, cup)
 I came down, hold up
 Hold up, I said hold up
 Hold up, I done came down like hold up
 Hold up, hold up... fuck, shit

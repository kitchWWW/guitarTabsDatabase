[ch]Em[/ch]...

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Oh hello, how are you, my favorite son? [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]    
In an hour I will go where I've never gone [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]    
In the span of the space between your mother's eyes [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]          
are the secrets that I've saved [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
I hand them down to you [/tab]


[tab][ch]A[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
oooooh. The averages and laws, [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
it was every man for himself every child alone [/tab]


[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]    
Oh why do they shine so bright in my dreams? [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Golden blades, forged from love, they sever my feet [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]               
but you know, where I'm going, when all is said and done [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
I don't need them or my secrets [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Just the grace of one [/tab]


[tab][ch]C[/ch]
here they come [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
here they come [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
here they come... [/tab]

oh hear they come! [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
is everything signed? Is everything done? [/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm sorry about the blood [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
...the devil and his stones [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
It was every man for himself, every child alone[/tab]


[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Please tell your mother I'm sorry for the strife [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]           
tell your brother I loved him [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
...the same to his wife [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]    
and if you have a heart to take my life away [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
give me something, give me anger to remember you today [/tab]


[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]
'Cause here they come [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
oh here they come [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Is everything signed? Can nothing be undone? [/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
I'm sorry about the blood [/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]*
...the devil and his stones  [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
It was every man for himself, every child alone...[/tab]



C* - Sounds like its a C chord with the d string open. (lift your middle 
finger off) it sounds fine either way, but i think its slightly more 
accurate to the song this way.

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Gsus2[/ch]
Well I guess I oughta make my way downtown[/tab]
[tab][ch]Csus2[/ch]
Quit all the drugs and stop foolin' around[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
Go back to church and start reading again[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Maybe God will forgive all my sins[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Gsus2[/ch]
And I'll start back over where it all began[/tab]
[tab][ch]Csus2[/ch]
Late drunken nights, all the whiskey and gin[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
A half lit cigarette and a cocaine flame[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
A woman that doesn't even know my name[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Gsus2[/ch]
A beat up old car with wood pannel sides[/tab]
[tab][ch]Csus2[/ch]
A two pack habit, just tryin' to survive[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
A wife and two kids that I left alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Praying that one day that I'll just come home[/tab]

[Chours 1]
[tab][ch]Csus2[/ch]
Maybe one day I will finally grow up[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gsus2[/ch]
And maybe one day I'll quit messing up[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                        [ch]Em7[/ch]
Maybe I won't or maybe I'll just let you down[/tab]

[ch]Gsus2[/ch]  [ch]Csus2[/ch]  [ch]Em7[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]Gsus2[/ch]
And I'll go down to the pawn shop and grab my old guitar[/tab]
[tab][ch]Csus2[/ch]
And head down to mainstreet to play that old bar[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
Just play for tips and not make a dime[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Maybe I'll realize that I'm still alive[/tab]

[Verse 5]
[tab][ch]Gsus2[/ch]
And I'll go buy a coke, Some candy and some smokes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Csus2[/ch]
I'll walk down the street and laugh at my own jokes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
Maybe I'll busk on the corner for some cash[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
God I don't know how much longer I will last[/tab]

[Chorus 2]
[tab][ch]Csus2[/ch]
Maybe one day I will finally grow up[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gsus2[/ch]
And maybe one day I'll quit messin up[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                        [ch]Em7[/ch]
Maybe I won't or maybe I'll just let you down[/tab]

[ch]Csus2[/ch]  [ch]Gsus2[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Em7[/ch]

[Chorus 3]

Maybe one day I'll quit messin up[/tab]

Artist: Kris Allen
Song: No Boundaries
Genre: 
Key: 


(The F#ø7 means "F sharp half-diminished" and can also be played Am/F# for the capo 
and then Cm/A for the non-capo version. It is a very spooky chord and very fun to play and 
100% correct! Also, the E7/Ab chord is just a passing chord, you can also play it as an Abº chord.)
THESE ARE THE CORRECT CHORDS FOR REAL!!!!!


No Boundaries: Kris Allen (AMERICAN IDOL WINNER)

CAPO: 3

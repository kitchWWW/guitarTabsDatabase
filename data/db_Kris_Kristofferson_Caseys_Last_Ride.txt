[Verse 1]

[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
        Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]
        The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
        Following their footsteps through the neon darkened corridors[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
        Of silent desperation,never speaking to a soul[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
        The poison air he's breathing has a dirty smell of dying[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Dm[/ch]                                [ch]E[/ch]
        Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
        But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
        Of the clicking of the turnstile and the rattle of his chains[/tab]


[Bridge 1]

[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                                                     [ch]G[/ch]
        "Oh", she said "Casey it's been so long since I've seen you"[/tab]
[tab]                                                       [ch]C[/ch]
        "Here", she said "Just a kiss to make a body smile"[/tab]
[tab]                                                                   [ch]G[/ch]
        "See", she said "I've put on new stockings just to please you"[/tab]
[tab]                                                     [ch]C[/ch]
        "Lord", she said "Casey can you only stay a while"[/tab]


[Verse 3]

[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
        Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the golden crown[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]
        For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
        Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
        Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home[/tab]


[Verse 4]

[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
        Standing in the corner,Casey drinks his pint of bitter[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Dm[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
        Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
        Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
        Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye[/tab]


[Bridge 2]

[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                                              [ch]G[/ch]
        "Oh", she said "I suppose you seldom think about me"[/tab]
[tab]                                                           [ch]C[/ch]
        "Now", she said "Now that you've a family of your own"[/tab]
[tab]                                                              [ch]G[/ch]
        "Still", she said "It's so blessed good to feel your body"[/tab]
[tab]                                                      [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
        "Lord", she said "Casey it's a shame to be alone"[/tab]

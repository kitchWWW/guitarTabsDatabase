Here it is another beautiful song by Kris...

With the faith of my father[/tab]

I let a stranger[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
Into my home[/tab]

            
And right there before me

[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
And I've seen him hold her[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
With his head on her shoulder[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]
Singing her love songs[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
Soft as her smile[/tab]

I know the story[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
I read the papers[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
I see the anger[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]
I feel it too[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
But when I see the wonder[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
In the smiles of my children[/tab]

Worth coming true[/tab]

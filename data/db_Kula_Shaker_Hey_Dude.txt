		Kula Shaker: "Hey Dude"
		  from the album "K"


	This is how I play this awesome song. It might not be entirely
	correct, but it sounds really good to me. As always, listen to
	the recording to get the rhythm right.

Intro:

[ch]Gm[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Csus4[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]

	The verse follows this pattern, but in the recording it's
	played with bass only. The timing of the singing is really weird,
	so once again, listen to the cd.
	Strum mosty on the 4 highest strings during the verse.


[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]		        [ch]Csus4[/ch]	     [ch]C[/ch]
All I have is all I need enough for love but not for greed yeah[/tab]

(same as above:)
I was younger once this guy came to me told me about all the honey out there
He said 'honey gold jewels money women wine cars that shine'
I don't know what he was talking about but I think I had an idea
He said 'smell the rose, sweet sweet rose, catch the sun find where it grows,
Smell the rose, the sweet rose that grows on castle walls in heaven',

In heaven yeah

Well if it feels like summer you're catching the sun, and I'm
catching the moment you fall,
If it tastes like honey don't swallow it all,
don't wait for the moment to come


[tab][ch]Eb7[/ch]                  [ch]F7[/ch]
   And catch the sun[/tab]


Chorus:

[tab][ch]C[/ch]      [ch]Eb[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]Bb[/ch]
  Hey dude, don't lean on me man[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
Cause I'm losing my direction and I can't understand, no no no[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]      [ch]Eb[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]Bb[/ch]
  Hey dude, well I do what I can[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
But you treat me like a woman when I feel like a man[/tab]

Verse:

[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Csus4[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
I was crossing the city one day, everybody was flashing by me[/tab]

Like images of tombstones, images of tombstones,
On a Friday night I've seen everybody looking for their little bit of honey
To alleviate the pain, to alleviate the pain
Well if it feels like summer don't burn in the sun,
don't wait for the evening fall,
If it tastes like honey don't swallow it all,
don't wait for the moment to come

[tab][ch]Eb7[/ch]                  [ch]F7[/ch]
   And catch the sun[/tab]


Chorus, and then:


[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]Ab[/ch]
No, n no, n no, n no, n no, n no, n no, n no, n no no, n no[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]Ab[/ch]
I can't understand... when I feel like a man, sing it to me honey![/tab]

	Then there's the little riff before the solo:

  			    [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]|-3--1-----------------|-------1--------------|
|-------3p1------------|-1--3----3--1---------|
|--------------h3--0---|---------------3------|
|----------------------|----------------------|      x 2
|----------------------|----------------------|
|----------------------|----------------------|[/tab]

(Both this riff and the solo are played over the verse chords.)


Solo (sorry, I didn't tab that one)

Chorus

Ending (with chorus chords)


	Chord Formations:

     A          5 7 7 6 5 5
     Ab         4 6 6 5 4 4
     Bb         6 8 8 7 6 6 (verse)

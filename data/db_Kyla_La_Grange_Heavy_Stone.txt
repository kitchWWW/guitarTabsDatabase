CAPO 3
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Bitten by the wind on a hard hard day[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
 And God I really want you to stay[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
 Bitten by tears and a burning fear[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
 That had smeared us both on the table[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
And there are too many people in this street[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
 There are too many eyes to meet[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
 So I hold your wrist and I feel you listless[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
 Shaking on the edge of your seat[/tab]


[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]  ,  [ch]C[/ch]  ,  [ch]G[/ch] , [ch]D[/ch]  X3
Oh hide me safe away I want to see myself[/tab]
 Painted an invisible gray.
 Feed me to the years and I will make myself
 Harmless as a drawn-on tear
 Please don’t hold me in your soul like a heavy stone,

[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
 I am carrying my cold heart home.[/tab]


[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Trapped by a breath and it hit my head[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
 like a thousend bricks from the sky[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
 And I saw you choke as the last bridge broke[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
  And our fingers waved goodbye[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
There are too many clowns stumbling by[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
 There are too many hand to untie[/tab]


[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
 So we leave it there by the tin can chairs[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
 And the pavement swallows our lives[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]  ,  [ch]C[/ch]  ,  [ch]G[/ch] , [ch]D[/ch]  X3
Oh hide me safe away I want to see myself[/tab]
 Painted an invisible gray.
 Feed me to the years and I will make myself
 Harmless as a drawn-on tear
 Please don’t hold me in your soul like a heavy stone,

[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]  X2
   I am carrying my cold heart home[/tab]
   I am carrying my cold heart home

[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]  X4
Your face has followed me home[/tab]
 With unwanted grace I leave you lonely
 We were never made a perfect piece to fit
 We will remain unfinished puzzles as we seat


[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]  ,  [ch]C[/ch]  ,  [ch]G[/ch] , [ch]D[/ch]  X3
Oh hide me safe away I want to see myself[/tab]
 Painted an invisible gray.
 Feed me to the years and I will make myself
 Harmless as a drawn-on tear
 Please dont hold me in your soul like a heavy stone,

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]  X5
 I am carrying my cold heart home[/tab]
 I am carrying my cold heart home
 I am carrying my cold heart home
 I am carrying my cold heart home
 I am carrying my cold heart home

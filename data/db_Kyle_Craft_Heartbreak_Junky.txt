[Verse 1]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
So you fell in love and it wasn't with me[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Hey that's fine, it's about time I let go[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
But whatever curse you put here in me[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Well can you lift it babe before I hit the road?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
You were a charmer, I was a heartbreak junky[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
You were a diamond, I was the heap of fool's gold[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
You were the jet plane, I was the parachute failing[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I was the cheap ad when you were the centerfold[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Cm[/ch]
Then my sun set hard on Carolina[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Cm[/ch]
Where she howled about the Pender county line[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Cm[/ch]
And her six-string fingers ran the length of some boy's body[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Cm[/ch]
In younger dreams I thought that body might be mine[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
You were a cold crush, I was a heartbreak junky[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Now you're a mother and I'm a flashback son[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah I'm a wasteland, you've got all your milk and honey[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
And back then I swore you were the only one[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
So disenchant me baby, I've been dying to know how to give up, get out, stay gone[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Make me not wanna go back to the girl that I had before, she was so sweet baby so sweet[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe I can reconcile what I ripped in two[/tab]
[tab]                                                    [ch]C[/ch]
That haphazard, half-hearted love I was making with you[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Cm[/ch]
Yeah, I made it with you.[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
But now the bars are closed and the city sleeps tight[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
As I ramble home my wretched merry way[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
Where down was up and feeling bad felt so right.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
I thought that vertigo was here to stay[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
We're talking hellfire, but at the time, it seemed funny[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
When all the demons left the woodwork to play[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
With an angel and a heartbreak junky[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Stuck in their rock bottom masquerade[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
So disconnect me baby, I've been dying to know how to give up, get out, stay gone[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Make me not wanna go back to the girl that I had before, she was so sweet baby, so sweet[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe I can reconcile what I ripped in two[/tab]
[tab]                                                    [ch]C[/ch]
That haphazard, half-hearted love I was making with you[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Cm[/ch]
Yeah, I made it with you.[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
So when Eden burns behind you in the rearview[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]
and you're off to find a stranger paradise[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
Where you can sing your own way out[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Well, you know that I'll be around[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]Cm[/ch]
with a sweet-talk woman fading slowly[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
on a lovesick mind[/tab]

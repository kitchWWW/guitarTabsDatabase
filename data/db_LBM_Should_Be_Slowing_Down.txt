Should be Slowing Down
Written by LBM
From the album 'Songs from the north of the heart'

---------------------------------------------------------------------
This is one of many great songs written by LBM.
This song has a very David Gray feel to it, its a lyrical
masterpiece in my opinion, Compared to some songs we are
subjected to nowadays.(it also rings very true!)

Verse 2

Time on your own, bored to the bone, its not the place for one
Desire and lust, a partners a must, but all the best have gone
Take to the road, lighten the load, with your memories driftin? by
Stop for a break, it?s for your own sake, but you've never time to cry

Chorus


Bridge Part 1 (as verse)

Gear number five, makes you feel alive, but when you gonna realise
That gear number two maybe best for you, in someone else?s eyes

Bridge Part 2 (Played as verse but slowed down to 2 bars per one
chord in the verse)

Because it's all speed and greed theres no time to wait
Heading full on to an unknown fate
Tying knots too soon, bride or groom, should wait until their older.
Too many the same, such a shame, their leaning without a shoulder.

Chorus then repeated twice in full, finishes quietly with:

[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]*                       [ch]F[/ch]*
Na na nah, na na nah nah, na na nah nah nah nah nah[/tab]

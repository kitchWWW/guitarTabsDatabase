Artist: LISA (BLACKPINK)
Song: Dream
Genre: 
Key: Eb


It's optional doing the sevenths in the chorus (Cm7 and Fm7) and can just be played normally (Cm and Fm),
I just think it sounds great!

This is how I play some of the chords since I'm on electric, but by no means the "official" way:

[Verse 1]
[tab]          [ch]Eb[/ch]
I've been thinking[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Eb/D[/ch]
That I got no idea what you're thinking, are you happy? Are you sad?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm7b5[/ch]        [ch]G7[/ch]               [ch]Cm[/ch]
Are you always gonna hate me for that night in Tokyo?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb[/ch]                                     [ch]Eb/D[/ch]
When it ended, I kinda hoped that it'd be open-ended, but you never looked back[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm7b5[/ch]                [ch]G7[/ch]              [ch]Cm[/ch]
Well, I guess you can't hold on to something once you let it go[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]Ab[/ch]
But I know a place where we can be us[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I know it ain't real, but it's real enough[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Fm[/ch]
From sun going down to sun coming up[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bb7[/ch]
It's like you're here with me[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
Whenever I close my eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb/D[/ch]
It's taking me back in time[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm7b5[/ch]            [ch]G7[/ch]           [ch]Cm7[/ch]
Been drowning in dreams lately, like it's 2019, baby[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
Whenever I'm missing you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb/D[/ch]
Call you up, but I can't get through[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm7b5[/ch]                [ch]G7[/ch]
Don't know where you sleep lately[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm7[/ch]
But I'll see you in my dreams, maybe[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]                     [ch]Bb/Ab[/ch]
We can catch up, drive down our old street[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Gm[/ch]                  [ch]C/E[/ch]                 [ch]Fm7[/ch]
If all that we were is all that we'll ever be[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Fdim[/ch]
It's bittersweet[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Eb[/ch]
At least a girl can dream[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
I guess that I'm taking what I can get[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Eb/D[/ch]
'Cause I don't get nothing new from your friends[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]Dm7b5[/ch]
If you got the harder side of the break[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G7[/ch]
Then why is it harder for me to take?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Cm[/ch]
There's so much I might never get to say-ay[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]Ab[/ch]
But I know a place where we can be us[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I know it ain't real, but it's real enough[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Fm[/ch]
From sun going down to sun coming up[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bb7[/ch]
It's like you're here with me[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
Whenever I close my eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb/D[/ch]
It's taking me back in time[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Bdim[/ch]        [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]Adim[/ch]
I, I know it's only in my mind (Ooh)[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Ab[/ch]
Playin' three nights on the stereo[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Like a movie scene, DiCaprio[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Bdim[/ch]     [ch]Bb[/ch]             [ch]Adim[/ch]     [ch]Fm[/ch]
Oh, I, I put my makeup on just to fall asleep (Ah)[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bb[/ch]
It's like you're here with me[/tab]

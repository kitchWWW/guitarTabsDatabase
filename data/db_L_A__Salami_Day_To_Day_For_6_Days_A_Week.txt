Day To Day (For 6 Days A Week)
L.A. Salami

more like his playing. You can strum to rest and
it will still sound good.



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Took the bus, took the train[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Went to work, ignored the pain[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
What a rainy day, unfriendly faces[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Got dragged around all types of places.[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Closed my eyes, smelt your hair[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Looked around, but you weren't there[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Had some lunch, jacket potatos[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Chicken wings and fried tomatoes.[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
After that, lit a fag, said a prayer and took a drag;[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
These days I toast never do combust so much,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I burn for the both of us though.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Second day, second job -[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
passing thought for the world to stop -[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Shoes are too tight feet are aching -[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Called in sick but I was faking…[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
When I do go I am late, always make the same mistake;[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
That mistake being not caring - 6 days a week -[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Can’t find my bearings…[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But to be fair, I might have cared -[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Might have cared if you were there[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Might have cared if you were there[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Might have cared if you were there[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Stressed as hell, fatigued as fuck,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Putrid passion, rotten luck;[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Worked to death, chomping at the bit -[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Crazed as Christ and broke as shit.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Watched the news, someone died -[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Saw the mother, teary eyed -[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Son shot dead on Walworth Road -[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I thank god no one I know…[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Went to work for the NHS -[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Mental health, people depressed.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Met Joanne - Scared of living,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Afraid of dying, terrified of being.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Then met Paul, a schizophrenic,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Shaking limbs, paranoid fanatic -[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Unwashed 10 days in a row -[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
So afraid almost paralytic.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I tell them that I do the same -[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
In certain moods, on certain days…[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
But despite the sane ways I can think[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I could not do much to convince them…[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Back to base, had a meeting -[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
2 kids die a week because their parent beat them.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I wish I could say I was surprised[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
The news just choose which ones to highlight…[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
…Choose which ones to highlight…[/tab]


G  (Improvise off the G chord)


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Took the DLR, took the tube,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Read a book, nothing else to do…[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Read Gill Hicks, she survived the bombings -[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Wrote a book… made a killing…[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I read somewhere that some lost their legs,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Umpteen injured, 52 dead.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
In some places far away, that shit happens every day.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Now scared of buses, scared of trains,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But got to get to work someway…[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
So I play with my life, you could say.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
…But don’t we all? Don’t we all?…[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
…Don’t we all? Don’t we all?[/tab]


[ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]


[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I got a gig, got myself booked,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Just down the road where Nick got jooked.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I get to sing my joys and sorrows -[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Not made it yet… maybe tomorrow…[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Closed my eyes, saw your face,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Looked around, you were no place…[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
… I feel so left out when you’re not around…[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
… I feel so left out when you’re not around…[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But you are Time, and I am Life,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And time’s a tyrant unto strife -[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
And strife’s the type of life I seem to lead,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And time won’t heal this wound easily.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Take your light, your shadowed passions,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I hear your talk, I see your actions;[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
What I don’t see are your eyes,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Those flaming symbols of the night.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Was that your skin that I saw[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
On the road my ruin wore?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Were you wearing that paisley I adore?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Were you hatred? Were you lust?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You understand this, ‘cause you must -[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
That men have the consistencies[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Of love and war through history…[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I must see you, I must know,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Did you falter, did you go?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Did you go?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Did you go?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Did you go?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Did you go?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Did you go?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Did you go?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Did you go?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Did you go?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Did you go?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Did you go?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Did you go?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Did you go?[/tab]

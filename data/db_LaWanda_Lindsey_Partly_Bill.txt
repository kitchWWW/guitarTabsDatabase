[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
There was an emptiness within my life[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Along about the time he came along[/tab]

And so, I guess that you could say that
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
When he came along, he came on pretty strong[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
Cause back then suddenly it seemed to me[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
That emptiness within me had been filled[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
And when I wondered what the reasons were,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
I had to answer at least partly Bill[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
   Partly Bill (partly Bill) partly Bill[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I can remember hearing music with[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
The pretty words of love he had to say[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And I recall the times of laughter[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
After love it comes the thirst has passed away[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
He was the only real fulfillment[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
That the world has shown me yet and even still[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
I know that I'm a different person[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
And the part of me is surely partly Bill[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
  Partly Bill (partly Bill) partly Bill[/tab]

(Key change)

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
    But then the sad part of the story came[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C#[/ch]                [ch]G#[/ch]
When Bill just seemed to lose his love for me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
And when he left me the effect on me[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C#[/ch]        [ch]G#[/ch]
Was plain enough for anyone to see[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D#[/ch]                          [ch]C#[/ch]
But then when everybody asked me what was on my mind[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G#[/ch]
I shyly answered them[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C#[/ch]              [ch]D#[/ch]
I said it's not a great big problem[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C#[/ch]             [ch]D#[/ch]               [ch]G#[/ch]
But I will admit the problem's partly him[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]        [ch]G#[/ch]          [ch]F#[/ch]          [ch]G#[/ch]
    Partly him (partly him) partly Bill[/tab]

(Key change)

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
    Now here I am and everybody thinks[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
I'm all alone with no one to call mine[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
But I don't feel my life is empty[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
All I need is just the passing of some time[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]
I've got a special feeling deep inside me[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
Telling me that he is with me still[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
And when the baby grows up strong and tall[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
I'll tell them all[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
That he is partly Bill[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
   Partly Bill (partly Bill) partly Bill[/tab]

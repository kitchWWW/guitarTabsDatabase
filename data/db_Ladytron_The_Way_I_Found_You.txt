[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]             
up on the stand, the society meeting[/tab]
 
[tab][ch]Em[/ch](7th fret)
that was the way, was the way that I found you[/tab]
 
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
drunk after work, here in the late night feelings[/tab]
 
[tab][ch]Em[/ch](7th fret)
that was the way, was the way that I found you[/tab]
 
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
sat in the crowd, watching the women's tennis[/tab]
 
[tab][ch]Em[/ch](7th fret)
that was the way, was the way that I found you[/tab]
 
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
saw who you were, picking up from the canvas[/tab]
 
[tab][ch]Em[/ch](7th fret)
that was the way; I was wrapped around you,[/tab]
 
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]C#m[/ch]
met you while you were switching on[/tab]
 
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
and checked your box on the blue coupon[/tab]
 
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]    [ch]F#[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
that was how...I...found...[/tab]

 
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch] 
sat in the crowd, watching the women's tennis[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch](7th fret) 
that was the way, was the way that I found you[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch] 
saw who you were, picking up from the canvas[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch](7th fret) 
that was the way; I was wrapped around you[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]C#m[/ch]
you still don't know what I want[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
picked up your book in a street kiosk[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]    [ch]F#[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
that was how...I...found...[/tab]

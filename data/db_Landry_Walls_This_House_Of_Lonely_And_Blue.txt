I come here every night and see the same old faces[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Sometimes I see someone new[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
I wonder what they are all looking for[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
I guess it's a place to hide all their blues[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
The musics so loud you can hardly hear[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
The smoke so thick you can cut it with a knife[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
the jukebox plays the same old sad songs[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
About some guy leaving his wife[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Is it love, is it life, are they just getting by[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
They can run, they can hide from all the reasons why[/tab]

If they wanted to
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
But they could never escape this house of lonely and blue[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
You know it's kind of funny, I'm the face that I see[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
I guess I'm looking for a place to run too[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
I'm no different from the rest of them[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
I can't escape this house of lonely and blue[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Is it love, is it life, am I just getting by[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
I can run, I can hide from all the reasons why[/tab]

If I wanted to
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
But I could never escape this house of lonely and blue[/tab]

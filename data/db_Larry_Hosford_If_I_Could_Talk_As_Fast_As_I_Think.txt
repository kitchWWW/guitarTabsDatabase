[Verse 1]
(Guy)
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
If I could talk just as fast as I think[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A#[/ch]
I'd have you quick as a wink[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Cause I think I'm a feller you ought to know better[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A#[/ch]          [ch]Gm[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
And I'd like to buy you a drink[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
And the thing we ought to be doin'[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A#[/ch]
Is sittin' here pitchin' and a wooin'[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
Well I could say some things that would tickle you pink[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]F#[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
If I could talk as fast as I think[/tab]

[Verse 3]
(Girl)
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
If you could do everything that you say[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
You might get the time of day[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
But so far buddy your lines are all muddy[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
And I wish you'd just go away[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I can handle insistence[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
But kindly please keep your distance[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
And as long as you're here you might as well stay[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
If you can do everything that you say[/tab]

[Chorus]
(Both)
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Let's keep talkin' all night[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
We're a man and a woman, at least that's right[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And these days you can't take a chance[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
At just anything walkin' in pants[/tab]

[Instrumental]
[ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]A#[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Gm[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]A#[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]A#[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]

[Verse 5]
(Guy)
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
If I could walk just as fast as I talk[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A#m[/ch]                  [ch]A#[/ch]
I'd amble you out to the dock[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
And we'd watch all the fishes and make a few wishes[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A#[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
And mine might give you a shock[/tab]

[Verse 6]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
Cause the things you're apt to be hearin'[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A#[/ch]
Are ever so sweet and endearin'[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
You'd have to guard your heart with a key and a lock[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]F#[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
If I could walk as fast as I talk[/tab]

[Verse 7]
(Girl)
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
If you could kiss just as good as you lie[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Well I might just give you a try[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But you're just braggin' and you're tongue is a waggin'[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Like a silly flirt when he's high[/tab]

[Verse 8]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I have trouble conceivin'[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]
Of you and me up and leavin'[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
But as long as you're here you might as well buy[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
If you can kiss just as good as you lie[/tab]

[Chorus]
(Both)
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Let's keep a talkin' all night[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
We're a man and a woman, at least that's right[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And these days you can't take a chance[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
At just anything walkin' in pants[/tab]

[Instrumental]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]A#[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]A#[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]

[Verse 9]
(Both)
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
If we could film everything that we see[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A#[/ch]
We'd all be on the T.V.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
It's a little bit foolish and sort of high schoolish[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
But everyone seems to agree[/tab]

[Verse 10]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]
Though there ain't much new to be sayin'[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A#[/ch]
The game is still worth the playin'[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
We could laugh at ourselves and this whole comedy[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]F[/ch]
If we could film everything that we see[/tab]

[Outro]
(Guy)
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
But I'd still say things that would tickle you pink[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]F[/ch]
If I could talk as fast as I think[/tab]

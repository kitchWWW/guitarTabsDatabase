He drove away, I couldn't move [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
First bitter taste of what love can do [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Sat on that porch alone and cried [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]             
Told me God has someone better for me [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Dried my tears, and she just held me [/tab]

That's what angels do [/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch] 
That's what love is for[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Points you to a window [/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
When you can't find a door [/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
When you're all out of faith [/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
And it's more than you can take[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Em[/ch] 
You're not strong enough [/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Big city streets, bright city lights [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Some days the dream's not worth the fight [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Miss my hometown, wide open space [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
A clear blue sky, a slower pace [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                    
Then my phone rings and I hear his voice say [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
"Baby girl I'm proud of you, you're not alone" [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
He gives me hope, he lifts me up [/tab]

When there's no way on earth[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]

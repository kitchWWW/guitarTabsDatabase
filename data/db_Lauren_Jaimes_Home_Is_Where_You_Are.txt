Home is Where You Are
Capo 4th

[Verse]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
I don’t have china plates or a welcome mat[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
I don’t own any art to hang for guests to marvel at[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Bathroom towels are not for me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Pillows on the sofa seats[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
Have never been a thing I thought I’d need[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
So what makes a house a home?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Did you know? Did you know?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
That there’s nothing in this world I’d rather do[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Than spend my time running around with you[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
So take me home, where I belong[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
You know my home, is where you are[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
California, Texas, Tennessee[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
As long as you are next to me[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
My home is where you are[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
I own one pair of dusty cowgirl boots[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
I have a koa six string but she don’t compare to you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Mama always said to me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Ain’t no sense loving material things[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]A[/ch]
You can’t bring them to heaven when you leave[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
So what makes a house a home?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Did you know? Did you know?[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
That there’s nothing in this world I’d rather do[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]

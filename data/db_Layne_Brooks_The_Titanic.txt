[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
[ch]D[/ch]  [ch]A7[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]N.C.     [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, they built the great Titanic[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
To sail the ocean blue[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
And they thought they'd built her strong[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A7[/ch]
So no water could get through[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
But the Lord's almighty hand[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Said this ship would never land[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
It was sad when that great ship went down[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
So the people came aboard[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
To set sail from England's shore[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
The upper decks were for the rich[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A7[/ch]
Kept separate from the poor[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
And the poor were sent below[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
Where they'd be the first to go[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
It was sad when that great ship went down[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]N.C.   [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
It was sad (it was sad), it was sad (it was sad)[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]A7[/ch]
It was sad when that great ship went down[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Husbands and wives, little children lost their lives[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
It was sad when that great ship went down[/tab]


[Interlude]
[ch]D[/ch]  [ch]A7[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 3]
[tab]N.C.  [ch]D[/ch]
One o'clock on Monday morn[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
An iceberg did its worst[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And Captain Edward Smith cried out[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A7[/ch]
"Women and children first"[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
And he tried in vain to wire[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
And though every flare was fired[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
It was sad when that great ship went down[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
So they swung the lifeboats out[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
O'er the deep and frigid sea[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
And the band played on until the last[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A7[/ch]
"Nearer, My God, to Thee"[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
When the waves came o'er the side[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Fifteen hundred had to die[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
It was sad when that great ship went down[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
It was sad (it was sad), it was sad (it was sad)[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]A7[/ch]
It was sad when that great ship went down[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Husbands and wives, little children lost their lives[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
It was sad when that great ship went down[/tab]


[Outro Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
It was sad (it was sad), it was sad (it was sad)[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]A7[/ch]
How they prayed as that great ship went down[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
"Nearer, My God, to Thee", fifteen hundred lost at sea[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
It was sad when that great ship went down[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
(Nearer, My God, to Thee)[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
(It was sad when that great ship went down)[/tab]

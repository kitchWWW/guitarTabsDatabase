Verse 1:

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
It's easy to fall in love[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]        
But it's so hard to break somebody's heart[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]        
What seemed like a good idea has turned into a battlefield[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                           
Once, lust has turned to dust [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]
and all that's left's held breath, forgotten who we first met[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]        
What seemed like a good idea has turned into a battlefield[/tab]


Pre-Chorus:

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
We both know it's coming[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
Does illusion count for something we hide?[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]  
The surface tension's gotta break, one drop is all it takes to flood out this lie[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Ohhh[/tab]


Chorus:

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You and I, we have to let it each other go[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
We keep holding on but we both know[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]        
What seemed like a good idea has turned into a battlefield[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Peace will come when one of us puts down the guns[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]
Be strong for both of us. No please, don't run, don't run[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]        
Eye to eye, we face our fears unarmed on the battlefield[/tab]


[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
We seemed like a good idea[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
We seemed like a good idea [/tab]


Verse 2:

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
No blood will spill if we both get out[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Now, still it's hard to put the fire out[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]        
What seemed like a good idea has turned into a battlefield[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Feelings are shifting like the tide[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]
And I think too much about the future[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]        
What seemed like a good idea has turned into a battlefield[/tab]

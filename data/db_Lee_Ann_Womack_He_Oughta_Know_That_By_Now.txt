Lee Ann Womack - He Oughta Know That By Now


CAPO: 6th Fret



INTRO: [ch]G[/ch]


I guess he's working late again
[tab]                                         [ch]C[/ch]
I don't need to wonder where he is, but I do[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
He oughta know that by now[/tab]
  
I know his job takes a lot of him
[tab]                                            [ch]C[/ch]
There's not much left for him to give, but I need more[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch] 
He oughta know that by now[/tab]


CHORUS:
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
It's not like he's got to read my mind[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
To know what I'm feeling after all this time[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
It's just too hard to hold onto, what is never around[/tab]
N.C.      G
He oughta know that by now



He used to promise, soon things would change
[tab]                                               [ch]C[/ch]
It's been years and it's still the same and that hurts[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
He oughta know that by now[/tab]

I've grown so used to being alone
[tab]                                               [ch]C[/ch]
Couldn't be much worse if I were gone and in a way I am[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch] 
He oughta know that by now[/tab]


CHORUS:
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
It's not like he's got to read my mind[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
To know what I'm feeling after all this time[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
It's just too hard to hold onto, what is never around[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
He oughta know that by now[/tab]


INSTRUMENTAL: [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]



Heartache and coffee at the midnight motel
[tab]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
Leaving him was hard as hell, but I did[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
He oughta know that by now[/tab]

I didn't try to explain
[tab]                                          [ch]C[/ch]
No good-bye underneath my ring, that was all I left[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
He oughta know that by now[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
That was all I left[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
And he oughta know that by now[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 Don't wanna get ahead of myself[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 Feeling things I've never felt[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 It's kinda hard for me to explain[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
 Her personality and everything[/tab]

Brings me to my knees, ooh
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 She shines me up like gold on my arm[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 I wanna take it slow but it's so hard[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 I love to see her face in daylight[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]Am[/ch]
 It's more than just our bodies at night[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]D[/ch]
But she's really tempting me, ooh[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
Do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
I'm scared to death that she might be it[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
That the love is real, that the shoe might fit[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
She might just be my everything and beyond (beyond)[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]
Space and time in the afterlife[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]
Will she have my kids? Will she be my wife?[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
She might just be my everything and beyond[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 I wanna bring her 'round to meet ya[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 I think you'd like her kind demeanor[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                         [ch]Am[/ch]
 I know that Grandma would've loved her, like she was her own[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
She makes me feel at home, ooh[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
Do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
I'm scared to death that she might be it[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
That the love is real, that the shoe might fit[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
She might just be my everything and beyond (beyond)[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]
Space and time in the afterlife[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]
Will she have my kids? Will she be my wife?[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
She might just be my everything and beyond[/tab]

[Bridge]

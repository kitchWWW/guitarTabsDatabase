Artist: Les Vinyl
Song: F For Effort
Genre: 
Key: 


Les Vinyl's F for Effort - Made popular by the What Say You Podcast.

Some of the Em chords might actually be E or E7, but my ear isn't good enough to tell.  I like 
the sound of E7 when transitioning to the chorus, but you might think otherwise.

Also, try intermixing C and Cm for a more interesting sound.

I couldn't find the tabs for this song anywhere, so I
figured it out myself.  It sounds right to me, but try it for yourself.

[tab]Intro:
   [ch]A#[/ch]  [ch]A#[/ch]   [ch]G#[/ch]     [ch]D#[/ch] [ch]D#[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]
E--6---6-----4-----3--3---1-
B--6---6-----4-----4--4---1-
G--7---7-----5-----3--3---2-

Play this 4x, then:[/tab]
[ch]G#[/ch] [ch]G#[/ch] [ch]G#[/ch] [ch]G#[/ch]  [ch]D#[/ch] [ch]D#[/ch] [ch]D#[/ch] [ch]D#[/ch]

Verse progression: (repeated again and again):
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]    [ch]G#[/ch]
Which will it be?[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]          [ch]A#[/ch]
sympathy or apathy.  .  .[/tab]
 
(you get the idea.)
Chorus is just the intro chords.

Lyrics: (at the request of OLGA)
Which will it be? Sympathy or apathy? Which part of the
human condition will I believe? 
Tried then it's tested, I've just decided, I failed
is it the crowd, or the way this is going down?

When it all came down, on that saturday night, should I choose a side at 
9th at Pine?  Can we stil say, we're civilized, watched some kid go down 
at 9th at Pine.

Is being human watching all this without a sound?
Tried then it's tested, I've just decided, I failed
Is it the crowd, or the way this is going down?


Well, that didn't take long!  I hope this helps you.  E-mail me with any 
comments, suggestions, etc.  Thanks.

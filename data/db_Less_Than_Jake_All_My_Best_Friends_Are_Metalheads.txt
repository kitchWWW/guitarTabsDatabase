[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]
   You think it's strange,  that there's a way[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]B[/ch]
  of how you looked, and how you act, and how you think[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]
   pretend they're not the same as you.[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]
   You think it's strange,  that there's a way[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]B[/ch]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]
   pretend they're not the same as you.[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
  Do you know about her strength in convictions[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
  or how she puts all her faith in religion.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
  Did we take the time to really discover,[/tab]

how little we know about each other?

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]
  Keep us from saying anything.[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]
 Can't separate from everything.[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]
  And all this really means is[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
you're one in a crowd and you're paranoid of every sound.[/tab]

You're not the friend you won't miss anyhow.

You told me not to make you wait[/tab]

You're keeping me hanging on as if
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]                      [ch]Am7[/ch]

[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]
Totally lost the way you came[/tab]

Rainbow coloured day[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]
Opened out the way you changed[/tab]

And then it all starts to fade[/tab]

Tell me why you got a sad face[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I can read your mind, you don't even have to say[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
  I've been great ever since I left L.A.[/tab]

Chanel everything, I think that's why they hate
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
  Tattoos all on my face, my hands all on her waist[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
  You're no good for me, I'm so bad for you[/tab]

You're no good for me, I'm so bad for you

  Take a hit and numb the pain[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
  I'm not gonna lie to you and say that it's okay[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
  I hope I die with my chains on[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
  If you feel alone, baby, just play this song[/tab]

Wanted it, I bought it, fuck what it costed[/tab]

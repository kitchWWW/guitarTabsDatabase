[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
I saw an old friend of ours today,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Am7[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
She asked about you, I didn't quite know what to say[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Heard you been makin the rounds' round here[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]      [ch]Am7[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
While I've been trying to make tears disappear.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
Now I'm almost over you,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
I've almost shook this blues;[/tab]

So when you come back around
[tab]   [ch]A7[/ch]
After paintin' the town[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
You'll see I'm almost over you[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
You're such a sly one with your cold, cold heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]    [ch]Am7[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe leavin' came easy but it tore me apart;[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Time heals all wounds they say and I should know[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Am7[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Cause they seems like forever but I'm lettin you go[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
Now I'm almost over you,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
I've almost shook this blues;[/tab]

So when you come back around
[tab]   [ch]A7[/ch]
After paintin' the town[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
You'll see I'm almost over you[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I can forgive you as soon and i'll forget [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
All my shattered dreams;[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Although you left me with nothing to show[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]      
Only memories[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
Now I'm almost over you,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
I've almost shook this blues;[/tab]

So when you come back around
[tab]   [ch]A7[/ch]
After paintin' the town[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
You'll see I'm almost over you[/tab]

[Ending]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
When you come back around[/tab]

After paintin the town[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
You'll see I'm almost [/tab]

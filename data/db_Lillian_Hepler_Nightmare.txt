[Verse 1]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]
If I told you you broke my heart would you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]
say sorry?[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
If I told you I don’t sleep at night would[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
you care?[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
Cause all the bedbugs bite and I still cry,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
thinking about you and I[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
And how you are made for me and not her[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                             [ch]Dm[/ch]
I used to wonder when you'd wake up[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
And tell me that you made a mistake[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Cause all of these nightmares are keeping me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
awake[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]
I now know that things are better off this[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]
way[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
I’m just hoping one day when I wake up, I[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
won’t see your face[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]
Was it hard for you to say goodbye or were[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]
you ready?[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
I could tell you started distancing yourself[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Dm[/ch]
Cause when I tried to call you said leave[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]
your name and number[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
And like a book you left me waiting on a[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
shelf[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                              [ch]Dm[/ch]
I used to wonder when you’d wake up[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
And tell me that you made a mistake[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Cause all of these nightmares are keeping me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
awake[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]
I now know that things are better off this[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]
way[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
I’m just hoping one day when I wake up, I[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
won’t see your face[/tab]

(You stole my dreams and left me with a nightmare)

[Bridge]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]
I can’t say I can blame it all on you, as[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]
much as I wish to[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
Cause I saw all the signs, just as much as[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
they were red, they were black and white[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
I just didn’t want to see it[/tab]

Didn’t want to believe it
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
I didn’t want to think they were true[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
The truth is I was a fool, looking back on you[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                              [ch]Dm[/ch]
I used to wonder when you’d wake up[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
And tell me that you made a mistake[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Cause all of these nightmares are keeping me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
awake[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]
I now know that things are better off this[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]

[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
I’m just hoping one day when I wake up, I[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
won’t see your face[/tab]

[tab]                              [ch]Em[/ch]
I used to wonder when you’d wake up[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Bm[/ch]
And tell me that you made a mistake[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Cause all of these nightmares are keeping me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]

We go back home
 We don't need no more
 but just to fall in love.
 Sometimes we know all those tricks and
 We hope that they will work.

 "Show must go on" like Freddy used
 to call over twenty years ago.
 It doesn't matter that you're lost
 and you regret most of things you did before.

 and

 So what if we were wrong?
 So what if we should have just let it go?/x2

 Your prophets are dead
 you don't believe what they've said
 no more.
 You just want to move on
 but no one tells you where to go

 bridge :

 Take your time.
 Don't raise your voice.
 I know it's hard
 but you just have to make this choice /x4

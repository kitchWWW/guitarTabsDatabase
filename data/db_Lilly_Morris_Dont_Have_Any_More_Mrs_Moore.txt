[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Mrs Moore, who lives next door,is such a dear old soul,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Of children she has a score or more,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
her husband on the dole![/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
I don't know how she manages to keep that lot, I'm sure,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                                              [ch]G[/ch]
I said to her today as she was standing at the door;[/tab]


[Chorus 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
"Don't have any more Mrs Moore,[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]F[/ch]
Mrs Moore, please don't have any more![/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]    
The more you have the more you'll want, they say,[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
Enough is as good as a feast any day![/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
If you have any more, Mrs Moore,[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
You'll have to rent the house next door![/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
For the more you have of kids,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Then the less you’ll have of quids,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
Don't have any more Mrs Moore!"[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
The little inn she uses now is called The Wooden Hut,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                       [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
She's first one in at opening time, and last out when they shut![/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                                          [ch]F[/ch]
And when she's had a quite few she can’t go very far[/tab]
[tab]                                              [ch]G[/ch]
And this is what they shout to her across the bar;[/tab]


[Chorus 2]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
"Don't have any more Mrs Moore,[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]F[/ch]
Mrs Moore, please don't have any more![/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
The more you have the more you'll want, they say,[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Enough is as good as a feast any day![/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
If you have any more, Mrs Moore,[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
You'll never reach your front door![/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
For too many double gins[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Give the ladies double chins![/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
Don't have any more Mrs Moore!"[/tab]


[Verse 3]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
She's had a lot of husbands who in love with her have fell,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
This one is the seventh one, and he don’t look too well![/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                [ch]F[/ch]
A year ago she married him, and on their wedding day,[/tab]
[tab]                                                         [ch]G[/ch]
As they were walking down the aisle, I heard the parson say;[/tab]


[Chorus 3]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
"Don't have any more Mrs Moore,[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]F[/ch]
Mrs Moore, please don't have any more![/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
The more you have the more you'll want, they say,[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Enough is as good as a feast any day![/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
If you have any more, Mrs Moore,[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
I don't know what we'll do, I'm sure![/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Our graveyard is so small,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
There'll be no room for them all![/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
Don't have any more Mrs Moore!"[/tab]

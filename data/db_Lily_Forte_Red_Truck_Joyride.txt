[Intro]
A  x4


[Verse 1]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
Met the love of my life in Brooklyn[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Asus2[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
He told me I was a damaged woman[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
The way we met, wasn’t quite yet[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
Love at first sight[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
I spoke of him the first night I met him[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Asus2[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
My friends, they just really didn’t get it[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
They couldn’t see what he meant to me[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Asus2[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
So I never discussed it with them[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Where’d you go my love?[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
Did you leave me because we were young?[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]Asus2[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Do I ever cross your mind or was I meant to just pass the time?[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
We had some good times together[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Asus2[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
But for now well just speak of the weather[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                                        [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]Asus2[/ch]
You held my hand, you were the perfect man for me[/tab]

When I say your name, I say it softly
[tab]       [ch]Asus2[/ch]
If I said it too loud, it might haunt me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
I line my lips, awaiting the perfect kiss[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Asus2[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
‘Cause I ain’t got yours no more[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Where’d you go my love?[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
Did you leave me because we were young?[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]Asus2[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Do I ever cross your mind or was I meant to just pass the time?[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
I bank on what you last told me[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Asus2[/ch]
But you never come through for me[/tab]

Why would you?
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
I mean it was nothing but a fling for you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I remember you by that red truck joy ride[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
In a pink dress that wasn’t mine[/tab]

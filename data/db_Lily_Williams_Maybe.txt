[ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
[ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]Gm[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
February started[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Gm[/ch]
Frosty screens departed[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]Fm[/ch]               [ch]Eb[/ch]
I lost my heart and found a way to go[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
Knocking on my window[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Gm[/ch]
Late nights on your pillow[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bb[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]Fm[/ch]                  [ch]Eb[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
As winter turned to spring my heart had found a home, in your own[/tab]


[Pre-chorus]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]Gm[/ch]
And places we'd go[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
Became our own[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                       [ch]Bb[/ch]
But maybe we were driving in the dark before we knew the way[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]Bb[/ch]                       [ch]Bb7[/ch]
And maybe we tried a little hard to cover up our own mistakes[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]Bb7[/ch]
And maybe it was simply too much love and too much pain[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Eb[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
But I know springtime will come again[/tab]


[ch]Bb7[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch]


[Verse 2]
[tab]   [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]Bbmaj7[/ch]
We fell into love quickly[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb7[/ch]             [ch]Gm[/ch]
And it just felt so easy[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]Eb[/ch]
Like I was made to like and laugh and love you more[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Bb[/ch]
And I thought that we would last forever[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bb7[/ch]          [ch]Gm7[/ch]
In this lazy summer weather[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Fm[/ch]                            [ch]Eb[/ch]
In salty air with sun bleached hair I told you that I'd be yours[/tab]


[Pre-chorus]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]Gm[/ch]
From shore to shore[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]      [ch]Eb[/ch]
Forevermore[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
But maybe we were driving in the dark before we knew the way[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]                     [ch]Bb7[/ch]
And maybe we tried a little hard to cover up our own mistakes[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]Bb7[/ch]
And maybe it was simply too much love and too much pain[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Eb[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
But I know springtime will come again[/tab]


[ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch]


[Bridge]
[tab]                                  [ch]F[/ch]
We both said stuff we didn't mean[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]
We were only 18[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
And as fall came[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]
You were looking for someone to blame[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Eb[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Bb[/ch]
But it was change and strains of life and lust[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
And twists and turns and tears and trust[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]Gm[/ch]   [ch]Bb[/ch]
And maybe this was meant to be[/tab]


[ch]Eb[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
Winter came in thickly[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Fb7[/ch]                [ch]Gm[/ch]
And frost drove up my windscreen[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Fm[/ch]
I think about you now and then[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb[/ch]
Of what we had, what could've been[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]
But our favourite singer told us[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Eb[/ch]        [ch]Ebm[/ch]
Future flowers from all this rain[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Eb[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]Bb[/ch]   [ch]Bb7[/ch]
So I know springtime will come again[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
And you know springtime will come again[/tab]

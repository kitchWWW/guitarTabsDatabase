[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
We got an apartment[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
On Center Avenue[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
With whitewashed walls and wooden floors[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
It's custom built for two[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]Abdim7[/ch]
And we might not have a table or a bed frame[/tab]

We'll make do
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, no one's ever been as rich as me and you[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
We drink sparkling water[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
As if it were champagne[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And toast ourselves to all our wealth[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
Like "here's to happy days"[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#/A#[/ch]   [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
Oh, our credit card's in debt[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Abdim7[/ch]
Because the rent here is insane[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
But there's nothing that I would trade for me and you[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]Em(b5)[/ch]
   I'm not trying to deny[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Bm[/ch]
All the things money can buy[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Cdim7[/ch]
Wouldn't it be nice[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]Em(b5)[/ch]
   But we've got time enough to spend[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]Bm[/ch]
Yeah, we still got our whole lives yet[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D/A[/ch]            [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
So maybe down the line[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
We'll be so much older[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
Buying fancy shoes[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
And catching cabs with shopping bags down Melrose Avenue[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#/A#[/ch]     [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
And we'll toast ourselves to all our wealth[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Abdim7[/ch]
Like "look how much we grew"[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, no one's ever been as rich as me and you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, no one's ever been as rich as me and you[/tab]

At the end of every joke, the audience falls for the punchline...[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am7[/ch]                    [ch]D7[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
At the end of every day, the sun falls into the night sky[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]                      [ch]D7[/ch]
Spring fell into summer, the months into each other[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]
As May fell into June[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]                    [ch]D7[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]

Father sings a lullaby as the boy falls asleep (Hmm)[/tab]

It's funny how the city lights make you fall for a dream (Hmm)[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]                      [ch]D7[/ch]
Friends fall into lovers, right into one another[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Still they don't have a clue[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]                    [ch]D7[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]
'Cause none fell as hard as I did for you[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]Cm7[/ch]      [ch]F#m[/ch]      [ch]Bm[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]
It happened quickly, I wasn't thinking[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am7[/ch]               [ch]A7[/ch]           [ch]D7[/ch]
Suddеnly you, you were the only thing I saw[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cm7[/ch]  [ch]F#m[/ch]           [ch]Bm[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]
Kinda likе gravity, I fought it so madly[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]                 [ch]D7[/ch]                      [ch]Gm7[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
I guess that's what happens to things that fall...[/tab]


[tab][Post-Chorus]
[ch]Am7[/ch]  [ch]D7[/ch] [ch]Gm7[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
Ah-ah, ah[/tab]
[ch]Am7[/ch]  [ch]D7[/ch] [ch]Gm7[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]


[Verse 3]
[tab] [ch]Am7[/ch]                           [ch]D7[/ch]               [ch]Gm7[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]
Best friends moving out of the city fall out of touch..[/tab]

And her eyes were still just as pretty but he fell out of love....[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am7[/ch]                     [ch]D7[/ch]
If you break my heart then we'll fall apart[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Gm7[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
And it all ends too soon[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am7[/ch]             [ch]D7[/ch]             [ch]Gm7[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
Still none fell as hard as I did for you...[/tab]

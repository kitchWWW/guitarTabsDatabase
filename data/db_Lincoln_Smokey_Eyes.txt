       [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]

smokey eyes are you feeling good for now you’re here with me

                 [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]

seems like we’ve waited long enough for someone else to make us feel complete

     [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]

it’s not a bitter flavor and it’s not a sweeter drink

              [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]Fm[/ch]

i’m scared to ask you if you would do the same for me

       [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]

smokey eyes— that’s your name isn’t it at least that’s what i call you

       [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]

when i call you do you shake the way i shake when i call to say i’m through

        [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]

“no i shake the way you do at shows so people know you’re cool

 [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]Fm[/ch]

violently but still controlled enough to screw ”



            [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]

so help me make amends with all my friends

       [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Am7[/ch]

most other people are just dead ends

          [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Fm[/ch]

there’s nothing worse than making friends



        [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]

sticky thighs are you wild now or just a memory

     [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]

some people want to be your friend

      [ch]C[/ch]

some people just want to be free

       [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]

and the worst thing about me

             [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]

is that i’m somewhere in between

         [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]Fm[/ch]

i might miss you but i’m still trying to get clean



            [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]

so help me make amends with all my friends

       [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Am7[/ch]

most other people are just dead ends

          [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Fm[/ch]

there’s nothing worse than making friends



       [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]

you’ve had enough to drink

                [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Am7[/ch]

you know you’re drowning in the flavor of

      [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]Fm[/ch]

cough syrup and vicodin

       [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]

you’ve got the bitter flavor down so

[ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Am7[/ch]

dab the sweeter drink on a napkin then

[ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]Fm[/ch]

hold it up to your mouth so you can sleep



      [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]

quiet lies that you’re telling to

      [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]

those black and screaming skies

              [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]

i hope you’re walking around campus

       [ch]C[/ch]

contemplating your own smallish size

        [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]

this is not what all my idols told me college would be like

            [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]Fm[/ch]

i hope someday you learn to take your own advice



            [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]

so help me make amends with all my friends

       [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Am7[/ch]

most other people are just dead ends

          [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Fm[/ch]

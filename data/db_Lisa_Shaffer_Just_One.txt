[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Crowd gathered 'round a school bus [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
3rd Street and Elm [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
The neighbor man said, "Officer [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I caught it all on film" [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I watched my little grandson [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Come so close to death [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
By that man standin' right there [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
With liquor on his breath [/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Another little boy wasn't so lucky [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He was lyin' there in the street [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
His little lifeless body [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Beneath the yellow sheet [/tab]
[tab]	 [ch]C[/ch]
While the young man was on the sidewalk [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Goin' through a sobriety check [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
The crowd was turnin into a lynch mob [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
When he raised up his hands and said[/tab]


[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I only had just one [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I swear that's the truth [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
That kid came outta nowhere [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]			  [ch]D[/ch]
There was nothing I could do [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]		  [ch]G[/ch]
I couldn't swerve I couldn't stop [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]		[ch]G[/ch]
Now here I am asking God[/tab]
[tab]	   [ch]Am[/ch]
What have I done? [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]	      [ch]G[/ch]		[ch]C[/ch]
I only had just one [/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
A young momma burst through the crowd [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And pulled back that yellow sheet [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]			      [ch]G[/ch]
Collapsed and started shakin' uncontrollably [/tab]
[tab]	 [ch]C[/ch]
Searched until she found that young man [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
With her shattered eyes [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Then tore a hole into his soul[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
As she screamed and cried[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I only had just one[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And you took him away [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I hope this is something [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]		[ch]D[/ch]
You relive everyday [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]		      [ch]G[/ch]
You coulda swerved and you coulda stopped [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]		   [ch]G[/ch]
But you didn't now look my God[/tab]
[tab]	   [ch]Am[/ch]		[ch]D[/ch]
What have you done? [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]	   [ch]G[/ch]		[ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
I only had just one [/tab]
[tab]			[ch]G[/ch]
I only had just one[/tab]

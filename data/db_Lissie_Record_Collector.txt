Intro [ch]Bbm[/ch]

[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]
I'm tired of saying[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Ab[/ch]
That I won't get lost ever again[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Gb[/ch]         [ch]Bbm[/ch]
Who knows, maybe I will[/tab]

And everywhere I go

There I'll be
[tab]       [ch]Ab[/ch]
With a rusty old rake in a pile of leaves[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Gb[/ch]              [ch]Bbm[/ch]
Oh my, truly daunting[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Gb[/ch]
But my blue eyes[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bbm[/ch]
Cannot see[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Gb[/ch]                    [ch]Bbm[/ch]
That their real hue is probably green[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Gb[/ch]               [ch]Ab[/ch]
I should keep records of these things[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Gb[/ch]        [ch]Ab[/ch]         [ch]Bbm[/ch]
And I'll know what yesterdays bring[/tab]


I'm, I'm not really sure
[tab]        [ch]Ab[/ch]                         
But I'm starting to think that I've been here before[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Gb[/ch]
Who knows[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bbm[/ch]
Maybe I have[/tab]

And everywhere I went
[tab]                   [ch]Ab[/ch]
There I was with a choir of bees[/tab]

They were all a buzz
[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]         [ch]Bbm[/ch]
Oh my, how amusing[/tab]


But my blue eyes
Cannot see
That their real hue is probably green
I should keep records of these things
And I'll know what yesterdays bring


But...
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]                      [ch]Ab[/ch]
One time, there was this one time[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Gb[/ch]                [ch]Bbm[/ch]
When I swore God, she spoke to me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bbm[/ch]                 [ch]Ab[/ch]
And she told me, oh yes she told me[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Gb[/ch]                   [ch]Bbm[/ch]
Of all the wonder that she could bring[/tab]

And I said,
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch],                          [ch]Ab[/ch]                            [ch]Gb[/ch]            
Won't you, won't you fill me up with it, won't you fill me up with it,[/tab]

Won't you fill me
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]                          [ch]Ab[/ch]                                [ch]Gb[/ch]
Won't you, won't you fill me up with it, why don't you fill me up with it,[/tab]

Why don't you fill me
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]                          [ch]Ab[/ch]                               [ch]Gb[/ch]
Won't you, won't you fill me up with it, why do't you fill me up with it,[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Bbm[/ch] [ch]Ab[/ch] [ch]Gb[/ch] [ch]Bbm[/ch]
Why don't you fill me[/tab]


But my blue eyes
Cannot see
That their real hue is probably green
I should keep records of these things
And I'll know what yesterdays bring
I am always here with me
And I'll know what yesterdays bring

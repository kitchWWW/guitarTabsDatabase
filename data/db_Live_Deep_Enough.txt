we hit a couch, the place was packed with sweaty palms,
sweaty thongs, and sweaty backs my mouth was dry,
my brain cold high, the groove was right,
so i decided to ignite your eyes met mine,
you skirt began to rise,
and so did i now you know that i took that prize in the middle of the club,
in the middle of the club, in the middle of club now tell me!

does he run it deep enough
to take you there?
does he run it deep enough
oh tell me baby
does he run it deep enough?
tell me baby

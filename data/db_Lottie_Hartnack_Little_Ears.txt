Song: Little Ears
Genre: 
Key: A


[Verse]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Little ears hide behind closed doors so you don't know they're there[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Little ears sneak out of bed and hide in shadows at the top of the stairs[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Little ears rarely do get seen but they'd hear more than you'd know[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Little ears hide their tears as they hug you and skip off down the road[/tab]


[PreChorus]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And when you're with your friends you don't want them to hear[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Cos you don't know they saw you last night when you were in tears[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Little ears hold the weight of the world with the secrets they won't say[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Cos little ears love you more than you know and they won't let you get taken away[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F#m[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]
You'll stay strong for them and you're not to blame[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
That little ears will come when you're in pain[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Little ears would never let you see[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]F#m[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
They're stronger than they should be[/tab]
[ch]F#m[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Little ears growing up tryna prove they're not little anymore[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Little ears have a new family now that you walked out the door[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
But little ears search for love in wrong places; you could never give it to them[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
So little ears follow down your path with the wrong friends and wrong men[/tab]


[PreChorus]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
And then they'll have a child too young with nowhere to go[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
But they'll hide their fears so new little ears would never know[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
Little ears hold the weight of the world with the secrets they won't say[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
Cos little ears love you more than you know and they won't let you get taken away[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F#m[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]
They'll stay strong for you and they're not to blame[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
That sometimes they can't hide all their pain[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Little ears would never let you see[/tab]

They're struggling more than they should be


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]*           [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
  And it's hard when all you hear is the world thinks you'll fail[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
  When they write your life as another kid gone off of the rails[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F#m[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
But little ears are stronger than you ever thought[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
And they'll prove you wrong in this, I know[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
Cos little ears have something to fight for[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
And they have little ears of their own[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                                                           [ch]D[/ch]
Little ears hold the weight of the world; there's still things they cannot say[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]E[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
But little ears love you more than you know and you will never get taken away[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                                                    [ch]D[/ch]
Cos you gave them strength, chased away their pain, and they know that they'll never fall again[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Little ears have grown up and you can see[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
They're happy like they should be[/tab]

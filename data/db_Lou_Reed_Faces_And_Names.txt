I'm always staring at someone who hurts[/tab]

[tab]       | [ch]G[/ch]               | [ch]C7[/ch]
And the one they hurt is me[/tab]

Faces and names, to me they're all the same
If I looked like you and you looked like me
There'd be less trouble you see
Faces and names I wish they'd go away
I'd disappear into that wall and never talk
Faces and names
I wish I was a robot or a machine
Without a feeling or a thought
People who want to meet the name I have
Are always disappointed when they meet me
Faces and names, I wish they were the same
Faces and names only cause problems for me
Faces and names
I'd rather be a hole in the wall - looking out on the other side
I'd rather look and listen, listen and not talk
To faces and names
I had a breakdown when I was a kid
I lost my hair when I was young
If you dress older when you're not, as your really age you look the same
If we all looked the same, we wouldn't play these games
Me dressing for you and you dressing for me - undressing for me
Faces and names if they all were the same
You wouldn't be jealous of me o me jealous of you
Me jealous of you - I'm jealous of you

Your face and your name[/tab]
Your face and your name

You might think I'm frivolous, uncaring and cold
You might think I'm frivolous - depends on your point of view
Society And who paints and records them - the high and the low
I left my all life behind me and never went back

Forever changed, forever changed

Got to get to the city - get a job
Got to get some work to see me through
My old life's disappearing from view
Hong Kong - and I was changed
Burma and India - and I was changed
Only art to see me through
Only heart to see me through
My old life disappearing from my view
Brigid and Pat - please see me through
The whole thing quickly receding
My life disappearing - disappearing from view

Forever changed, forever changed

I left my old life behind and was forever changed
Forever changed

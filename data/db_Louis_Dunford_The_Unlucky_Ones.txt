[Intro] (Fading In)

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
Daniel was a D.J in the squat raves down in Brixton,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
loved old school garage anthems and had mastered how to mix them.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
But Daniel took a pill one night and floated up to heaven,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]***
now, we call him Rocket Man, he's high 24/7.[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
We should have seen it coming when his set was growing old,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]**               [ch]D[/ch]**
he lost his passion for the classics as the session took it's hold.[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
A moments resurrection seems a heavy price to pay,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]**           [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]*
he sold his whole record collection just to sniff it all away.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]**
But it's just another day in the life of the unlucky ones[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]**             [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
dreaming of the days when getting high was just for fun.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
Saying this will one the last line then I'm done,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]*               ([ch]Am[/ch])
but the last line never comes   for the unlucky ones.[/tab]

[Interlude]
| [ch]Am[/ch]          | [ch]C[/ch]           | [ch]G[/ch]           | [ch]D[/ch]***        |

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
Tommy did the knowledge double, lively like his Daddy,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
knew the history of every street, was born to be a cabby.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
But Tommy was a gambler, spent his weekly wage in hours,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]***
chasing thrills in William Hills and the local Paddy Powers.[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
We should have seen it coming when we were seventeen,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]**            [ch]D[/ch]**
he'd win a one-er on the races, stick it the fruit machine.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
So, when the sun is up he's out a luck, not a penny to his name.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]**          [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]*
So, he's back out with his light on just to fund another game.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]**
But it's just another day in the life of the unlucky ones[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]**             [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
dreaming of the days when getting high was just for fun.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
Saying this will one the last line then I'm done,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]                ([ch]Am[/ch])
but the last line never comes   for the unlucky ones.[/tab]

[Interlude]
| [ch]Am[/ch]          | [ch]C[/ch]           | [ch]G[/ch]           | [ch]D[/ch]           |
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  "God, Grant me the serenity[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
  to accept the things I cannot change,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
  the courage to change the things I can[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]D[/ch]
and the wisdom to know the difference".[/tab]

[Verse 3] (I do play this in RINGS)
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]*                     [ch]C[/ch]*
Sammy was dealer to the bankers in the city,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]*                            [ch]D[/ch]*
she funded her own habit with the profit from the kitty.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]*                       [ch]C[/ch]*
But Sammy is a sponsor in the meetings, now she's sober,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]*                                 [ch]D[/ch]*
addicted to the twelve steps now her dealing days are over.[/tab]

[End-Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
She said I saw it coming when I was getting ill,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]**            [ch]D[/ch]**
I was destined for the grave or a ten stretch in the ville.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                                       [ch]C[/ch]
But now three years on she's going strong with a baby on the way,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]**       [ch]D[/ch]*
she's still battling her demons, they'll never go away.[/tab]

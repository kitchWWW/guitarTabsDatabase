[Intro]

[ch]E[/ch]   

*Whistle* 
 
[Verse 1]

[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]  
Sometimes I sit and reminisce, about the good old days I miss [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]B[/ch] 
about the days I spent with all my friends[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]  
In fact, I’ve come to realise, those were the best days of our lives,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch] 
Oh what I’d give to be 14 once again[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
But still nostalgia makes me sick, I feel I’ve grown up far too quick [/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]B[/ch] 
But I can’t help thinking about back in the days[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]
When we were the riff we were the raff, my Pals would wait outside my gaff[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]B[/ch] 
The door would open and you’d hear my old girl say[/tab]

X X X X

[Verse 2]

[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
Oh no he can’t come out to Play tonight, he’s lucky he ain't dead the shite[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]B[/ch] 
He stole another tenner out of my purse[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
And so all you boys can piss off home, don’t bell him on his dog & bone[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]B[/ch] 
I swear to god you fuckers make him worse.[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]

[tab]                   [ch]C#m[/ch] 
But little did she know[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]B[/ch]                                         
That when she's tucked up oh so tight, [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
we'd roam the streets till it was light[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]B[/ch]
Run from old bill all through the night, [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#m[/ch]
Until the day[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]B[/ch]     
We were Delinquents little shits[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
we were the hoodrats taking sips[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]
Out of the bottle, [/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]C#m[/ch]
while we sit on your estate[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch] 
And life was so simple then, [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]
when we were hooligans. [/tab]

[ch]E[/ch]

[Verse]

[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
So off we’d roam into night, we'd ride our stolen pedal bikes[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]B[/ch] 
And who’s to say where we would go or who we’d see[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
But still a plan that never fails, get on the booze and off the rails [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]B[/ch] 
We’d Buy a 20 bag of snout with fake ID, [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
And all our clobber was on form, we’d wear the sweet mate uniform[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]B[/ch] 
Grey tracksuit bottoms, Ralph Lauren we're looking suave[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
And all the birds are throwing up, cheap chardonnay in plastic cups[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]B[/ch]  N.C.
Dressed like it’s prom night but they're pissing in a park [/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]

[tab]                  [ch]C#m[/ch]
And it’s only 8 O’clock[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]B[/ch]
But who’s to say romance is dead, [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
She’s in the bushes off her head[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]B[/ch]
With an older boy who stole a ped [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C#m[/ch]
that she adores[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]B[/ch]
But old prince charming’s just a drip, [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
The smell of stella on his lips[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]B[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch] 
Her make up’s run, Her tights are ripped, [/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
her knees are sore[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch] 
And girls were so foolish then[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]  
When we were a hooligans.[/tab]

[ch]E[/ch]

[Verse]

[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]
So as the night would carry on, the joints were rolled the birds were gone[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]B[/ch] 
As all the boys sat on the benches getting stoned[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]
And as we got high into the night, you’d hear the sirens, see the lights [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]B[/ch] 
Oh it’s the scum, here they come to take us home[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]
So, with a meaty on the way, we’d throw the booze and green away[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]B[/ch] 
We’d jump the fence, lodge out the park, onto the street[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]                                   [ch]E[/ch]
Oh hurry up boys fuckin hell, I can’t spend the night locked in cell[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]B[/ch] 
Cause my old man and my old girl think I’m asleep[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]
But what a way to end the night, chased through the streets by flashing lights[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]B[/ch] 
if you can’t have it on your toes your getting chored[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]
And as the night came to an end, we'd lost the old ball once again[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                                      [ch]B[/ch] 
before my mum was up, I’d slip through the front door[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]

[tab]                     [ch]C#m[/ch] 
Oh my how times have changed [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]B[/ch]
So as I sit and reminisce [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
about those good old days I miss[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]B[/ch]
So much has changed, sometimes I wish[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]
I’d not grown old[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]B[/ch]
They'd call us hoodrats, call us scum, [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
I’d call us kids just having fun[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]B[/ch]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
We were delinquents who would call [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]
these streets our own.[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]
And we believed things would be that way forever then[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
When we hooligans[/tab]

[Outro]

*Whistle* 

[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
When we hooligans[/tab]

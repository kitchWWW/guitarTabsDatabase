[tab][ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
Once I was a lady, dressed in black and blue[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
Used to walk the boulevard, cause that's what ladies do[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
My nails were always polished, my secrets always hid[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                       [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch] 
I just did whatever it was that all the other ladies did[/tab]

at nighttime around my bedside I keep a million lights
one for every soldier who fought the war and died
for my husband is a landlord whose eyes are full of greed
and his army full of young men whom he never even sees


[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]								    [ch]D[/ch]			
But now I am somebody else with golden books upon my shelves and diamonds[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
on my mind[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Strolling through the woods at night to find the little bits of light[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]		[ch]E[/ch]
others leave behind[/tab]


[tab][ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
Once I was a soldier in the army of some lord[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                      [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]
I have never even seen him, I just got paid to hold his sword[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]			[ch]A[/ch]
I kept my armour shiny and I kept my secrets hid[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
and whatever I was told to do, that is what I did[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
when I think about it now it's hard for me to say[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]
whether I had a choice in life to do the things my way[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
because by the time I heard about that lady's bedside state[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                      [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
I had already gone far too far, it was already too late [/tab]



[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]								    [ch]D[/ch]			
But now I am somebody else with golden books upon my shelves and diamonds[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
on my mind[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Strolling through the woods at night to find the little bits of light[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]		[ch]E[/ch]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Once I was a student, I had to pick up my degree[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]B[/ch]
And I thought about the years gone by, the years that numbered [/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
three[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
How things that had seemed important turned out to be a joke[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
And things that had seemed natural had all gone up in smoke[/tab]


Earlier a crowd had come to see me win my prize
I felt like I deserved it, it was justice in my eyes
but the only thing that I could think was 'what am I gonna do?
when all of this is over, when my days of hope are through?'

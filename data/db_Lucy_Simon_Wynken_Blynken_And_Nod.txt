Subject: Wynken Blynken and Nod

Here is the complete and corrected version of this song.
Lucy Simon composed the music to Eugene Field's poem.  You can hear The
Dobboe Brothers' version of it on the album "In Harmony."  If you can find
the record "The Simon Sisters Sing for Children" you can hear Lucy sing it
herself.
She plays it with the capo on the 3rd fret.


(Em)Wynken and Blynken and (A)Nod one night
[tab]Sailed ([ch]Gm[/ch])off in [ch]C[/ch] wooden ([ch]C[/ch])shoe
(D)Sailed in a river of crystal light (E)into a sea of (A)dew[/tab]

(Em)Now where are you going and what do you (A)wish
The old (Em)moon asked of the (A)three
Well, we're (D)going out fishing for (Bm)herring fish that live in the
beautiful ([ch]C[/ch])sea

Nets of (G)Silver and (C)Gold have we said (E)Wynken and Blynken and(A)Nod

The old moon laughed andsang a song
As they rocked in their wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long ruffled the waves of dew

Well the little stars were the herring fish that lived in the beautiful sea
Now cast your nets wherever you wish never afeared are we
So sang the stars to the fisherman three:  Wynken and Blynken and Nod

All night long their nets they threw to the stars and the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe bringing the fisherman home

Twas all so pretty a sight it seemed as if it could not be
And some folks thought it was a dream they dreamed
Of sailingthe beautiful sea
But I shall name you the fisherman three:  Wynken, Blynken and Nod

Now Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes and Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the sky is a wee one's trundle bed
So close your eyes while mother sings of the beautiful sights that be
And you will see wonderful things as you rock on the misty sea
where the old moon rocks the fisherman three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

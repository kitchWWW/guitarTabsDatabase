This song is based in the key of F natural minor, and could move into the natural major 
of Ab major..but it sounds consistantly minor throughout..


The melody and chords that are missing will be part of the key signature..


~~~~ Ab Major has 4 flats in its key.. these are Bb, Eb, Ab, Db.. ~~~~

so the scale of Fm is : -


1 2 3  4  5 6  7  8va

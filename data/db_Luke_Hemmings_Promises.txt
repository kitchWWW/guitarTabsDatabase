[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
 We fell in love in the city[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
 I'd never seen it this cold[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
 She said, "I hate how you're living"[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
 Then pushed me against the wall[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
No, I don't want to leave[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
It's a damn cold night[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
And I don't want to sleep[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
Oh, just tell me it's too late to drive[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
Can I stay here tonight?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
Can I stay here tonight?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Can I stay here tonight with you?[/tab]


[Post-Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
Stay here (I've made too many promises)[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Stay here (Don't make too many promises)[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Stay here (You make it hard to be alone)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Here[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
 I wasn't always a cynic[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
 It's just I've been bought and sold[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
  But you saw the beauty inside it[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
 At twenty-seven years old[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
No, I don't want to leave[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
It's a damn cold night[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
And I don't want to sleep[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
Oh, just tell me it's too late to drive[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
Can I stay here tonight?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
Can I stay here tonight?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Can I stay here tonight with you?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
Can I (Can I) stay here tonight?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
Can I (Can I) stay here tonight?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Can I stay here tonight with you?[/tab]


[Post-Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
Stay here (I've made too many promises)[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Stay here (Don't make too many promises)[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Stay here (You make it hard to be alone)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
Here[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
It's the promises[/tab]

We break 'em every time
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
And every consequence[/tab]

We kiss between the lines
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
And do it all again[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
I guess I just feel better around you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
It's the promises[/tab]

We make 'em every time
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
And every word that you said[/tab]

I hang on every line
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
I do it all again[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
I guess I just feel better around you[/tab]

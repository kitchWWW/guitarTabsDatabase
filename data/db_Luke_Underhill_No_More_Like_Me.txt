Verse 1: 

[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
Does it hurt? Does it hurt when you hear my name?[/tab]

[tab]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
Does it feel like you’re the one to blame?[/tab]

[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Am I the one to blame?[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Are you scared? Are you scared that you’ll never get by?[/tab]

[tab]                          [ch]F#m[/ch]
Is it a problem that you haven’t cried?[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Why am I yet to cry?[/tab]


Pre-Chorus:

[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
So can’t you see? You had a hold on me[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]F#m[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
And now there’s three. Why do you do this to me?[/tab]


Chorus:

[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]
I know I didn’t have much, but I thought I was enough[/tab]

[tab]                  [ch]F#m[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]    
I would’ve done anything; I even bought you a ring[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
I gave you my all; I’d catch you when you would fall[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]F#m[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]     
So now I hope you see, there are no more like me [/tab]

[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]    
Do you ache? Do you ache when you hear my voice?[/tab]

[tab]                       [ch]F#m[/ch]
Does it feel like you have no choice?[/tab]

I had no choice[/tab]

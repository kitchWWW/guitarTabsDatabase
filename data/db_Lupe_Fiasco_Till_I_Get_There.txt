All of the chords in "Till I Get There" are just Db chords with different bass notes.
It's easier to play these chords on the piano, but can be played on the guitar through
power chords.
If you play it on the piano, though, your right hand would be holding down the same bass
note as the chord, but down an octave. So for the Db/C chord, for example, you would have
the chord with your right hand and with your left hand you would be holding down a C for 
the entire bar.

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
Album on hold, whole world on hold[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Db/C[/ch]
The crowd is like, hold, operator's like "hold"[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db/B[/ch]
     Man, now ain't that cold[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
I'm just trying to talk to my homie, that's up in the hole[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Db[/ch]                                              [ch]Db/C[/ch]
Now homegirl not tryin' to be a ho, even though she on a pole[/tab]

Can she get a second chance? No
[tab][ch]Db/B[/ch]
     Whoa, like the opposite of go[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
That ain't how it's supposed to be: a butterfly[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Db[/ch]
But for the sake of rhyming let’s just say "butterflyee"[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db/C[/ch]
     The truth stings like Muhammad Ali[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db/B[/ch]
     I tell 'em tell 'em don't homocide me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
I'm just a little old hope with his back against the ropes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
Fightin' for his fans and, fightin' for his folks[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Db/C[/ch]
But the boo's from the crowd can become so loud[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Db/B[/ch]
If I could block 'em out then, I could knock 'em out and[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
Dance around the ring, but until then I'll sing[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]Db[/ch]
I'mma keep it cool, and I'mma do me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Db/C[/ch]
It is what it is and that's how it's gon' be[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Db/B[/ch]
Until I get there[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
Until I get there[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Db[/ch]
Yeah I got flaws, I know I’m not perfect[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Db/C[/ch]
But all ups and downs, will soon be worth it[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Db/B[/ch]
When I get there[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
When I get there, woah-oh, oh[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]                                               [ch]Db/C[/ch]
"Doctor doctor please! The fame ain't painless enough"[/tab]

That's cause you ain't famous enough
[tab]    [ch]Db/B[/ch]                                             [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]  
You got a little game, but your name ain't ringing enough[/tab]
[tab]                                               [ch]Db[/ch]
He said, "Take 2 of these and put change in my cup."[/tab]

I said I wasn't poor, he gave me some more
[tab]    [ch]Db/C[/ch]
Prescribed me publicist and pointed to the door[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db/B[/ch]              [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
"Out!" Ouch.. I’m telling you this all from a therapist's couch[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
Tell me about your mother, what she's all about[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Db/C[/ch]
Prescribed me a interview and then told me to bounce[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db/B[/ch]
     Damn...geez...[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]      
The world is so cold, I'm glad I bought these skiis[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Db[/ch]
Went right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db/C[/ch]
Rendered unconscious, they rushed me to a concert[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Db/B[/ch]
Instead of green jello, they made me chicken soup[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
They fed me magazine covers and video shoots[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]Db[/ch]
I'mma keep it cool, and I'mma do me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Db/C[/ch]
It is what it is and that's how it's gon' be[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Db/B[/ch]
Until I get there[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
Until I get there[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Db[/ch]
Yeah, I got flaws, I know I’m not perfect[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Db/C[/ch]
But all ups and downs, will soon be worth it[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Db/B[/ch]
When I get there[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
When I get there, woah-oh, oh[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]     [ch]Db[/ch]
And when I finally make it, I'mma stunt so hard[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db/C[/ch]
Evel as Knievel, I'mma jump so far[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db/B[/ch]
Way up in the atmosphere, I ain't comin' back[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
Be a jerk to these jerks, yeah that'll make 'em hurt[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
Huh? Said the young boy in the mirror[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db/C[/ch]
A young version of me, so I started to tear up[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Db/B[/ch]
He said, you need to cheer up, your mind need to clear up[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
You're already here, just be yourself from here up"[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
Then he disappeared and I felt something familiar[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db/C[/ch]
Somethin' I was taught, somethin' I had lost[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db/B[/ch]
If you are afraid, the fear that you gon' change some[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
All you gotta do is just remember where you came from.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]Db[/ch]
I'mma keep it cool, and I'mma do me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Db/C[/ch]
It is what it is and that's how it's gon' be[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Db/B[/ch]
Until I get there[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
Until I get there[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Db[/ch]
Yeah, I got flaws, I know I’m not perfect[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Db/C[/ch]
But all ups and downs, will soon be worth it[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Db/B[/ch]
When I get there[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Db/Bb[/ch]
When I get there, woah-oh, oh[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
We have walked in ancient times[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
And we've been burned for many crimes[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm7[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]
We have ended many lives[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm7[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
But we never really died[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
You have the sun, I have the moon[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
You have to fly around the world all day[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
To keep the sun upon your face[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm7[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
I'd like to come and comfort you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm7[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
But I'd be blinded by the blue[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
You have the sun, I have the moon[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
You're going to die under the sun[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
And I'll be doomed to carry on[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm7[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
You have become like other men[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm7[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
But let me kiss you once again[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
You have the sun, I have the moon[/tab]

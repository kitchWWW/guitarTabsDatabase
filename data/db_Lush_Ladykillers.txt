Intro:

[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]
[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]
[ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]F#m[/ch] [ch]F#m[/ch]


[tab][ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]         
Here we go, I'm hanging out in Camden[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]Em[/ch]
Drinkin with my girlfriends on a Saturday night[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
This guy says, "come and meet my girlfriend"[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]Bm[/ch]
She's sitting in the corner looking rather uptight[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
So I say "hello" and I try to be nice[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]D#[/ch]
But I see he's feeling itchy[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
Trying to play us off each other,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]B[/ch]
"Girls, girls, please don't fight" (you get the picture)[/tab]


[tab][ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]
Hey you, the muscles and the long hair[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
Telling me that women are superior to men[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
Most guys just don't appreciate this[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
You just try convincing me you're better than them[/tab]


[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]
So he talks for hours about his sensitive soul[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]D#[/ch]       
And his favorite subject is sex[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
I don't think he even wanted it[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
Whatever, Christ this guy's too much (I wanna tell him)[/tab]


[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm as human as the next girl,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]             
I like a bit of flattery[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]B[/ch]               
But I don't need your practiced lines, your school of charm mentality so[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
Save your breath for someone else and credit me with something more[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
When it comes to men like you,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
I know the score,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]                  
I've heard it all before[/tab]



[No Guitar for this part, clap along]

(Here comes the next one)
Blondie was with me for a summer
He flirted like a maniac but I wouldn't bite
I'm weak and he was so persistent
He only had to have me 'cause I put up a fight


[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Oh God, the boy had such an ego[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
He liked to talk about himself all day and all night[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]     
You think you're such a ladykiller[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
But you were nothing special 'til you turned out the light[/tab]


[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
When he's nice to me he's just nice to himself[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]D#[/ch]
And he's watching his reflection[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm a five foot mirror for adoring himself[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]
Here's seven years bad luck (I wanna tell him)[/tab]


[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
When you say you love me you're just flattering your vanity[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]  
But I don't need your practiced lines, your school of charm mentality so[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]
Save your breath for someone else and credit me with something more[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
When it comes to men like you,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
I know the score,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
I've heard it all before[/tab]


[tab][ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Ooh, you're such a ladykiller, always on a winner, thinking that you're in there[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Oh boy, you're such a ladykiller, super sexy mister, call it what you will, oh[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Bm[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
You think you're such a ladykiller, I just bet you're still there, posing in the mirror[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]Bm[/ch]
Hey girls, he's such a ladykiller, but we know where he's coming from and we know the score. [/tab]

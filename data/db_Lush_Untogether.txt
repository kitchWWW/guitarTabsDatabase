IT'S NOT EASY BUT TRY TO PICTURE THIS[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT WE WERE ONCE TOGETHER[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
ISN'T IT STRANGE, ISN'T IT[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I'M SORRY IT'S COME TO THIS BUT[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
WHY ARE WE HERE, BOTHERING WHAT WAS IT WE TALKED ABOUT[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
JUST REMIND ME OF WHY WERE WASTING SO MUCH[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
TIME PRETENDING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
ONLY THIS[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
ONLY THIS POINTLESS ACCUSATION[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
TELL ME AGAIN, WHY ARE WE HERE?[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I'M NOT OFFENDED BY THE THINGS THAT YOU SAY[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
CAUSE IT'S SUCH A PREDICTABLE WAY TO BEHAVE[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
TALK AND INSULT ME TIL YOU'RE BLUE IN THE FACE[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
YOU WERE RIGHT I WAS WRONG NOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I'M QUITE AWARE OF ALL THE BAD THINGS I DO[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMIND ME OF WHY YOU DISLIKE ME[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
BUT THAT'S NO SOLUTION TO THE MESS THAT WERE IN[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
IT'S SO SAD AND SO BORING I WISH YOU'D JUST LEAVE ME ALONE[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
BUT I UNDERSTAND THE GAMES YOU PLAY[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
I'M ASHAMED OF ALL THE THINGS I DID TO YOU[/tab]

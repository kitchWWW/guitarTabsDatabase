[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
Look outside your window[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
Tell me what you see[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]
Past all the flowers[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]
Beyond the trees[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Bm[/ch]
Is it what you wanted?[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
Your life to be[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]B7[/ch]
Or is it what you[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]  
Settle for[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
Is it 'cause they laugh at you[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]
And talk about you too[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
They talked about Jesus Christ[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]Em[/ch]
What makes you think they won't talk about you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]
No need to worry[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]
You are a star[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]B7[/ch]
And you are perfect just the way you are[/tab]


[Chorus:]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]   
Keep on dreaming[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
Keep on shining[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
Keep on grinding[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]
Don't stop trying[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
Keep on dreaming[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
Keep on flowing[/tab]

Keep on growing[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B7[/ch]     
Don't stop hoping[/tab]
Don't stop hoping

[Verse 2:]
(Gwone) Walkin through the graveyard
Shovel in your hand
Rumors on the street are
You just buried a man
And he was really talented
He just didn't get a chance
And now his blood is
On your hand
Maybe you should dig him up
Maybe you should not
Maybe you should stop listening to your friends
And listen to your heart
It's nice to be famous
It's nice to be a star
But it's also nice to be just who you are

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]
People say the craziest things[/tab]
Craziest things
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                          [ch]Bm[/ch]
Twenty-five to life he done murdered his dreams[/tab]
Murdered his dreams
Ummmhuh, ummmhuh, ummhuh

[Chorus x2]

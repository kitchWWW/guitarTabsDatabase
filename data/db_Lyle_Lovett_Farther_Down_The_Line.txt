This time he sure drew a bad one
One that nobody could ride
But by the way he pulled his hat on
You knew he'd be there for the fight

And it's the classic contradiction  (Bb-Bb-F)
The unavoidable affliction
Well, it don't take much to predict, son
The way it always goes

'Cuz one day she says she loves you   (Bb-Bb-F)
And the next she'll be tired of you
And push'll always come to shove you
On that midnight rodeo

He almost made it to the buzzer
Somehow he gave up in the end
They put one hand around the other
And let that pick-up man hone in

And it was his last chance to ride her
And now he'll have to move along
But he knows back in his mind
He won't be away for long

And it's the classic contradiction
The unavoidable affliction
Well, it don't take much to predict, son
The way it always goes

'Cuz one day she says she loves you
And the next she'll be tired of you
And push'll always come to shove you
On that midnight rodeo

Let's have a hand for that young cowboy   (Bb-Bb-F)
And wish him better luck next time
And hope we see him up in Fargo
Or somewhere farther down the line  End : Bb-Am-C

[Intro]
[ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch] [ch]Ab[/ch] x2

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
Now we reached the end[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Cm[/ch]          [ch]Ab[/ch]
I ran the marathon[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch]            [ch]Bb[/ch]
The road had many bends[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Fm[/ch]            [ch]Cm[/ch]
But we knew that all along[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Bb[/ch]
I think it made me stronger[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Fm[/ch]             [ch]Ab[/ch]
But I would rather not[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Eb[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]Ab[/ch]
Betray myself, just to keep your love at any cost[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]Fm[/ch]        [ch]Ab[/ch]               [ch]Cm[/ch]
And it's most tempting to give in[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]Fm[/ch]
When you hear the firin' shots[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Ab[/ch]                 [ch]Cm[/ch]
When you're steps from winning back[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]Fm[/ch]     ([ch]Ab[/ch]) [ch]Cm[/ch]        [ch]Bb[/ch]
All the happiness you lo-o-o-ost, lo-o-o-o-ost[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]     ([ch]Ab[/ch]) [ch]Cm[/ch]        [ch]Bb[/ch]
Lo-o-o-ost, lo-o-o-o-ost[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]Fm[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]Ab[/ch]
With every careless action you let me slip away[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Fm[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]          [ch]Eb[/ch]            [ch]Ab[/ch]
If you just bought me flowers, maybe I would've stayed[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Fm[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]Eb[/ch]                [ch]Ab[/ch]
You didn't think I was serious, I guess you felt so safe[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Fm[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]          [ch]Eb[/ch]            [ch]Ab[/ch]
If you just bought mе flowers, maybe I would've stayеd[/tab]

[Post-Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]Eb[/ch]   [ch]Bb[/ch]       [ch]Ab[/ch]
Maybe I would've stayed[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Eb[/ch]   [ch]Bb[/ch]       [ch]Ab[/ch]
Maybe I would've stayed[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Bb[/ch]
The seeds we planted grew[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cm[/ch]             [ch]Ab[/ch]
But not like roses do[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Eb[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
We had the thorns and leaves[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Fm[/ch]               [ch]Cm[/ch]
But the buds, they never bloomed[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch]            [ch]Bb[/ch]
And now my future gleams[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Fm[/ch]              [ch]Ab[/ch]
With colors bold and bright[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Eb[/ch]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]
In a home that's filled with love and hope[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Ab[/ch]
And a life that just feels right[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]Fm[/ch]        ([ch]Ab[/ch])             [ch]Cm[/ch]
And it's most tempting to give in[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]Fm[/ch]
When you're almost at the top[/tab]
[tab]            ([ch]Ab[/ch])               [ch]Cm[/ch]
When you're steps from winning back[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]Fm[/ch]     ([ch]Ab[/ch]) [ch]Cm[/ch]       [ch]Bb[/ch]
All the happiness you lo-o-o-ost, lo-o-o-o-ost[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]     ([ch]Ab[/ch]) [ch]Cm[/ch]       [ch]Bb[/ch]
Lo-o-o-ost, lo-o-o-o-ost[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]Fm[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]Ab[/ch]

You didn't think I was serious, I guess you felt so safe[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Fm[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]          [ch]Eb[/ch]            [ch]Ab[/ch]
If you just bought mе flowers, maybe I would've stayеd[/tab]

[Post-Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]Eb[/ch]   [ch]Bb[/ch]       [ch]Ab[/ch]
Maybe I would've stayed[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Eb[/ch]   [ch]Bb[/ch]       [ch]Ab[/ch]
Maybe I would've stayed[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Eb[/ch]            [ch]Bb[/ch]      [ch]Ab[/ch]
I wouldn't have walked away[/tab]

I wouldn't have walked away[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]    [ch]Fm[/ch]
And there's no heartbreak left to feel[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Cm[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
It happened years ago[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Fm[/ch]
After you made your choices[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Cm[/ch]            [ch]Bb[/ch]
I melted away like snow[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Fm[/ch]             [ch]Ab[/ch]
'Cause you like lying to yourself[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cm[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
And now I'll never know[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Fm[/ch]
What parts of your love were for real[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cm[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
And what parts were for show[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]Fm[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]Ab[/ch]

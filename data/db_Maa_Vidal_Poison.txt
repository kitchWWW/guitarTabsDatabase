Like Chaucer's
Canterbury tales
When three men find a pot of gold
And kill another in the name of greed
Some people are poison (Poison)
Under my skin like opium
And I'll stare in their eye to annoy them
All they're poison
Yeah, they're poison
Admissions of liabilities
I'm living in my own cold war
In a room full of spies and I cannot find the door
Some people are poison (poison)
Under my skin like opium
And I'll stare in their eye to annoy them
All they're poison
Yeah, they're poison
The violent aspects of a tattered man
Let me respond to that if I can
Illuminated Manuscripts written by hand
Accusations have been made form the very beginning
Some people are poison
Under my skin like opium
And I'll stare in their eye to annoy them
All they're poison
Yeah, they're poison

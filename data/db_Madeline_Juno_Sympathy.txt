"Oh hey, it's me. I don't know if you'll get this
but I just wanted you to know that it's been just too much
and I'm so done with it all and it's, it's over. Bye."


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]EM7[/ch]
You're like the fallen leaves on the pavement[/tab]

You lost yourself and your colour again
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
You're like the trees bending with the wind[/tab]

You fear the storm


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]EM7[/ch]
I am the northern wind, I'm cold as ice[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G#m[/ch]
Under my skin so pale like snow[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
I'm pouring down on your face[/tab]

I'm pouring down on your story, so long


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]EM7[/ch]
I am a cup of tea[/tab]

I have burnt your skin just with my touch
[tab]                        [ch]G#m[/ch]
You won't come close to me ever again[/tab]

Won't taste me ever again


[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]G#m[/ch]
And you're running like a child[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]
The world's got no sympathy this time[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]G#m[/ch]
You lost the piece of mind[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]B[/ch]           [ch]F#[/ch]
You liked the most, I know[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]G#m[/ch]
And you're running like a child[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]F#[/ch]
From what you know deep inside is right[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]G#m[/ch]
I was there to hold on tight[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]       [ch]F#[/ch]        [ch]EM7[/ch]
As we set our hearts on fire[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]EM7[/ch]
You're like that one favourite book that I used to love[/tab]

That I've read a hundred times
[tab]                      [ch]G#m7[/ch]
I'm gonna burn it down to the ground[/tab]

I'm gonna throw it out, out, out


[Verse 5]
[tab][ch]EM7[/ch]
You're like the weight of the whole world on my shoulder[/tab]

You try to bring me down
[tab]               [ch]G#m7[/ch]
You make it seem worse than it is[/tab]

You make me feel worse than I did


[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]G#m7[/ch]
And you're running like a child[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]B[/ch]           [ch]F#[/ch]
The world's got no sympathy this time[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]G#m[/ch]
You lost the piece of mind[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]B[/ch]         [ch]F#[/ch]
You liked the most, I know[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]G#m[/ch]
And you're running like a child[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]B[/ch]           [ch]F#[/ch]
From what you know deep inside is right[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]G#m7[/ch]
I was there to hold on tight[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]B[/ch]   [ch]F#[/ch]        [ch]EM7[/ch]
As we set our hearts on fire[/tab]

[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
Fireâ€¦[/tab]


[Chorus 2]
[tab]       [ch]EM7[/ch]        [ch]G#m7[/ch]
And get out of my mind[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]B[/ch]
The world's got no sympathy this time[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]G#m7[/ch]
Get out of my head[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]       [ch]F#[/ch]      [ch]EM7[/ch]
As I set our hearts on fire[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab] [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]F#[/ch]
(Fire, fire, fire, fire)[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]EM7[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]      [ch]G#m7[/ch]
(Fire, fire, fire, fire)[/tab]

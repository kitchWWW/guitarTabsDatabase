Adalia (Acoustic) - Madina Lake

Just to make sure we're clear, this is NOT how ML plays it, nor it this how
the folks on YouTube are playing it.  It looks to me like they're using some
kind of alternate tuning--possibly an open E--but if you play it like this,
it will sound nearly identical.

Leave your guitar in standard tuning, and use the chords below.  Just put
your ring and/or pinky fingers on the B and high-E strings along the 3rd
fret.  The chord names below technically are not correct, but they're
basically right.

Pick and strum around until you get it right.  Enjoy!

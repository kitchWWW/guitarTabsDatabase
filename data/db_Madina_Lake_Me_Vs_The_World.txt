Me Vs. the World - Madina Lake - From Them, Through Us, To You

This is my favorite track off of Madina Lake's "From Them, Through Us, To You" album.
loud, fast, and a lot of fun to play.  I hope you enjoy.  If you don't have the album, go
it, and even better go see these guys live.  Their shows are wicked.

I'm not sure how Madina Lake plays this song, but I play with standard tuning on the
guitar and pick around on the chords.  On the electric I use drop D and play mostly power
on the bottom 3 strings.  There are a few parts where the lyrics overlap (too many 
not enough beats) but I tried to keep it as easy to follow as I could.  Follow along
the song a few times to get the flow and rythmn down if you need.  This is pretty easy song.

Thanks,
WiLL

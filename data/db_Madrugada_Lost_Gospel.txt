This is the tab to the guitar playing which is prominent in the beginning 
of the song, and plays pretty much throughout the whole thing.
You only strum three strings, like shown below.
I'm not 100% about this, because I might be affected by the bass, but it
sounds pretty accurate.

Well oh Lord

Last only for a day
And they'll stay with you for another day

Oh no I never ever want this thing to pass
One should never fall in love with things that last
Last only for a day
And they'll stay with you for another day
No no I never ever want this thing to pass
One should never fall in love with things that last
Last only for a day
And they'll stay with you for another day

[Verse 1]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
It don't make much sense[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
You and me we've got everything[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    
But you can't wrap your head around[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
Gettin' gone from where you've been[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Well, it ain't that hard[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
To see the hole that I'm standin' in[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                         [ch]D[/ch]
So stop lookin' at you, and start lookin' at me[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
You'll see what a wreck I've been[/tab]

[CHORUS]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
So jump in my world[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
Come take a look through these tears[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And just get a glimpse of the heartache[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
I feel in here[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Do some time in this bittersweet hell[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
That I'm walkin' through[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Put yourself in my blues[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Put yourself in my blues[/tab]

[VERSE 2]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
See I get to hate you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And I get to unravel now[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
You know I start breakin' things[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Every time I start breakin' down[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          
Oh, so don't try to kiss me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Cause you know that always works[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
And baby I swear if we're gonna go there[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Well you're gonna taste the hurt[/tab]

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[BRIDGE] (PLAY THIS CONTINUOUSLY AFTER THE CHORUS, LIKE DONT STOP):

[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch] 
Don't you miss being here[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Don't you miss being us[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]*(HOLD)
No one else gonna love you this much[/tab]

[CHORUS] (SAME CHORDS AS BEFORE)

So jump in my world
And come take a look through these tears
And just get a glimpse of the heartache
That I feel in here, yeah yeah
Do some time in this bittersweet hell
That I'm walkin' through
Put yourself in my blues &gt; [ch]G[/ch] - [ch]C[/ch]
Put yourself in my blues &gt; [ch]G[/ch] - [ch]C[/ch]
Put yourself in my blues &gt; [ch]G[/ch] - [ch]C[/ch]

                END ON [ch]G[/ch] 

This is my first tab ever and the first song I learned entirely by ear, so I hope it sounds right!
Have Fun!

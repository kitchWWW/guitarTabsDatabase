[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
I wanna love you like in movies[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
A ticket for two, please[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
You could've been that man[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
If this was really showbiz[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
you would give me roses[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And I would take your hand, ah[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Hollywood made it look easy[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Why'd it have to tease me?[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
I don't understand[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]
I tried to love like in the movies[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]
But, all I got was plastic plants[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
(All I got was plastic plants)[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
(All I got was plastic plants)[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
I've got something inside me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
That I wanna confess (Wanna confess)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
You've been cutting your ties and[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
I don't wanna be that (Wanna be that)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
I've (I've) got (Got) something inside me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
That (That) I (I) wanna confess (Wanna confess)[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
If your roses are dead and your violets ain't true[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
I don't wanna grow next to you[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
I thought that our love would be a series[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]
Always have you near me[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah, that was the plan[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
You were meant to call me on the daily[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Link me like a daisy chain up on my hand[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]C[/ch]
Hollywood made me think it was simple[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]
I took it too literal[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
Now I understand, huh[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
I thought you were growing up[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
Thought we'd have a real romance, huh (Thought we would)[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
But all I got was plastic plants[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
I've got something inside me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
That I wanna confess (Wanna confess)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
You've been cutting your ties and[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
I don't wanna be that (Wanna be that)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
I've (I've) got (Got) something inside me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
That (That) I (I) wanna confess (Wanna confess)[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
If your roses are dead and your violets ain't true[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
I don't wanna grow next to you[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
You're gonna know what you did when I don't holla back, babe[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
Look at me (Look at me)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
I was your girl, but you never gave me jack, babe[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
Can't you see? (Can't you see?)[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
Now we've grown apart (Yeah, huh)[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
Didn't even try, so the love ran dry[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]
Now we're back at the start[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
You had your chance, you just gave me plastic plants[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
I've got something inside me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]

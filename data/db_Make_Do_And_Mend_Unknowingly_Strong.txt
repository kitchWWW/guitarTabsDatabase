Lyrics:

Believe me when I say
that there will always be cold days,
but the grass is only greener here if you plant it that way.
So you can lock yourself away,
give up, forget, go back to sleep,
or you can realize that there is so much more to life than yesterday.

I don't need a life preserver to keep my head above the waves,
no matter where the current takes me.
'Cause I want to find out what it means to walk an even plane
where I don't need a pacifier to keep my wits about me

I'm writing the letters on the wall
to remind myself to get back up every time I fall.
And maybe just wading will save me,
and maybe the ebbing tide will suck me underneath.
I've had so much trouble keeping all these worries from my head.
I'll keep swimming 'til I'm dead.

I don't need a life preserver to keep my head above the waves,
no matter where the current takes me.
'Cause I want to find out what it means to walk an even plane
where I don't need a pacifier to keep my wits about me

This is the day we all begin to let our fear go and learn to swim.
This is the day we all begin to let our fear go and learn to swim.

Believe me when I say
that there will always be cold days,
but the grass is only greener here if you plant it that way.

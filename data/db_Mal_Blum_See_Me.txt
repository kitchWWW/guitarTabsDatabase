[Verse 1]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
I fall down[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
But I get up[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
I've been here so long[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cm[/ch]
Feels like nothin' anymore[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
I'll think of you[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
Don't brush me off[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
Both got bruises on our knees[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Cm[/ch]
Don't waste your worries, not on me.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
I don't belong[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Though it helps to play along[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]
Why can't they see me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
Why can't they see me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Cm[/ch]
Why can't they see me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
Why can't they see me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]
Why can't they see me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
Why can't they see me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]
Why can't they see[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G5[/ch]   [ch]A5[/ch]  [ch]C5[/ch]
When I'm right here[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]A5[/ch]  [ch]C5[/ch]
I'm right here[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
When I get back[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
High in the bath[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
Let the water cover me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Cm[/ch]
Down my back and in my beak[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
I'm free at last[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
But where I'm clipped[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
It don't bother me a bit[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Cm[/ch]
When I don't stop to think of it[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
I won't be long[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
When I am home I am still gone[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]
Why can't they see me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
Why can't they see me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Cm[/ch]
Why can't they see me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
Why can't they see me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]
Why can't they see me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
Why can't they see me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Cm[/ch]
Why can't they see[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G5[/ch]  [ch]A5[/ch]  [ch]C5[/ch]
When I'm right here[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G5[/ch]  [ch]A5[/ch]  [ch]C5[/ch]
When I'm right here[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
And at the show[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]
When I'm in the crowd[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
You can't lick my wounds for me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Cm[/ch]
The ones that grin and bare their teeth[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
Just put me down[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
But I'll be around[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
Mouth the words that I can't say[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Cm[/ch]
I wish that I would fade away[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
But that don't last long[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
Wait 'til tomorrow it will be gone. It will.[/tab]

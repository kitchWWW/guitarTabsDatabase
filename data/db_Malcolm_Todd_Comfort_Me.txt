Artist: Malcolm Todd
Song: Comfort Me
Genre: 
Key: 


The tabs are correct, during the song the
bass will change speed. especially on the
1st part. You don’t have to play “4” on the
end of the 2nd part. I added it cuz i like
it

[tab] 1st part:
G|--------------------------------|
D|--------------------------------|
A|--------------------------------|
E|-2-4-5-7-9---9-7---7---7-9-5----|[/tab]

[tab] 2nd part:
G|---------------------------------|
D|-------------6-------------------|
A|-----------9---9---9-------------|
E|-2-4-5-7-9-------7---7-8-9-7-5-4-|[/tab]

Everything will repeat itself and thats
basically the song.

[tab]           [ch]G/D[/ch]
My dad, he worked out west and he works so hard[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
My mum, she smells like cigarettes and they broke each others hearts[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G/D[/ch]
She says that love is like a chess game and boys gotta do the chasing[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
But when did I start taking her advice, I raised myself and that's alright. I want -[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]G/D[/ch]
Oh, I was really feeling nothing, but you got me feeling something[/tab]

And it's heartfelt like ice melts when winter turns to spring[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G/D[/ch]
And I keep your pictures like a hoarder, I think about you when I sing[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
Said you can lead a horse to water but you can't always make it drink. So I drink -[/tab]

I just might love you forever, I hope you warm up to me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
I think you might be my angel, think you might be an angel[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
I think you might be an angel, I think you might be[/tab]

[Bridge]

Lyrics:

Somedays I wake up, I don't have a plan
I hear what they're sayin', I don't understand..
I know you're out there..
I can't hear you call..
I wish I never met you, I can't forget about you at all

If I could do anything right now, I would run..
I'll come back after.. I'll come back after..
If I could do anything right now, I would run..
I'll come back after.. I'll come back after..

Somedays I wake up, I don't have a plan
The whole world just crumbles inside of my hands,
And I know you don't care, you don't care at all,
If I could learn to let go, it would be the second feet for the fall

If I could do anything right now, I would run..
I'll come back after.. I'll come back after..
If I could do anything right now, I would run..
I'll come back after.. I'll come back after..

I held my breath, with every word,
You ran away with every step you took,
So please my dear, sleep sound tonight,
I wish that I could I still make things alright..

If I could do anything right now, I would run..
I'll come back after.. I'll come back after..
If I could do anything right now, I would run..
I'll come back after.. I'll come back after..

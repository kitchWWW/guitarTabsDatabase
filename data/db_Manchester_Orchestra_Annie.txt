[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]                  [ch]Cm[/ch]       [ch]Gm[/ch]
I thought this time I might just walk away from you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Eb[/ch]                         [ch]Bb[/ch]
You were a thief, yeah, and I was the proof[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Cm[/ch]                     [ch]Gm[/ch]
But you don't ever cry, so no telling the truth[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]Cm[/ch]       [ch]Gm[/ch]
The first time that I tried to run away from you[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Eb[/ch]                          [ch]Bb[/ch]
You gave me a list, said, "Now, baby, you choose"[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Cm[/ch]                          [ch]Gm[/ch]
But it wasn't engraved, it felt more like a bruise[/tab]


[Chorus 1]
[tab]              [ch]Cm[/ch]
Oh, I wasn't ashamed then[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Gm[/ch]
Of my degree[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch]        [ch]Dm7[/ch]    [ch]Cm[/ch]       [ch]Bb[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
The fear that I once paid for now was free[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Cm[/ch]
But I wasn't afraid then[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
Of who I'd become[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Eb[/ch]        [ch]Dm7[/ch]    [ch]Cm[/ch]       [ch]Bb[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
In a desperate vain attempt to talk to God[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Gm[/ch]
I saw, I saw[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                     [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]Cm[/ch]          [ch]Gm[/ch]
Now I'm the same, lost my decree, and it paid for you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb[/ch]                          [ch]Bb[/ch]
I was a liar, I was stuck in the fog[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Cm[/ch]                       [ch]Gm[/ch]
Yeah, and you were turnеd around, I was pretty much lost[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Bb[/ch]             [ch]Cm[/ch]          [ch]Gm[/ch]
I'm the first of four that tried to cast away from you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Eb[/ch]                [ch]Bb[/ch]
Into thе dark, you were a spear[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Cm[/ch]                         [ch]Gm[/ch]
I was holding your head, you were watching me kneel[/tab]


[Chorus 2]
[tab]             [ch]Cm[/ch]
I was barely born then[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Gm[/ch]
I was hardly evolved[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Eb[/ch]     [ch]Dm7[/ch]      [ch]Cm[/ch]       [ch]Bb[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]
I was pacing back and forth to calm the squall[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Cm[/ch]
So I ran out of reasons[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
Of places to fall[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Eb[/ch]      [ch]Dm7[/ch]       [ch]Cm[/ch]      [ch]Bb[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
Would you take my heart and nail it to your wall?[/tab]

I saw, I saw

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                                   [ch]Cm[/ch]
Once you reach the top it takes your air[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb[/ch]  [ch]Bb[/ch]
Are you hollow?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb[/ch]   [ch]Bb[/ch]                               [ch]Cm[/ch]
Are you holl-lower than you think you've ever been?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb[/ch]  [ch]Bb[/ch]
Are you hollow?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb[/ch]  [ch]Bb[/ch]
Are you hollow?[/tab]


[Chorus 3]
[tab]                   [ch]Cm[/ch]
I don't want to believe it[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Gm[/ch]
Stuck in my thought[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Eb[/ch]        [ch]Dm7[/ch]   [ch]Cm[/ch]      [ch]Bb[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
I've been trying to replicate the mask of God[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Cm[/ch]
Now I'm starting to feel it[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Bb[/ch]
Now the guilt's falling off[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Eb[/ch]        [ch]Dm7[/ch]    [ch]Cm[/ch]      [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
When I turned my eyes around, I learned to talk[/tab]

I saw, I saw

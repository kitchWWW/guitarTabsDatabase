[Verse 1]

[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G/B[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
Don't let them see you cry[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G/B[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch] 
When the dam breaks down and the city is covered in water[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G/B[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
Cause I believe we fly[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G/B[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
When the moon takes shape and I dose off, on your shoulders[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]    ([ch]C[/ch])      [ch]G/B[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
I trust that you see it too (ooh oh oh ooh oh oh) (x2)[/tab]

[Verse 2]
(same as verse 1)

So breathe while you're alive
Let the big band play as you tap leather with your fingers
And I tried to write in style
But the words just come and I write them as soon as I see them

[Chorus]

[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]Fm[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]    ([ch]C[/ch])       [ch]G/B[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
And I trust that you write them too (ooh oh oh ooh oh oh) (x2)[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]Fm[/ch]
And I trust that you love me too[/tab]

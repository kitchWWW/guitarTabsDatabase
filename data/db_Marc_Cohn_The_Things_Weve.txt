I don't know much about you,  I don't know who you are[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
And we'd been doing fine without you  but we could only go so far[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
I don't know why you chose us, were you watching from above[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
Is there someone there that knows us  said we'd give you all our love[/tab]


[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
I wonder who you'll look like  will your hair fall down and curl[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Will you be a momma's boy or daddy's little girl[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Will you be a sad reminder of what's been lost along the way[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
Maybe you can help me find her in the things you do and say[/tab]


[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Will you laugh just like your mother will you sigh like your old man[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Will some things skip a generation like I've heard they often can[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
Are you a poet or a dancer, a devil or a clown[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]Bm[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
Or a strange new combination of the things we've handed down[/tab]


[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
You may not always be so grateful for the way that you were made[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Maybe some feature of your father's that you'd gladly sell or trade[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
And one day you may look at us and say that you were cursed[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
But over time that line has been extremely well rehearsed[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
By our fathers and their fathers in some old and distant town[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
>From places no one here remembers come the things we've handed down[/tab]

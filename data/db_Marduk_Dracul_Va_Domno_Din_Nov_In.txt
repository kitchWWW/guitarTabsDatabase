Lyrics.

All demons ride high upon the bewitching nightsky
they are only disturbed by a newborn childs painful cry
Son of the great dragon come forth to rule
In all your glory, no man, no beast will be as cruel.
All the angels and the puny men of god looked away
frightened to death by th evil that was born on that day.
Dracul come forth and see your son's soul is powerful
Triumphantly holding his son, nothing could be as delightful.

In our order you are now for the sake of our greatness
You must murder the muslim turks in thousands no less
Let them feel our neverending wrath and our steel
we are men of god so let them know it for real.
It's our mission to seek our enemies and kill them one by one
They must be destroyed in time be sure to teach your newborn son.
We must bath in the blood of the vermins called turks to win
The muslims are to be executed for they live in great sin.

Sultan Murad of the turks are getting more powerful each day
Dracul will not be one of them thats for his mercy will pray
He must turn his back on his previous allies and conspirate with the turks
Beware you all of the evil blood that in Dracul hurks
The holy roman emperor will get angered with this
But Dracul must protect himself, it's a right of his
So feel the greedy claws of death you weak men of god
Treacherous thoughts was the father of the berserker prince Vlad.

Seven years age is he and already in bloody war
His eyes does not turn away from all that death and gore
Father Dracul and brother Mircea is riding by his side
Proud he is of his warrior father no matter he died.
Together with the turks they ravaged through the land
dragon and beast, devils and demons fighting hand in hand.
Transilvania you great home of ours you they will crush
There is no god to help us.

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
Hey, hey.....[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
You're almost home[/tab]
You're almost home
[tab]               [ch]Bm[/ch]
You're almost home[/tab]


[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]
I've seen the light in the sky[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
In the skies are like fireflies[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Bm[/ch]
Burning bright, just to vanish in the dark[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
I've held hope in my two hands[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]
That there would be another chance[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Bm[/ch]
To find the kingdom, I'm believing in my heart[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
Cause underneath the good there's something greater than you know[/tab]


Chorus:
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
When you're almost there[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]
And you're almost home[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Just open up your eyes and go, go[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
When you're almost there, almost home[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
Know you're not alone[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
You're almost home, almost home.[/tab]


[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
When you run, run so far[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
You've forgotten who you are[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Bm[/ch]
Where you're from, it's like some other universe[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]                        
You count your steps, like they're regrets[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
You catch one breath then lose the rest[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]  
Wrong is right, right is left[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Bm[/ch]
And there's nowhere left to turn[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
So don't believe in everything[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
You think, you think you know[/tab]


Chorus:
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
When you're almost there[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]
And you're almost home[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Just open up your eyes and go, go[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
When you're almost there, almost home[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
Know you're not alone[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
You're almost home, almost home[/tab]


[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
When you let your heart be the compass[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
You won't get lost, not if you trust it[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
When you hear the sound of the trumpet[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
Louder than ever before[/tab]

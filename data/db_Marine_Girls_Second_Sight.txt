[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Bm7[/ch]                       [ch]Em7[/ch]
When I wake at night and he's still here and [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am7[/ch]
Second sight is something I no longer need [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D7[/ch]
To know I hope he'll always be [/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Bm7[/ch]                  [ch]Em7[/ch]
Every day I find he takes up all my mind and time[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Catching, stealing through my dreams [/tab]
[tab][ch]D7[/ch]
Against my will or so it seems [/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Makes me cry some nights[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em7[/ch] 
When the things he says I know are right [/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm7[/ch]
Reason only goes to show [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]             [ch]D7[/ch]
Things I didn't want to know [/tab]

[Vers 4]
[tab][ch]Bm7[/ch]
Then he smiles once more[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em7[/ch]
And wonders who I was before[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am7[/ch]
So much it seems I didn't know [/tab]
[tab][ch]D7[/ch]
If can love can scare me so [/tab]

[Verse 5]
[tab][ch]Bm7[/ch]
For now I feel the change [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em7[/ch]
My days before appear so strange [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am7[/ch]
The way I viewed the world outside [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D7[/ch]
Have left me with so much to hide [/tab]

[Verse 6]
[tab][ch]Bm7[/ch]
Though we've known before[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em7[/ch]
So many times of being sure [/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am7[/ch]
I know that love may slip away [/tab]
[tab][ch]D7[/ch]
Something I refuse to say [/tab]

[Verse 7]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Smiles and makes me laugh [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em7[/ch]
Then tears a restless stream in half [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm7[/ch]
With careful words that know too well   [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am7[/ch]                 [ch]D7[/ch]
The face of hopes you should not tell [/tab]

[Verse 8]
[tab][ch]Bm7[/ch]
Shakes me free from size [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em7[/ch]
And rushes sadness from my eyes [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Tells me not to live in fear [/tab]
[tab][ch]D7[/ch] 
Words I hope to never hear [/tab]

[Verse 9]
[tab][ch]Bm7[/ch]                             [ch]Em7[/ch]
The must be love in store for a girl who never knew before [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
You might say that I'm naive [/tab]
[tab][ch]D7[/ch]
Am I wrong to believe?[/tab]

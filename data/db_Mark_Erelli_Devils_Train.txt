[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch]

[Verse 1]
N.C.
The Devil's train is long and black
N.C.
And it rides on rails of tears
N.C.
And it's headed for destruction now
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
With a drunken engineer[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Oh, see the greatness of the crowd[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
That waits beside the track[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
They're leaving on that Devil's train[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
And never coming back[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Oh lord, please stop that Devil's train[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Before it is too late[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
And teach them how to kiss your ass[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Before they seal their fate[/tab]

[Verse 3] 
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
The Devil's train will take you to[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
A land of groans and pains[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
You'll spend your days in sorrow[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
If you ride that Devil's train[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Oh, listen to that whistle scream[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
Like echoes from the blue[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
The throttle's wide and spouting steam[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
She's on her way to doom[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Oh lord, please stop that Devil's train[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Before it is too late[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
And teach them how to kiss your ass[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Before they seal their fate[/tab]

[Verse 5]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
The Devil's train is long and black[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
And it's beautiful to see[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
It offers you temptation[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
But it brings you misery[/tab]

[Verse 6]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
So come and ride that glorious train[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
Where happiness is free[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
It's on its way to Hell right now[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
To spend eternity[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Oh lord, please stop that Devil's train[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Before it is too late[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
And teach them how to kiss your ass[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Before they seal their fate[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Oh lord, please stop that Devil's train[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Before it is too late[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
And teach them how to kiss your ass[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Before they seal their fate[/tab]

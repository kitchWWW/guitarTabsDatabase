[Verse 1]
[tab]N.C.        [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em7[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
It's why an old bench seat at a red light mean it ain't going home time yet[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em7[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
And how a glass of wine at closing time just tasting bitter sweet[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Em7[/ch]
It's how the words work in a song oh to pause time a little bit[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Em7[/ch]
It's why we take the long way home so this night don't have to end[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
But you don't know a damn thing about love[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Till it's already good and gone[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
But I can't tell you how to love[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em7[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
But I can tell you where I went wrong[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
Cause someone always wants to find right now[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Em7[/ch]
And it don't matter if you're goin get hurt[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Cause feeling better today doesn't hurt tomorrow[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
And you don't have wipe away[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
All the tears that you ain't cried yet[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Em7[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
And all the calls that you don't wanna get[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Cause baby that's why falling in love with tonight[/tab]

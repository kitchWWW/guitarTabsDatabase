Comin' out around the world
Are you ready for a brand-new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancin' in the street
Down in Dayton, Ohio (dancin' in the street)
Down in New Orleans (dancin' in the street)
In New York City (dancin' in the street)

Chorus:
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
All we need is music, sweet music[/tab]
There'll be music everywhere
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
There'll be swingin', swayin', and records playin'[/tab]
Dancin' in the street
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
   It doesn't matter what you wear[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
Just as long as you are there[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F#m[/ch]
So come on, every guy, grab a girl[/tab]
[tab][ch]B7[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]
Everywhere around the world they're dancin'[/tab]
They're dancin' in the street (dancin' in the street)

Verse 2:
This is an invitation across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughin', singin', and music swingin'
Dancin' in the street
Philadelphia, PA (dancin' in the street)
In Washington DC now (dancin' in the street)
Can't forget the Motor City (dancin' in the street)

(chorus)

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
They've got it in L.A., every day[/tab]
They're dancin' in the street (dancin' in the street)
Across the Big Straw Line, dancin' in time
They're dancin' in the street (dancin' in the street)
Across the ocean blue, me and you
We're dancin' in the street (dancin' in the street)
...and fade

[Intro]
[ch]Dmaj7[/ch]  [ch]Em7[/ch]  [ch]A7[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Dmaj7[/ch]             [ch]Em7[/ch]
  Second chances,    I've had them all my life[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]                   [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
  But I know that they   never come around twice.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dmaj7[/ch]                  [ch]Em7[/ch]
  Second changes, I've had them ever since I was a child.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]                    [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
  Nice to see you again,   sure has been a while.[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Dmaj7[/ch]                             [ch]Em7[/ch]
  Striking out at baseball didn't matter when I was ten.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]                                                  [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
  The coach would tell me just swing level and he'd put me back in again.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dmaj7[/ch]                            [ch]Em7[/ch]
  But as we grow up those second chances are few and far between.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]                            [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
  And I keep waiting for that second chance for you and me.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]              [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
  Second chances happen when you least expect them to[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em7[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]          [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
And I wonder if they were ever meant for me and you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em7[/ch]                [ch]A7[/ch]         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
Cause if you're willing, so am I to    give our love one more try[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em7[/ch]   N.C.                         [ch]A7[/ch] N.C.              [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
So for the first time, don't let this   second chance pass us by.[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Dmaj7[/ch]                               [ch]Em7[/ch]
  Some people spend their time just wishing their lives away[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A7[/ch] N.C.                [ch]A7[/ch]  N.C.                [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
"I should've done this, I should've done that" is all I hear them say[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]                        [ch]Em7[/ch]
So I made myself a promise if I ever ran into you[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A7[/ch]                                            [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
I wouldn't think twice, take my own advice, and ask you   do you think it's true, yeah[/tab]

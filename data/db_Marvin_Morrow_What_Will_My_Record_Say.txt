Someday for my life, this hurt is over, and I move to that land far away.[/tab]

What will be written in the book of life that will open on that great day?[/tab]

Will I be proud or hang my head?[/tab]

With the time I've been given while here on this earth, should I stay?[/tab]

Our heaping, my brother.[/tab]

Genre: 
Key: 


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
Every night she sleeps alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
And by her bed she puts the phone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
And every morning after that[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
She takes the phone and puts it back[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
Now he's got a wife back home and three kids up and grown[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]
But these are things that go unsaid[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
He might call her from the road just in time[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
To say 'Hello' and 'Goodbye' again[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]
She keeps his picture tucked away[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
She thinks she'll have it framed some day[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F[/ch]
And maybe he'll come see it there[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]
Hanging by her rocking chair[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
In a corner of her room, on a Sunday afternoon[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]
When all the world is dull and gray[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
She might close her eyes and sit, rocking gently for a bit[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]
Till all the bad thoughts go away[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
Back when children played their games[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
London bridge and Jesse James[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
She captured flags, she bounced the ball[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
And every time she beat them all[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
And now she comes home to her cat in a three room walk up flat[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
And plays a game of solitaire, well she made a fist last night[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]
And she broke the hallway light and the pieces scattered everywhere[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
Now he's got a wife back home and three kids up and grown[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]
But these are things that go unsaid[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
He might call her from the road just in time[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
To say 'Hello' and 'Goodbye' again[/tab]

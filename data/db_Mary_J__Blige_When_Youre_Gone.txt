[INTRO] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]F#[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
Seems like we were right[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
But you always have a problem with everything[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Appreciate your advise but sometimes I have trouble managing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Now that I'm paying attention I see how beautiful you are[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
But when you spend so much time together now everything can get so dark[/tab]

[CHORUS]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]                                          [ch]Em[/ch]
Oh when you're gone I'd miss you like I did when we were first together[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]
No one in this world could hold me better[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Bm[/ch]
Just tell me when you're coming home[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]                                         [ch]Em[/ch]
When you're gone I'd miss you like you took a piece of me with you[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Didn't think I'd care that much, did ya?[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
Just tell me when you're coming home[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
Seems like we were right[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
But today I woke on the wrong side[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F#[/ch]
I need silence to keep me right[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
Otherwise the day won't be nice[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
I wanna laugh with you again just like you are my best friends[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
But friends can always breathe[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
And we're too close, and too close is never easy[/tab]

[BRIDGE]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'm not alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
Until you leave me[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Now we all get to sleep tonight[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
Cause you're not here beside me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
When you're away it's never easy[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
You make it all alright, I miss you[/tab]

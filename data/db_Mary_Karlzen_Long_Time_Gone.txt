[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
  Tell me 'bout these things you want, and you know, it don't come easy[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
  The hunger just ain't enough[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
  So you hope and you pray that maybe some day love will come along and find you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
  But it's never quite fast enough[/tab]

So you run, and you hide away, 'cause you just can't take it another day[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
Oh baby, you gotta hold on,    hold on[/tab]

It's gonna be a long time gone[/tab]

I see something in your eyes, 'cause I know, I've been there too
You can't be the only one to have things happen to you
You want for something you can't say or something you can't even touch
And you can't think of anything in this world you've ever wanted as much

So you run, and you hide away, 'cause you just can't take it another day
Oh baby, you gotta hold on, hold on
It's gonna be a long time gone
It's gonna be a long time gone

[guitar solo][/tab]

So you run, and you hide away, 'cause you just can't take it another day
Oh baby, you gotta hold on, hold on
It's gonna be a long time gone
It's gonna be a long, long, long time gone

Gone away, gone away, say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Gone away, gone away, say goodbye, goodbye, running from what you can't find

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
This song’s about the Tomato Vendetta, [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
and the tale of a man who let a[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Hate for tomatoes cause him strife,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                               [ch]D[/ch] 
He lost his job, wife, home, car, kids, and life.[/tab]

[Bridge 1]
[tab][ch]D7[/ch]
He’d go downtown to buy some groceries,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He went because his family was hungry,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
He always bought red meat and potatoes[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
But he wouldn’t touch those ugly tomatoes…[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
He didn’t know why he hated tomatoes,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
They were just as ugly as far as ugly goes, [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch] 
There in the store, when no-one was watchin’,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                                   [ch]D[/ch] 
He’d set melons on them and laugh at their squashin’.[/tab]

[Bridge 2]
[tab][ch]D7[/ch]
One night after shopping and on his way home,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
His loathing for tomatoes cut to the bone,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
He just couldn’t stand the strain any more,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
He vowed to destroy the Tomato Horde.[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
He turned around, and viciously hopin’[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
The grocery stores would still be open,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
His eyes grew cold, for he was a man,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                      [ch]D[/ch] 
Whose Moment of Truth lay close at hand.[/tab]

[Bridge 3]
[tab][ch]D7[/ch]
All over town, in every store, [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Tomatoes were hurt and spilled on the floor,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Big melons, and turkeys, and large sacks of grits,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                                 [ch]D[/ch]
Were dumped on their sections to mash them to bits.[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
At the last store he finished his plan,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
But on his way out, a delivery van,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
Full of big ripe Tomatoes drove in and hit him,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch] 
Tomato Vendetta had claimed its victim.[/tab]

[Bridge 4]
[tab][ch]D7[/ch]
The incident of the Tomato Vendetta,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Caused a sensation that was something that the[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Public could relish, and readily snatch-up,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Popularly known as the tomato ketchup… [/tab]

Artist: Matt Maeson
Song: Cringe
Genre: 
Key: 


Notes:
All chords are relative to the capo on the 5th fret in the studio version, 
but he also puts the capo on the 3rd or 4th in some live recordings

Matt plays the F as an Fmaj7 with an open high e (from low to high it's x33210), then a regular C chord,
into a G chord that is identical to an Fmaj7 but 2 frets up (x5543x), finishing with an Am7 played the way
it is usually played (x02010).

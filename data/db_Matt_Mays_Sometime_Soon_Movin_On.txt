For the rest of the song the chord progression is G, D, C, Am

you should be hitting the Am when he says "gotta get movin on"

I realize the unknown C's are a pain in the ass, but theyre really quite simple. Just
the C position and move from fret to fret, you should be able to pick it up quite

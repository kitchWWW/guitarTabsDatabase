[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I had a vision of the North Star[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]B[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]
She picked me up in her parents' car[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
We play the music we grew up on[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
We know every word to every song[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
I fell in love in one night[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
We'd talk it through and then we'd fight[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
It was over by the end of summer[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
I'll never be the same as who I was before I loved her[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
Cosmic superstar girl[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
So sick of the modern earth world[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                  [ch]B[/ch]
Dreams of better days and ways of living[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#m[/ch]
And she met a boy on the internet[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
It's been three weeks since she left me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]B[/ch]
Oh, how I hate the way I miss her[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I took her to the last train to the city[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                N.C.   [ch]E[/ch]
A minute to spare so we stood in silence[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I was headed to the cape[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
It was the end of a time in our lives[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
I knew that she'd never wait for me so I left us behind[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]B[/ch]
I let her lose me on highways in the dead of the night[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
Cosmic superstar girl[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
So sick of the modern earth world[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                  [ch]B[/ch]
Dreams of better days and ways of living[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#m[/ch]
And she met a boy on the internet[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
It's been three weeks since she left me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]B[/ch]
Oh, how I hate the way I miss her[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
Some nights change your whole heart in a minute[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
We were driving and I knew that if I blinked then I would miss it[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
It was fatal, there was nothing I could do except to live it[/tab]
    [ch]B[/ch]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
Some nights change your whole heart in a minute[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
We were driving and I knew that if I blinked then I would miss it[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
It was fatal, there was nothing I could do except to live it[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]
So I let you change everything[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
Some nights change your whole heart in a minute[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
We were driving and I knew that if I blinked then I would miss it[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]                                             N.C.
It was fatal, there was nothing I could do except to live it[/tab]

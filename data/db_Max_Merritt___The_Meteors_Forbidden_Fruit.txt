[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Eve and Adam had a garden, everything was great,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Until one day, a boy says "Pardon, and my name is Snake.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
See that apple over yonder, if you take a bite[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You and Adam are goin' to have, have some fun tonight"[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
The Lord had said in the beginning, "Everything is free,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
'Cept that apple leads to sinning, so let that apple be."[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
But Eve got tempted so she tried it, and as all chicks do,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Teased her man, so he decided, tried her apple too.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
C'mon and taste (forbidden fruit}[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
It's mighty sweet (forbidden fruit)[/tab]

       Alright[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I hate to tell you all what followed, the Lord was most upset[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Saw them making love and hollered, "What have you to add?"[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And when they made a full confession, the Lord said "Well I see,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Guess I'll have to teach you a lesson, about not minding me."[/tab]

[Chorus]

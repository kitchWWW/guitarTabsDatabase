[ch]Fm[/ch]

[ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]Ab[/ch]

[tab]             [ch]Fm[/ch] 
Through this world will you guide me [/tab]

Through this pain 
[tab]                        [ch]Ab[/ch]
Will you always hold my hand when I need you [/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]Fm[/ch]
When I don't know what I'm doing with myself [/tab]

I'm a lost soul 

Walking through this world 
[tab]            [ch]Ab[/ch]
Like I have some idea When I don't, I don't [/tab]

[tab]      [ch]Fm[/ch]
And I take on the baggage [/tab]

'Cause I think that I can 
[tab]      [ch]Ab[/ch]
And I wait for the right time [/tab]

To go with my plan 
[tab]    [ch]Fm[/ch]
And come to you [/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Ab[/ch]
And tell you how I feel [/tab]

[tab]             [ch]Db[/ch]
And when the morning comes [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Eb[/ch]                        [ch]Fm[/ch]
I will feel that I am brave again [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Db[/ch]
And when you pass me by[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Eb[/ch]                         [ch]Fm[/ch]
I will smile and then I'll walk away [/tab]


[ch]Fm[/ch]

[tab]           [ch]Fm[/ch]
I don't know what I'm doing [/tab]

I don't know where I'm going 
[tab]        [ch]Ab[/ch]
It just seems like there's something [/tab]

In the way that you are 
[tab]                [ch]Fm[/ch]
That makes me smile like a drunky [/tab]

Makes me high like a drug 
[tab]         [ch]Ab[/ch]
Makes me want to be near you [/tab]

Like I'm caught in this fog 

[tab]         [ch]Fm[/ch]
And I'll wait for tomorrow [/tab]

'Cause I know that I can 
[tab]         [ch]Ab[/ch]
And I'll wait [/tab]

Cause tomorrow I will go with my plan 
[tab]    [ch]Fm[/ch]
And come to you [/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Ab[/ch]
And tell you how feel [/tab]


[tab]             [ch]Db[/ch]
And when the morning comes [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Eb[/ch]                        [ch]Fm[/ch]
I will feel that I am brave again [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Db[/ch]
And when you pass me by[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Eb[/ch]                         [ch]Fm[/ch]
I will smile and then I'll walk away [/tab]

[tab]              [ch]Db[/ch]           [ch]Eb[/ch]           [ch]Fm[/ch]
And then I'll think of it, think of it [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Db[/ch]
And then I'll crave for it [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch]                  [ch]Fm[/ch]
And feel it all over again[/tab]

[ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]Ab[/ch]

[tab]             [ch]Db[/ch]
And when the morning comes [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Eb[/ch]                        [ch]Fm[/ch]
I will feel that I am brave again [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Db[/ch]
And when you pass me by[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Eb[/ch]                         [ch]Fm[/ch]
I will smile and then I'll walk away [/tab]

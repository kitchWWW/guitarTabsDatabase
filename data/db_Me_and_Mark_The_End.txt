Your voice on the line[/tab]

Played you a song
Wrote you a letter
To say that I'm done with this

Went through a box
Pictures of us smiling
Back of a room
Playing ourselves

We look so young
We look so happy
Don't really know if we ever were

And I don't believe
You're meant for me anymore
Than the shore
Belongs to the sea
And I was the one
And I was the only one
Standing for all
I knew you could be

Hello, you say 
It's been a long time
I can't 
Remember the last time we spoke

I'm good
I'm better
The winter's been hard on all of us
I'm getting close to letting go

Saw you in pictures
Heard you were doing so well
On your own now
I knew you would

Heard from a friend
Of a friend of a friend
You were moving out West
To give it a go

And I don't believe
You're meant for me anymore
Than the shore
Belongs to the sea
And I was the one
And I was the only one
Standing for all
I knew you could be

I miss you more than words can say

And I don't believe
You're meant for me anymore
Than the shore
Belongs to the sea
And I was the one
And I was the only one
Standing for all
I knew I could be

And the progress is pretty much the same the whole way. It's such a sweet song is 
easy as pie. have fun! :D

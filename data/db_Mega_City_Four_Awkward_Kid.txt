Artist: Mega City Four
Song: Awkward Kid
Genre: 
Key: 


For some reason there don't seem to be any tabs on the net for this great band
from the late 80s/early 90s, despite their having released 8 albums. Check out this 
song on Youtube and the rest of their discography on http://www.megacityfour.co.uk/
By the sounds of things a couple of their albums are set for re-release early 2013.

Here are the chords for this great song, any suggestions or comments, give me
a shout. Be gentle, this is my first tab here.

heroes in my school, never was a bigger fool.[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]Fm[/ch]
Sixteen came and went, nothing was different.[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
Important lessons passed me by. Well it [/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                        [ch]Em[/ch]
seemed that all my friends knew more, but how I never knew for sure.[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]Fm[/ch] 
Always last to get the punchline, left alone to think at lunchtime.[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I shut my mouth and prayed, that I would get it sometime.[/tab]


Chorus 1:

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]Fm[/ch]
Deep down I'm still an awkward kid, I'm not half the man I [/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]
thought that I'd grow up to be, I never solved the mystery.[/tab]

I thought I'd find out more, but I'm as lost as I ever was before.[/tab]

I'm as lost as I ever was before.[/tab]


Verse 2:

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch] 
Look a little harder, there's less than I can tell, you [/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch] 
may think that I'm smarter, but I've learned to act as well. In fact I'm lying, I just play a bit,[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
maybe one day I'll be really good at it.[/tab]

thought that I'd grow up to be, I never solved the mystery.[/tab]

When it's all said and done[/tab]


I watched from afar
Wishing on every star
Saving every penny
And I used to feel the same
Like everything's a game
But all I kept doing was losing


So hey, what are you going to say?
What are you going to do?
When it's all said and done


Hey, what are you going to say?
What are you going to do?
When it's all said
When it's all said and done

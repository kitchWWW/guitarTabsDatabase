[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
I thought I could touch you just for a moment[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
Then leave you before the feelin' got too strong[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
I had no idea you would feel so good[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Until I had gone too far[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
I should have known better it's happened before[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
But I swore the last time it won't happen any more[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
Now it's too late to turn back the damage is done[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
Oh I fooled around and fell in love[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Oh I fooled around and fell in love[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
And I swore I'd never do that again[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Oh I fooled around and fell in love[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Would you believe it I've done it again[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
There was someone before you and some in between[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
As far as I knew, you were just one more[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
I had no reason, to think you were different[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Until I had gone too far[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Now all of a sudden, I'm right where I started[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
Lost, in the land of the blue and broken hearted[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
For someone so cautious I'd sure acted dumb[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
To think I'd fooled around and fell in love[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Oh I fooled around and fell in love[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
And I swore I'd never do that again[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Oh I fooled around and fell in love[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Would you believe it I've done it again[/tab]

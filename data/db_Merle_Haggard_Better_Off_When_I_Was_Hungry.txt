[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
I read they're havin' rain in Cali- fornia[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
And Lord, I hope that you're not gettin' wet[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
That's the only way on earth I have for knowin' how you're doin'[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
When you left you said you call but you ain't yet[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
And I think I was better off when I was hungry[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]
And fightin' off the wolfs from our front door[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
But I wrote this song and it came on strong and left you once too often[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
Now I think I was better off when I was hungry[/tab]

My guitar brought us here to Bonmat Texas[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
And I bought you every- thing your eyes could see[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
But the mansion couldn't hold you could no- body's arms to warm you[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
I guess I gave you everything but me[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
And I think I was better off when I was hungry[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]
And fightin' off the wolfs from our front door[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
But I wrote this song and it came on strong and left you once too often[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
Now I think I was better off when I was hungry[/tab]

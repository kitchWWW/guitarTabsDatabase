[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
Dreamt of you last night[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Gm[/ch]
Woke up, you weren't there[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Gm[/ch]
Five nights in a row of dreams I've never shared[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
You come without a warning, early in the morning[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
Timing's never been our thing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Leaving me with guilt[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
The only souvenir you bring[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
I'm with him and you're a secret treasure[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]
He's devotion, you're a guilty pleasure[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
I'm with him and this is real life, honey[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
Guess the joke's no longer funny[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
I'm with him until the death do us part[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
But it doesn't do for this hungry heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
I'm with him, but in my frantic hеad[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Gm[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
You always come and say[/tab]


[Post-Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
Would you run away?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Gm[/ch]        [ch]Bb[/ch]
Would you run away with me?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
Would you run away?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Gm[/ch]       [ch]Bb[/ch]
Would you run away?[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Gm[/ch]
One lovе is enough, that's all you ever get[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
Least that's what they tell you[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Gm[/ch]
Still, I can't forget[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Eyes like burning ashes, 'til the sunlight flashes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
Chemical, but I've been taught[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]Dm[/ch]
Captivated by the thunderstorm in which I'm caught[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
I'm with him and you're a secret treasure[/tab]

I'm with him until the death do us part[/tab]

But it doesn't do for this hungry heart[/tab]

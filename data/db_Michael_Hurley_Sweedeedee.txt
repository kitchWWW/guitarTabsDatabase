[Verse]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]
My little woman causes me a whole lot of trouble sometimes[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]
She worries me so bad[/tab]

I don't know what to do
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
I take a walk[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]C[/ch]
Figure the rolling of my feet would come to ease my mind[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]
I'll just go away[/tab]

And I won't know
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]
Where I'm going[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]
And I won't know where[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]
That I am going to[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
Cause she bugger me[/tab]

She bugger me
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
Oh man, she'd bugger you[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]
I'm with you in the morning, baby[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
'till the break of day[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
I know you won't take my heart[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Tryin' to make me go away[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Seems like everybody[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Has got a little hard luck, sometime[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
And I know one thing for sure, baby[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
I've been having mine[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
Baby, I've been having mine[/tab]


We had one of them old fleabag apartments
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]
You know the kind I mean[/tab]

You walk up on the fifth floor there
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Sometimes on a sunny day from the roof[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
You can see them flying kites in Washington Square[/tab]

I go up on the roof and I watch her hanging up the clothes and I'd say to her:
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
"Wash the clothes, Sweedeedee[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
And hang 'em on the line[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
I can see by the way you wash the clothes[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Your cooking must be fine"[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
I'm with you in the morning, baby[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
'till the break of day[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]F[/ch]
Well, I know you don't want my heart[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
Tryin' to make me go away[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
Seems like everybody[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Got a little hard luck sometime[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]
And I know one thing for sure[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Baby, I've been having mine[/tab]

[tab]                                                              [ch]F[/ch]
I remember that old scumbag coffee shop we used to hang out at[/tab]

The manager there he'd let us stay without paying a cover
[tab]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
And I was always asking her sometime[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
We gotta leave the city[/tab]

And I'd say to her:
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]
"You wash them clothes, Sweedeedee[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
And hang 'em on the line[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]
And I can see by the way[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]

[tab]                           [ch]F[/ch]
I know you won't take my heart[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Don't make me go away[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Seem like everybody[/tab]

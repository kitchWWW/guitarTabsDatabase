[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
I have told you many times[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
That love is not a game[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]B[/ch]
And in your shame you promised[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
You would change your ways[/tab]

That was many years ago
And I was just a boy,
A toy that you could take up
When you felt the urge

[tab][ch]B[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
Tell me as you stand there looking down at me,[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
I want to know just exactly what you see,[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
As the sun goes down and midnight shadows fall,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]
I will think of you, will you remember me at all?[/tab]

Tell me, do I see a tear
That fell from solid stone?
I thought I was alone
Just talking to the wall

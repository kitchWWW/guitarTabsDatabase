[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
Tonight when he hands you the keys to the car[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                      [ch]C[/ch]
And he says, "You can drive, some, but don't drive too far"[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Tonight when she tells you you're her only one[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
Remember the morning brings on the sun[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
And they're watching you stumble and fall[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
Until you're lost down below like them all[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
Today when they give you their words of advice[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                 [ch]C[/ch]
And tell you you're free, friend, as long as it's nice[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
Today when their words of sweet wisdom come down[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]C[/ch]
Remember their smiles are hiding their frowns[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
And they're watching you stumble and fall[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
Until you're lost down below like them all[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
If you say you're their friend, I'm afraid you will learn[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                             [ch]C[/ch]
They want only friends they can have on their terms[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
But the love that you show them will give you an edge[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
For authority is more than wearing a badge[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
And you'll be watching them stumble and fall[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Until they're lost down below like them all[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Until they're lost down below like them all[/tab]

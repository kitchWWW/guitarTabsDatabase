[tab]Verse 1: [ch]C[/ch] [ch]E7[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]E7[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
I was unaware that you talked to god about me[/tab]
The more I think about that the more I think its what I need
So I'll say something charming but the language can't charm you
So I'll stay here sittin' on my hands


[tab][Chorus] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]E7[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]   [ending on [ch]F[/ch]]
With so much rubbing together I'm surprised theres not more sparks[/tab]
With a little bit more diggin' and I swear I'll reach your heart
When all thats left is darkness and your calling endlessly, call for me

Verse 2:
You said it was safe to leave our bikes by the street
You said its just as safe to leave the world down at my feet
Said even when your late I'll just say that I'm early
and I'll stay here sitting on my hands

[Chorus]
With so much rubbing together I'm surprised theres not more sparks
With a little bit more digging and I swear I'll reach your heart
When all thats left is darkness and your calling endlessly, call for me

Ooooo X4

With so much rubbing together I'm surprised theres not more sparks
With a little bit more digging and I swear I'll reach your heart
When all thats left is darkness and your calling endlessly
When all thats left is darkness and your callin out for me
When all thats left is darkness and your calling you keep calling, out to me

Ooooooo X2

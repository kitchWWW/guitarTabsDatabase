[Verse] 
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
You've been picking up this empty house washing your hands clean[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch] 
Of everything that has to do with me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
Except for the pillow and the sheets laying in the floor next to the bed[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
That never got any sleep[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
You can still feel last night inside your heart was breaking open wide[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
I can't stay with you as long as you want me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Stay with you even though I should[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
You listen to me when I tell you[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch] 
I said some things you misunderstood[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
You know that I don't want to hurt you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
I'm trying to make you see[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
I'll only stay with you long enough to leave[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch] 
I've been making a mess of what you gave me watching the exit signs[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
As they fly by they're keeping me from the truth[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Because I left an empty suitcase full promises I could never keep[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
That's more than I can do[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
And I can still hear the sound of your voice We both know I don't have a choice[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch] 
I can't stay with you as long as you want me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Stay with you even though I should[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]
Listen to me when I tell you[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
I said some things you misunderstood[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
You know that I don't want to hurt you[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
I'm trying to make you see[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
I'll only stay with you long enough to leave[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
You have to let me go for now[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
But hold on tight girl and I'll come back around[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
And I'll stay with you as long as you want me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Stay with you cause you know I should[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
You listen to me when I tell you[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
I said some things you misunderstood[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
You know that I don't want to hurt you[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
I'm trying to make you see[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
I'll only stay with you long enough to leave[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah, I'll only stay with you long enough to leave [/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
We spent more days fighting than we ever did loving[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
We could never see eye to eye[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
I worked and I slaved but I didn?t save[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
You spent every dime[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
Hell we could go out all day do whatever you want[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
You couldn?t be satisfied[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Man I wish I could buy some time[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Cause that girl wasted all of mine[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Hell I thought I was king and she was my queen[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
She hated my friends hell, we never did anything[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Her friends are phony they talk a lot[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
I come from home from work with nothing to do[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
But sit around here fighting with you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Where you chew my ass, I kept it all inside[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
I got so far in debt it took all my checks[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Till I could realize[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]C[/ch]
She wanted everything like that big diamond ring[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
And a couple of men on the side[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
She took all of my bad habits threw them out the door[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Luckily I told my friend next door[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Now we sit around until our brains are fried[/tab]

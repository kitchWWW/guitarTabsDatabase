[ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]C[/ch] 
Stormy weather, here we go again[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
We don't talk about it and you never change nothing[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
It doesn't matter that's what lovers do[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
We don't run from it when the skies are blue[/tab]

Bridge:
[tab][ch]F[/ch] 
So you can be the thunder and I can be the rain[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Let love pull us under and do it all again[/tab]

Chorus:
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
And I said Blame it on the weather and the things it makes us do[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
We could blame it on each other for we know we're guilty too[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
And I said Hear my song[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
It won't last too long[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
and we'll blame it all on the weather[/tab]


Bitter winter, victims of the storm
I'm not freezing over it makes me love you more lover
I adore you, nothing more to say
If it wasn't for you I'd never love this way

Bridge:
So you can be the thunder and I can be the rain
Oh Let love pull us under and do it all again

Chorus:
So I said Blame it on the weather and the things it makes us do
We could blame it on each other for we know we're guilty too
And I said Hear my song
It won't last too long
and we'll blame it all on the weather    x2

oooh ooooh

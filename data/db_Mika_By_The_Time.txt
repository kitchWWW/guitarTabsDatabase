Put a capo on 5 if you want to play along to the track, but if you're just 
singin' with your guitar... I found this a much easier tone to sing to XD

[Intro]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                        [ch]Em[/ch]
Don't wake up, won't wake up, can't wake up, no, don't wake me up[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                        [ch]Em[/ch]
Don't wake up, won't wake up, can't wake up, no, don't wake me up[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
It's the early morn'[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F[/ch]
Lights flick on  [/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
Sleepy eyes peek through the blinds at something wrong[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
Motionless remains the mess[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Shame, such a beautiful, beautiful, young life[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]Am[/ch]
   By the time I'm dreaming, and you've crept out on me sleeping[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
I'm busy in the blissful unaware[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]Am[/ch]
By the time I'm dreaming, and you've crept out on me sleeping[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
Tell me, how am I supposed to care?[/tab]

[Interlude]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                        [ch]Em[/ch]
Don't wake up, won't wake up, can't wake up, no, don't wake me up[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                        [ch]Em[/ch]
Don't wake up, won't wake up, can't wake up, no, don't wake me up[/tab]


Then repeat the another verse


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]Am[/ch]
   By the time I'm dreaming, and you've crept out on me sleeping[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
I'm busy in the blissful unaware[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]Am[/ch]
By the time I'm dreaming, and you've crept out on me sleeping[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
Tell me, how am I supposed to care?[/tab]


After the second chorus, the bridge starts. Only I couldn't really 
figure that one out. I hope someone will.

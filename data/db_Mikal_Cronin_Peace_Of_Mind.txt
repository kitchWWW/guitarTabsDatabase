A few notes on the tab:
1. Some of the Gs (including the ones in line 2 and 4 of the chorus but there are 
others) sound good if they are played as Em.
2. A lot of the chords have varying progressions while playing them. For example, most 
of the D chords follow a D, Dsus4, D, Dsus2 pattern and there are similar things going on 
for other chords as well.
3. He plays mostly with barre chords but it still sounds good if you don't.
4. The notes for the outro aren't exactly right but I can't be bothered figuring them out.

From his window he watches as people, come and go on their way.[/tab]
[tab]                                                             [ch]C[/ch]
Rushin to catch the train homewards, as he often did in his day.[/tab]
[tab]                                                                  [ch]G[/ch]
He remembers the dark of the mornings, the days he worked in the rain.[/tab]
[tab]                                                         [ch]G7[/ch]
the good times the bad times the friends that the knew, he'll never see them [/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
again.[/tab]
[tab]                                                                  [ch]G[/ch]
At night when the streets are deserted, except for the take away signs[/tab]

he thinks of the men that he worked with, on the buildings the roads and the 
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
mines[/tab]
[tab]                                                                      [ch]G[/ch]
the girl that he met in the galtee, he thought he might make her his own.[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]G7[/ch]
Maybe if there was less drinkin', he wouldn't have wound up alone.[/tab]



Chorus
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                                      [ch]C[/ch]
P is for powerful when put to the test, A is for always doin' your best,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
D is for doin' if it can be done, and D is for drinkin' when work it is done[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
Y is for yearnin' to see home again, proud to be Irish and hard workin' men[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                                   [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]G7[/ch]
Paddy remember though your day is done, you're the rock that England stands [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
on.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                                       [ch]G[/ch]
He never explained just what happened, the years seemed to pass like a day,[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]G7[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
Was it the rain or the shovel, took the strength from his limbs away.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                                  [ch]G[/ch]
Sometimes he thinks of the boreen, that led from his house to the lane.[/tab]
[tab]                                                [ch]G7[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
And the fields that he worked with his father, he'll never see them again.[/tab]

As he makes his way back to the shelter, rain starts to fall on the ground[/tab]
[tab]                                                                [ch]D[/ch]
A young man just in from Cork City, asks him where work can be found.[/tab]
[tab]                                                                   [ch]A[/ch]
He said "son take a long look at Paddy, and remember what ever you do,[/tab]
[tab]                                                                       [ch]D[/ch]
This broken old man that you're seein, was once a young man just like you"[/tab]

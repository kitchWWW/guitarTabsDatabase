"Miles Away"
Covered by Mike Herrera here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN4KFXNzfvg
Originally by Goldfinger
Chorded by swaid
and enjoyed by you!

Tune half step down
Except for the E, everything is barre chords (which i guess the E technically is as well)
For the last set of chords/outro, mike is adding an F# on low E while keeping the B chord, 
repeatedly moving F# on and off slowly

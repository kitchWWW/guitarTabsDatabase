Key: 


"Moments Like This"
by Mike Hererra
Album "Moments like These: Texas"
chorded by swaid
and enjoyed by you

Tuning is to Eb.  The chords below are written in their normal shape, so when it says E, since you are tuned
to Eb, it will really be Eb.  They are relative to the neck position.  For this song, he's rarely strumming
the entire chords.  He strums them occasionally and individually plays notes most of the time in a very
slow strum, so it may take him all the way until the next chord to hit all 6 strings.
Upon listening to the album, I'm convinced that Mike stays tuned to Eb and plays most of his songs
with a capo on 2, because there's not enough of a tuning pause or guitar swap pause between the songs.  There
is no capo on this song.

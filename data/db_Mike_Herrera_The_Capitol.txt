"The Capitol"
by Mike Hererra
Album "Moments Like These: Texas"
chorded by swaid
and enjoyed by you

If you play this in standard tuning, put the capo on 1.  

Every song I've seen mike play live on youtube is in 1/2 step down tuning.  If you listen to this album, you 
can tell there isn't time to retunes or guitar swaps between songs.  With that said, tune 1/2 step down and 
put a capo on 2 if you want it to be 100% identical to the way Mike plays it.

this D#maj7 is different than normal.  it's the C shape but up with the A string on D#maj7, relative to the capo

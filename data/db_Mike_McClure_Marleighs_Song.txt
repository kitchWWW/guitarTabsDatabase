[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                            [ch]A[/ch]
I used to live in a world where I let nobody in[/tab]
[tab][ch]B7[/ch]                                         [ch]E[/ch]
Then there was you and you gave my heart a spin[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]                                                                [ch]A[/ch]
Now it flies around the sun sometimes and around the moon every now and then[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]B7[/ch]                                                        [ch]E[/ch]
And I would gladly bring them down for you if I thought it'd make you grin[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
But tonight you're sleeping there with your mama[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                     [ch]E[/ch]
and your daddy's all alone in a hotel room[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                                                     [ch]E[/ch]
But I've got your picture and just remember, I'll be coming back home soon[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]B7[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
Goodnight my angel and goodnight moon[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                             [ch]A[/ch]
I like the way that your hair dangles in your eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]B7[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
Deeper blues I've never known, bluer than Montana skies[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                                   [ch]A[/ch]
And sometimes I wonder if you'll ever wonder like a do[/tab]
[tab][ch]B7[/ch]                                                         [ch]E[/ch]
Either way I'll be your partner for as long as you want me to[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
But tonight you're sleeping there with your mama[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                     [ch]E[/ch]
and your daddy's all alone in a bar In Red Level[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                                                     [ch]E[/ch]
But I've got your picture and just remember, I'll be coming back home soon[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]B7[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
Goodnight my angel and goodnight moon[/tab]

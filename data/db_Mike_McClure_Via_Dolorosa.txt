Via Dolorosa
Mike Mcclure

[Intro]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Angel circlin' the heavens[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]A[/ch]
thoughts drift by on silver clouds[/tab]

a weathered crack deep in the sidewalk
[tab]                                [ch]A[/ch]
from too much hustle, too much crowd[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
there's too much time left on my hands[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
there's too much heartache in my soul[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]D[/ch]      
there's too much hangin' round this pay-phone[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
there's too much loss of self-control[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]
and i guess your love is like nails[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
so you can crucify me[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]
and lay down upon your rails[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]D[/ch]
so you could locomotive over me[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
yeah you stone me when i stumble[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]D[/ch]
and thorns are woven in your talk[/tab]
 
and i come with you as always
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
down the via dolorosa when i walk[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
i walk[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
my demons come around with the sundown[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]A[/ch]
and they dance their circles in my head[/tab]

and how they twirl your memory all around
[tab]                             [ch]A[/ch]
and lay you down on burning beds[/tab]

i pity you my saving angel
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
i wish i may, i wish i might[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
have you saved your last prayer for me[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
wherever god has you tonight[/tab]

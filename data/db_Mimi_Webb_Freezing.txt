[Intro]
[ch]E5[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
(Hey)[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                     [ch]C#m7[/ch]
You told me everything to make me stay[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]B[/ch]
You told me everybody makes mistakes[/tab]

And it was over I guess
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
But I was still in your bed[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]E[/ch]
Thought I could keep you as a "just in case"[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]C#m7[/ch]
You only call me when you know I'm out[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]B[/ch]
Or when there's no one that you know around[/tab]

You should pretend that I'm dead
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]E[/ch] N.C.
Because sometimes you forget that we're not together[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Count to three[/tab]

You'd better believe
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]
I've shut that door[/tab]

And swallowed the keys
[tab]   [ch]B[/ch]                                            [ch]E[/ch]
I said that we'd chill, then I ran for the hills[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]E[/ch]
If that was cold, then now I'm freezing[/tab]

[tab]                          [ch]F#m[/ch]
Woke up and saw I was bleedin'[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C#m[/ch]
Promise I'm done and now I really mean it[/tab]
[tab] [ch]B[/ch]
Abandoning ship[/tab]

You're not gettin' the hint
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
Said it was over, I was leavin'[/tab]

If that was cold, then now I'm freezing

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
(Hey)[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                     [ch]C#m[/ch]
I thought that you would be my getaway[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]
I thought that you would be my end game[/tab]

But you were just like the rest
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                                         [ch]E[/ch] [ch]C#m7[/ch]
Couldn't help make a mess when we said we're not together[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]C#m[/ch]
Go get gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]
Go and find someone[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
Forget us[/tab]
 N.C.
Us

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Count to three[/tab]

You'd better believe
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]       [ch]C#m7[/ch]
I've shut that door[/tab]

[tab]                                   [ch]C#m7[/ch]
Oh, you'd better, you'd better believe it[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#m[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]
When I'm gone I'm gone, and I mean it[/tab]

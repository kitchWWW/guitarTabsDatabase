So, the plane fell down and the pilot never got to see[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]Am[/ch]
the hero he became on international TV[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                              [ch]Am[/ch] 
and even though the photo shown looked kind of old[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]Am[/ch]
the story of his life was beautifully told[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
when he was young he used to smile at everyone[/tab]

now he’s gone

[ch]C[/ch] - [ch]Am[/ch] - [ch]C[/ch] - [ch]Am[/ch]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]Am[/ch]
And even though he’s no part of your life[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                   [ch]Am[/ch]
there’s a feeling of loss that you just can’t put aside[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                              [ch]Am[/ch]
then at one point you forget how to spell his name[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                         [ch]Am[/ch]
and what breaks your heart, is how you manage to stay the same[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
when he was young he used to smile at everyone[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
now he’s gone [/tab]

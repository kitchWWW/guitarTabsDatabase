 If I could be anyone for one day[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I'd be a guy who gets his hair to stay[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Cadd9[/ch]            [ch]Em7[/ch]
And I would just walk around the mall[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
And be the coolest one of all, I'd[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]             Cadd
 I'd buy some girl clothes, and maybe I would[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]            [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
 I'd pierce my own nose, And I could just[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Cadd9[/ch]                              [ch]Em7[/ch]
So that I could have the tightest hair and jeans so,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Maybe I would catch your eye[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
I'd buy out every vintage store[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
If it would mean you would like me more[/tab]

That's why I wish that I had red hair with some white[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Em7[/ch]               [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
And maybe I could dye it blue-black in one night[/tab]

And I could tell you that you mean more than life itself[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Because it couldn't come from someone else[/tab]

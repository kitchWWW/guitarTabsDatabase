[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
Maybe I'm wrong you decide[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
Should've been strong, yeah I lied[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]
Nobody gets me like you[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
Couldn't keep hold of you then[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
How could I know what you meant[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]
There was nothing to compare to[/tab]
       
                                                                 
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
There's a mountain between us[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
But there's one thing I'm sure of[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]
That I know how I feel about you[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Can we bring yesterday back around[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
Cause I know how I feel about you now[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
But I know how I feel about you now[/tab]


Repeat what you did for the first verse & chorus.


All that it takes one more chance
Don't let our last kiss be our last
Give me tonight and I'll show you

      
I know everything changes
I don't care where it takes us
But I know how I feel about you

   
Can we bring yesterday back around
Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Not a day passed me by[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]
Not a day passed me by[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]
When I don't think about you[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]
And there's no moving on [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
Cause I know you're the one[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]
And I can't be without you[/tab]


Can we bring yesterday back around
Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

Can we bring yesterday back around
Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
But I know how I feel about you now[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
Yea I know how I feel about you now[/tab]

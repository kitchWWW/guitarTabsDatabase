[tab]                  [ch]F#[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]
Ain't you baby[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F#[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]
You're kinda crazy[/tab]

Verse 2: My reputation follows me around
Just makes me want to give 'em more to talk about
Let's go to town for a little while
I'll be wearin' nothin' but a tattoo and a smile

Chorus: Ain't no use in tryin' to slow me down
'Cause you're runnin' with the fastest girl in town
Ain't you baby
You're kinda crazy

(Instrumental, repeat verse chords)
Come on

Verse 3: I see the blue lights, we better run
Throw out the bottle, I'll hide the gun
If he pulls us over, I'll turn on the charm
You'll be in the slammer and I'll be on his arm

Chorus: Ain't no use in tryin' to slow me down
'Cause you're runnin' with the fastest girl in town
Ain't you baby
Well I told you I was crazy
No I ain't nobody's baby

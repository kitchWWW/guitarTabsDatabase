[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
You put your hand on top of mine[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
you're talking fast but talking blind[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
and I can't bring myself to meet your eyes[/tab]



[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
'cos death is slowly covering you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
in galaxies of black and blue[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
and under your skin all his colors bloom[/tab]



[tab]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
And you're only half here[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
like someone left a frail body and took the rest[/tab]



[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]Dm[/ch]        
But I remember when you were strong[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]
never wanted help from no-one[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch], [ch]Dm[/ch], [ch]G[/ch]
what you've become is not who I remember[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]C[/ch], [ch]Dm[/ch], [ch]Em[/ch], [ch]F[/ch], [ch]G[/ch]
Is this the cooling of the embers?[/tab]



[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
She's back again through summers past[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
the smell of rain and freshly cut grass[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
seems those ordinary days are the ones that last[/tab]



[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Cos he was there, the one you loved[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
the one you never could let go of[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
and there's something you know as you're looking up[/tab]



[tab]                [ch]Dm[/ch]
That your only half here[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
like someone left a frail body and stole the rest[/tab]




[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]Dm[/ch]        
But I remember when you were strong[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]
never wanted help from no-one[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch], [ch]Dm[/ch], [ch]Em[/ch]
what you've become is not who I remember[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch], [ch]Dm[/ch], [ch]Em[/ch], [ch]F[/ch], [ch]G[/ch], [ch]Am[/ch], [ch]F[/ch]. [ch]G[/ch]
Is this the cooling of the embers?[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
is this the cooling of the embers?[/tab]



[tab][ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
Cos you are not who I remember[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
it's like you are a child, you are a child, you are a child once more[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
and all of our yesterday's have gone[/tab]



[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
You put your hand on top of mine[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
you're talking fast but talking blind[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
and I can't bring myself to meet your eyes...[/tab]

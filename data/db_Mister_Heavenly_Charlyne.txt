Song: Charlyne
Genre:

Don't know what key the recording is in (and don't really want to check right now), so 
I'm putting it in G.

[tab][ch]F[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] x2 [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
Behind every single heartbeat[/tab]
is another unsung malady
You don't know, but you hum along like you do
Play the fool

[tab][ch]F[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] x3 [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
You thought you could learn to love me and rule me[/tab]
and hide all your sorrows in a Harley
and get all your kicks off acting crazy
When push comes to love,
you just ain't strong enough to let it go

[tab][ch]F[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
Before you know it,[/tab]
you're wrapped up in her web
[tab][ch]F[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
Before you know it,[/tab]
you're way in over your head
[tab][ch]F[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
Before you know it,[/tab]
you're finally in her bed

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
In the middle of the night,[/tab]
in the middle of the street,
and you tear your hair
and you burn your sheets
Screaming

[tab][ch]F[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] x4 [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
Charlyne, Charlyne! (x4)[/tab]
and I always play the fool for Charlyne

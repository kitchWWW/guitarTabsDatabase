[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I still, I still care about you[/tab]
My front teeth fell out without you
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
 We shared mattresses and cried to 1991 when you flew[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 I think we might still get along in[/tab]
Small doses when we're alone, but
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
 We haven't spoke since last December[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
I think we might be waiting for a better day[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
Better day[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Better day[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 Six years older, you feel younger[/tab]
I fell off and you fell under
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
 Closer when we're far apart like[/tab]
Milky Ways and hazy stars, but
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 I think we might still get along if[/tab]
We both find where we belong and
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
 Operate in different spaces[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]C[/ch]
Until we find our way into a better day[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Better day, better day, better day[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]   [ch]Dm7[/ch]           [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Ooh, I like to party[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I know you do too[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I'll meet you on the moon with my red shoes on[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
And maybe we could contemplate[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
How you and I could formulate[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am7[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
A greater way to find a way to better days (Better days, better days)[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Cm[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
To find a way to (Better days, better days, better days)[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
To find our way to (Better days, better days, better days)[/tab]
Hey, oh, ah

[Outro]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 I care, I care about you[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
 Still love, still love, still love you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
 I'll wait, I'll wait to find a better day[/tab]

It was 2004 I was sweet 16[/tab]

driving through north west too
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]                          [ch]Em7[/ch]
On your 125 on the duel carriageway [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Gsus2[/ch]      [ch]G/F#[/ch]
with the wind in my face[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
you would pick me up every saturday[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
you would always be late[/tab]

but I was willing to wait for you
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I didn't know at the time[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]
that 5 years down the line [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Gsus2[/ch]         [ch]G/F#[/ch]

Verse2:(Same as verse 1)
2006 I just turned 18
I'm startin to grow up now
had enough of your shit
said it's time for a change
said you were feelin the same
you commited and gave me the love I craved
you were so hard to trust
after all that you put me through
but when I gave you the chance 
I really thought it would last
We were so in love

[tab]  [ch]Dsus2[/ch]

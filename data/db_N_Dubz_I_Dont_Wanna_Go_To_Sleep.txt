Verse 2:(same as verse 1)
Watch me shine like a star
step in the club
like you know who we are
drink a few, thats my fuse to take over this place
the spotlights on my face
all the boys wanna taste
so they can take a look but don't touch, don't touch
Ladies watch but don't hate, don't hate
I came to get smashed
I dont wanna go to sleep i just wanna stay awake

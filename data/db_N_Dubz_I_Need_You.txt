Verse:
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                         
Last night was a blur, but all I remember is[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]   
 Black shirt, bare carats on my wrist[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Me and a couple men rollin' up in a whip[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
Met a pretty young lady, should I say...[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch] 
Will I ever see you again[/tab]

Always thinkin' of another man's riches
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
 Why do you do this to us men[/tab]

And that's why we call them bitches
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
See I don't understand, she wasn't with a man[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
How could I leave without a number in my hand[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I went to go on Facebook, will I get a face back[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Trying to find you is like a needle in a haystack[/tab]



Pre chorus:
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
I came so close, you touched my body[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]
You left me standing like a statue, baby I need you[/tab]



Chorus:
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
I was missing yesterday[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
I never took your number[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Now you're nowhere to be found[/tab]

I'm going mad, I need you
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
I been searchin' all over Facebook,[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
and I can't seem to find you[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
I really have to find you,[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
baby I need you, you, you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]
I need ya[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
I need you, you, you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
I need ya[/tab]

Oh oh, oh, oh oh


Verse 2(same as verse 1)
Last night I met a fella he made me feel so, oh oh oh
That can mean what you want it to mean
Popped to the ladies for a sec (Uh, I'll be back in five, yeh?)
But when I came back out he left (I felt so alone)
He left me standing in my LBD and my bang bang shoes
I was so confused


Pre Chorus:
I came so close, you touched my body
You left me standing like a statue, baby I need you



Chorus:
I was missing yesterday
I never took your number
Now you're nowhere to be found
I'm going mad, I need you
I've been searchin' all over Facebook,
and I can't seem to find you
I really have to find you, baby I need you



Bridge:
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]
See now I gotta find someone like you[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
You ain't gonna find no one like me[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]G[/ch]
Someone tell me what the hell I should do[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]
Will I ever find someone just like you (I don't think so)[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]
Not quite like me[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Girl, you're one in a million (I'm one in a million)[/tab]


Verse 3(same as verse 1)
Yo, what do I do I need to find you girl
'Cos you could be the one to make a change in my world
Maybe one day I'll put a ring around your finger
You should try bein' with a singer
And do you know the meaning of a stark in jail
Until we meet again, my heart's on mail
Wherever you are right now, I just wanna know that



Last Chorus:
You're my love
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
I was missing yesterday[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
I never took your number[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Now you're nowhere to be found[/tab]

I'm going mad, I need you
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
I been searchin' all over Facebook,[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
and I can't seem to find you[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
I really have to find you, baby I need you[/tab]

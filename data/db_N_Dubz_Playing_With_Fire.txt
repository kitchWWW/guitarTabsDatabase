One big smile on my face d-d-darling it's just you and me[/tab]

Now I'm on some Alfie behaviour I'll call you back later, too many fish in the sea for me [/tab]

But when the lights come on and what's her name is gone I realise where I'm supposed to be [/tab]

I tried to believe every word of your sweet story [/tab]
[tab]                                                [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
But intuition keeps telling me,  You're making a fool outta me[/tab]

Chorus
[tab]                                         [ch]Bb[/ch]
Cause I'm such a good liar [/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Just admit it, I never did it [/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch] 
Yes you did , No I didn't[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Bb[/ch] 
I'm playing with fire [/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Just admit it, I never did it I know you did it [/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
No I didn't (yes you did) [/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]Bb[/ch]
Cause I'm such a good liar [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Oooh[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                                                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
I can't help myself I keep playing with fire [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch]
Ohhh[/tab]


Verse 2 (As before)
Thoughts running wild through the night as I watch you sleep 
I can't help but check his texts while he's passed out next to me  
I'm on some CSI behaviour, who's gonna save ya 
You'll be the fool when the truth comes out
But when those lights come on and what's her face is gone 
we're straight back to the same routine 

I tried to believe every word of your sweet story 
But intuition keeps telling me 
You're making a fool outta me

Chorus (As before)
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                                                                              
Living life in disguise, can't keep up with these lies [/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
She'd do anything to try and catch me out, but I never leave no signs [/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
In my heart we were meant to be, guys like me we be like 2 or 3 [/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
I can't help myself I love girls [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                [ch]Bb[/ch]      [ch]Dm[/ch]
I get a kick out of playing with fire,                [/tab]
[tab]                                                           [ch]C[/ch]
 I get a kick out of playing with fire [/tab]
Playing with fire, playing with fire

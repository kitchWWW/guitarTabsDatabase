Verse 2(Same as verse 1)
I ain't gunna lie you were number one then
But it just ain't the same anymore your out of my top ten
This ain't good for your health and if only you knew
That every time i'm fuckin you I think of somebody else 
I knew that one of us were gunna get hurt from the get go
I told you, I told you I said so 
I hate, havin to fake, the feelin every time that we get low
I think it's better for the both of us if we let go
She wonders why i'm never round these days
as soon as I touch base she'll be all up in my face
it's the same old shit she never gives me any space
how do tell her someone's taken her place

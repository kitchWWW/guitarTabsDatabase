[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]

Verse 2(same as verse 1)
something let me tell u bout something, 
recognise u cant tell me nothin but one thing boy u got my blood pumpin, 
i'm ragin at u, u got me so damn angry, 
ur selfish and ruthless so useless excuses mean nothing 2 me, 
this child is a part of me, 
you cant begin to understand so while its living and growing inside, 
but you're just a man, you don't understand, 
Get outta my get outta my get outta my face my face my face.


CHORUS


Bridge:
[tab]  [ch]Bb[/ch]                          [ch]Dm[/ch]
I feel for you but u knew the deal[/tab]

(you was lying wen u said u was on the pill)
[tab]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
I have to be real with you[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Dm[/ch]                                      [ch]C[/ch]

Im afraid i cant be involved, 

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]Dm[/ch]
It's just the same old selfishness with you[/tab]

Don't pretend your understanding
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]

 [ch]A[/ch] regular [ch]Em[/ch])

Chorus:

[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]              [ch]Bm7[/ch]
Hey there mister give me some cash[/tab]

[tab] [ch]Am7[/ch]                   [ch]Bm7[/ch]
I'm high as heck and I'm ready to blast[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                [ch]Bm7[/ch]
I'm just one hit away from being passed out[/tab]
 
[tab] [ch]C#m7[/ch]
Young and assed out[/tab]


And that's the whole song..

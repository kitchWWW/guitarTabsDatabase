Key: 




"Breakout"


This is my first tab.  
I couldn't match the other tab to the tune
so I had a go myself. 

I think the verse and hook are alright. 
Not too sure sure about the chorus, but that's what the bassline is,
so I just followed it from that and it sounds ok.  

You can fingerpick the verse with the chords.

[verse]
All you can be is just you cause
You're real not the plastic type.
But reality sets and
You're stuck in this plastic life.


[Hook]
Why the tears
We are here for you
But I know how you feel, I know how you feel
When nothing cares.

[Chorus]

[Break out]

Hey!
Shit happens, hey, just blow it off, whooo,
Man, don't it make you feel rage, rage, yeah
Hey!
Shit happens, u-uh, just blow it off, whooo,
Man, don't it make you feel rage ,rage ,yeah
Just aslong we got the same thing in our veins,
You and I ,we are both the same
I bail you out and show you what you see
'bout love, N*E*R*D, peace


You get the idea.

Let me know for any improvements, because it's not perfect, cheers

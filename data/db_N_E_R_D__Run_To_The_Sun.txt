Song: Run To The Sun
Genre: 
Key: 


that's easy,  there are four different chords, [ch]D[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]F#m[/ch] throughout the whole son 
then [ch]C#m[/ch] just before the final chorus.

[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                                         
Thinking about the time we shared[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]
And how I wasn't there[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#m[/ch]           
It hurt me, these people overworked me[/tab]



keep on with this chords throughout the song then at the end:


[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
S.O.S. to your ears[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                                    [ch]C#m[/ch]
The only thing I ever feared was this day[/tab]

And having to say


that's all, for an acoustic version this sounds good, hope you'll enjoy it
cheers

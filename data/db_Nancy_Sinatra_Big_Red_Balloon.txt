Big Red Balloon

[tab]Intro: [ch]A[/ch]
Sometimes a man and a woman spend 30 or 40 years together[/tab]
and they don't belong together
And then one day one of them tries to leave and does
but in a most peculiar way

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Woman, one of these days I'm leaving, leaving you far behind.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
And on that day you'll be grieving, grieve on woman, I don't mind.[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
Look out in the backyard, mama, cause I'm leaving you real soon.[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Gonna fly me up to heaven in my big red balloon.[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
You're nothing but an old fool, and that's all you'll ever be.[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
You're nothing but an old fool, you know you'll never beat me.[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
So stop your silly playing, it's time you settled down.[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]                                        [ch]A[/ch]
And hear me when I'm saying: You'll never get that damn thing off the ground.[/tab]

Oh, woman, are you looking cause I'm almost 10 feet high, high, high.
Woman, stop your cooking cause I'll never eat that pie.
I'm on my way to heaven, might even touch the moon.
Wave me goodbye, I'm leaving in my big red balloon.

You're nothing but an old fool..

You never gave me nothing, you never were the kind.
You never gave me children, you never had the time.
Remember me to no one, I was born this afternoon.
I got it all together in my big red balloon.

You're nothing but an old fool...

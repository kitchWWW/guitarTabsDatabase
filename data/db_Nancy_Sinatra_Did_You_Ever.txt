Well I just wonder, did you ever? All the time[/tab]

Could I fix you once more? No thanks I just had one
Then how about a nice big... That will just be fine
Is there any special way? No, whatever you say
Well I just wonder, did you ever? All the time

Does he look like... No he’s taller and more handsome
Yeah but he is old? Oh no he’s young and he’s in his prime
Does your father know of it? Hmm. Hmm.. I haven’t told him yet
I just wonder, did you ever? All the time

But just for all time sake. That will be much harder
Then how about. Well are you sure you don’t mind
I know just thing for us. I’m afraid I’ll miss my bus
I just wonder, did you ever? All the time

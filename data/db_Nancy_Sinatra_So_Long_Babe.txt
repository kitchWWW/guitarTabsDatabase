I know you're leaving babe goodbye and so long
Pick up the pieces and go back where you belong
You gave them all you had what did they gave to you?
They gave you nothing babe so give them nothing too
So long babe, so long babe, so long babe
So long babe, so long babe

I know you're leaving babe goodbye and so long
You never made it, babe, I wonder what went wrong
They never understood your songs here’s just what you do
Just walk away and leave them let them come to you
So long babe, so long babe, so long babe
So long babe, so long babe

Intro (riff x1)

Verse 1 (riff x2)                 
As it was in the beginning                        
So it will be in the end                            
You have to keep on guessing                           
The world will never change
                           
I’m sending you a message                        
From a million miles away                               
Are you aware you are controlled                      
By forces still unknown

Chorus (strummed chords)
F#       A  E (x2)
F#                     
There will be no sunset
A                E        
When the rain is falling
F#                           
It’s hard to hear thunder
A                    E        
When the river keeps roaring
F#                       
Then one day it’s over
A             E         
Like it never happened
D              C#m       F#                        
Disappear without a trace
D      C#m         (straight into verse 2)    
On Independence Day

Verse 2 (riff x2)                     
We are use to thinking                           
Our plans were set in stone                         
You're giving me an update                               
You think every one has to know
                          
I guess I am an accomplice                       
To the true original sin                            
So let me take your suffering                
Let me take you in

Chorus   
F#       A  E (x2)                   
F#                     
There will be no sunset
A                E        
When the rain is falling
F#                           
It’s hard to hear thunder
A                    E        
When the river keeps roaring
F#                       
Then one day it’s over
A             E         
Like it never happened
D              C#m       F#                         
Disappear without a trace
D      C#m      B 
On Independence Day
D              C#m       F#                       
Disappear without a trace
D              C#m       F#  (end cold)                  
On Independence Day

Notes:
The first chord is tricky to finger, but otherwise the riff is fairly straightforward and I think is accurate
to how it was played (from the infinity sessions video and the recording).  It was doubled on the recording.
There are some variations I have not included - mainly places where the 1st or 3rd string is played in place 
of the second as the 4th or 8th note in the phrase.

You may wish to play a Eb bass note in bar 8 - as in bar 4 - to make the chord change to bar 1 easier.  
However, I am fairly sure that this is not what was actually played - in particular, refer to a "warm up" 
version of the riff played at 3:06:30 of week 4 of the infinity sessions:

KING TIDE
(Neil Finn/Robert Moore)

NOTES:  I have no chords or tab noted for the first verse; with 
all the weirdness going on with the keyboard part (is it two 
keyboards?), I couldn't nail down a definite part, so nothing is 
noted here. 


VERSE:
It's a dark and empty room
the sun beating hard on your door
I feel emotion roar within you
you're flesh and blood like anyone


VERSE:

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]C7[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
Make some sense of your life[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]C7[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
move your hand and make the mark[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]C7[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
I don't know why you're so confused[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
you're flesh and blood, there's no excuse[/tab]

CHORUS:

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
And the hunger inside[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
won't go away, it's starting to rise[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
and the longer you hide[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
the more you deny[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
and the sea rushes in[/tab]


VERSE:
The wind is howling at your back
the past is always overturned
it's a dead man who would refuse
and twice the man to fill his shoes

CHORUS:
And the hunger inside
won't go away, it's starting to rise
and the longer you hide
the more you deny
and the hunger inside
it won't go away, it's starting to rise

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch] 
and the sea rushes in[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
into my world[/tab]


[REPEAT SOLO ABOVE W/ VARIATION]


[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I can feel a king tide coming[/tab]
all my senses overflowing
one of them waiting out the back
horns blowing, cymbals crash
so paint a circle in the sky
I was reckless in the arms of love
there's a bruise on my back
and a new understanding too

[ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]

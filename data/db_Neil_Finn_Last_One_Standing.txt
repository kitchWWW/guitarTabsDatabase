If you want you can get there

landing in your treasure towers
and I promise that I won't look back
everyday I'm making ground
so high I might as well be gone

And you are magnificent
and I can see you with my eyes closed
when you're walking into my house
I'll be the last one standing
and you are magnificent
I can see you with my eyes closed
when you're walking into my house
I'll be the last one standing

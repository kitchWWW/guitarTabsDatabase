INTRO:  B(VII)    A(V)


VERSE:
E*
Remember my loose tongue

D6*
forget what I just said

E
I'd crawl over broken glass

D6
if we could start again

E
before our plans were made

D6
when the world was young

E
the house is falling down

D6
because of my loose tongue


VERSE:
Shouldn't say so much
shouldn't talk so loud
No sooner on your lips
then it's all over town
in all our given days
how many gone to waste
a good man has been hung
because of my loose tongue


BRIDGE:  Em
                           G
Your skin is changing it's hue

                        Em
your god is coming down fast

                        G
it looks like someone I knew

                       A7
uncovered happiness at last


VERSE:
And all the wagging tongues
too much information
in the future now
under massive doubt
the papers on the street
get trampled under feet

A                                                    G
and they settle for a princely sum (no..no..no..)

             Em
good will is coming down

        G
when it rains

             A7
your well is full


You shouldn't ask me
shouldn't ask me

....nose keeps growing

....and after some time you get what you're knowing

....sidecar? superman

....and that's not nothing you wandering for, yeah

He's only
halfway through his life
He's only
used up all his time

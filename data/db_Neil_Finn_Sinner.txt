SINNER
(Neil Finn/Marius deVries)

NOTES: At first this doesn't seem like a very likely acoustic
guitar song, but if you can get two guitarists -- one playing
the rhythm chords, and one playing the little riff, you can do
a really nice version.

These things I should keep to myself
but I feel somehow strangely compelled

I felt no shame, just my spirit awaken

[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Sinner[/tab]

Seeing everything, got my eyes got my face


VERSE:
Fireball drop from the sky
all my dreams have come to pass
where's my faith, is it lost
I can't see it til I cast it off

CHORUS:
Sinner there is no such thing
beginner I have learned to sing
forever I must walk this earth
like some forgotten soldier

VERSE:
Today I am still disconnected
to the face that I saw in the clouds
and the closest I get to contentment
is when all of the barriers come down
(Sinner)
these things I should keep to myself
but I feel somehow strangely compelled
and the closest I get to contentment
is when all of the barriers come down

[tab][ch]D[/ch]   		    [ch]Dsus[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Remember who we are supple and new[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]   		       [ch]Dsus[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
If I lose my way you'd tell me the truth for all it's worth[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]   		     [ch]Dsus[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Lifting up your hand show me my rescue[/tab]

[tab]            ?                        [ch]D[/ch]
When I said, truth is worth more than pride[/tab]
[tab]			 [ch]D[/ch]
Truth is worth more than pride[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]   	          [ch]Dsus[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Everything you do continues long after you've gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]   		    [ch]Dsus[/ch]       
Circle overhead the view from the bed[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
So high and lonely[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]   				[ch]Dsus[/ch]
Sixteen times a day he comes to ground[/tab]
[tab]   		  [ch]D[/ch]
to get some attention[/tab]

[tab]	     [ch]Bm[/ch]			      [ch]D[/ch]
What I said, truth is worth more than pride[/tab]

Truth, it cannot be denied
[tab][ch]D[/ch]			 [ch]G[/ch]
Truth is worth more than pride[/tab]

[tab]	  [ch]Bm[/ch]		   [ch]C[/ch]
They have showered me with riches[/tab]
[tab]					[ch]Bm[/ch]
And they say that I am worthy of their love[/tab]
[tab] 	  [ch]C[/ch]
and their attention[/tab]
[tab]			      [ch]D[/ch]	
But they still don't know the truth[/tab]

[tab]                  [ch]Dsus[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Everything you do continues long after you've gone[/tab]
            
What I said, truth is worth more than pride
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]		[ch]D[/ch]
Truth cannot be denied[/tab]
[tab]			 [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Truth is worth more than pride[/tab]

[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Dsus[/ch]
The view from the bed so high and lonely[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
So high and lonely[/tab]
[tab]			[ch]G[/ch]	[ch]Cadd9[/ch]	[ch]D[/ch]
Truth is worth more than pride, hey hey hey[/tab]
								
View from the bed, so high and lonely

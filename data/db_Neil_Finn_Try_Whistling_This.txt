[tab][ch]D/F#[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Tales from my head[/tab]

[tab][ch]D/F#[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
can't buy the book[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]D#/G[/ch]*                     [ch]D/F#[/ch]
no one's listening but I guess you could[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
try whistling this[/tab]


[Verse]
You say you're tired
liquid is water
but you'll succumb now as I stroke your back
I'm the best that you know


[Bridge]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch](V)
And every time you think of me[/tab]

[tab][ch]G#[/ch]    
I hope you think of true romance[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
and everytime you want to leave[/tab]

[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
you give us both a another chance[/tab]


[Verse]
Warmest welcome violent stranger
he said come here as he pushed me down
impossible to do
in high heels walking into walls
ever wonder if you're here at all
try whistling this

[Verse]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
Blistering Pree, all smiling and swollen[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
Makes babies to breathe[/tab]

With their hearts hanging open
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
All over the sheets as soft as beets[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
In some brown dresser drawer[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And with bees in her breath[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
And the rest of her ringing[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
They'll sting through her chest[/tab]

With a force hard and beating
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
'Til wonderfully wet she will get[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
Until she's soaked inside her clothes[/tab]

[tab]                                 [ch]E[/ch]
And there is no sorry to be sorry for[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
For a roll around the floor[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]E[/ch]
Some afternoon, so sound and soft[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
It made her swallow all her sweat[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]E[/ch]
With every bit of breath she coughs[/tab]

[tab]                            [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
And when the day it came to pour[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
All her babies all across the bathroom floor[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
She will be swimming in them all forevermore[/tab]

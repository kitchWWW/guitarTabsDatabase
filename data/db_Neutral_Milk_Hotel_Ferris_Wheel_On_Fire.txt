Ferris Wheel On Fire - Neutral Milk Hotel

I put the chords over the rest of the lyrics because I like to have them there while I'm playing.  
Otherwise this is the same as the first version on here.

Both barre chords. Barre F on the first 
fret and G on the third. The F-G pattern continues through all verses.

[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
Well now first of all[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]
We became what we always had feared[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
Every engine holds[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
All their oils on fire appeared[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]
They finally broke through[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And on your shoulder[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]F[/ch]
This weight has been placed upon you[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
And everything we ever learned[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]
But now I'm keeping still[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
In someone's bright carnival ride[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]
All the crowd just cheers[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]
As the bolts break and metal collides[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]
Spiraling through[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
And flying up over the hills[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]
And now everything's broken in two[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
And everything we ever would[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
But now most of all[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
I am holding you under my skin[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                       
Watch these buildings fall[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
Watch as each weak resistance caves in[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]            
All over you, all over[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
And now finally fading from view[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]    
Is everything we ever knew[/tab]


Repeat F and G throughout the last part.

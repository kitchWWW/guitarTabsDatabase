How Do you Sleep 
http://www.neverthebride.com/

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Every time I wake up[/tab]

I’m holding out my hand

Struggling with my make-up
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Who says what makes a man[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I’m question in my innocence[/tab]

I’m wondering where you’ve gone

Trapped inside my troubled mind
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Where your memory lingers on[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
How do you sleep?  Why did you do it?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
How can you breathe? You lied to me.[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
You walked right out and blew it.[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Why did you leave? How do you sleep?[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
This never should have happened [/tab]

But I guess you needed more

You should have left temptation 
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Standing at your door[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
Cause if god made man and woman[/tab]

Then he must have made me too

And filled me up with this special love
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
And I gave it all to you[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
How do you sleep?[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
Why did you do it?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
How can you breathe?[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
You lied to me.[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
You walked right out and blew it.[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
Why did you leave?[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
How do you sleep?[/tab]
 
[tab][ch]AM[/ch]                                [ch]F[/ch]
If I’d have thought for just one minute[/tab]

maybe I could believe 

that you lied and deceived

[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
How do you sleep? Why did you do it?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
How can you breathe? You lied to me.[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
You walked right out and blew it.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]
Why did you leave?[/tab]
  
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
How do you sleep? Why did you do it?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
How can you breathe,[/tab]
 
when you lied and deceived
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Baby how do you sleep? Why did you do it?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
Why did you leave? How do you sleep? [/tab]

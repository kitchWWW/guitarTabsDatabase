[Intro]
| [ch]A[/ch]  | [ch]A[/ch]  |


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
 I know the moment we were through[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
 It was just the other day[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
 Like a bolt from the blue[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
 Twenty years along the way[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
 I shoulda seen it coming[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
But I was blinded by your light[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
 So I finally see the truth[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
 And it's all so plain to see[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
 That I'm never changing you[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
 And you're never changing me[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
 So I came to say goodbye[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
Then you turn around and smile[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]
You make me wanna stay[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]
How many years have I been leaving? (Have I been leaving)[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
You make me wanna stay[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
One look in your eyes and I keep believing (And I keep believing)[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
I keep running away[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F#m[/ch]
I hold out hope, but I'm just dreaming (But I'm just dreaming)[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
You make me wanna stay[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
 Now I'm lying in your bed[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
 And I'm lying to myself[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
 Said I'd never do it again[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
 But I just can't help myself[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
 'Cause you keep me coming[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
I'm still blinded by your light[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]
You make me wanna stay[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]
How many years have I been leaving? (Have I been leaving)[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
You make me wanna stay[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
One look in your eyes and I keep believing (And I keep believing)[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
I keep running away[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F#m[/ch]
I hold out hope, but I'm just dreaming (But I'm just dreaming)[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
You make me wanna stay[/tab]

Do you remember, or should I rewind?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
To that summer when you caught my eye.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
I played it cool, the weather was hot,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
You had the beauty and the beach on lock.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
With your flip flops, half shirt, short shorts, mini skirt,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Walkin on the beach so pretty[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
You wasnt lookin for a man when you saw me in the sand,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
But you fell for the boy from the city.[/tab]

&lt;Prechorus>
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
I was like, "hey, girl, can I get your number"[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
I remember what you told me too,[/tab]

"Don't call after ten"[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
But you know that I did,[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'bout you.[/tab]

&lt;Chorus>
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
I think about you in the summertime,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And all the good times we had, baby,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
Been a few years and I can't deny,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
The thought of you still makes me crazy,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Dm[/ch]
I think about you in the summertime,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                          [ch]Dm[/ch]
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind.[/tab]

You are, my summertime[/tab]

&lt;Verse 2>
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
Do you remember, I'll never forget,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Touchin' your body all soakin' wet,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
The water was cool, The feelin' was hot,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Dm[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Kissin' on you while the ocean rocked.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
In your strapless sundress, Kickin' back, no stress,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
As long as we was together,[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
'Cause we were feelin' young love, And we couldn't get enough.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Baby, I could reminisce forever.[/tab]

&lt;Prechorus>
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
And now I'm like, Hey, girl, don't you know I miss it,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
And I wonder if you miss it too,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
Never thought it would end 'til it did,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Now, I'm here and I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you.[/tab]

Summer ended, Winter started,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
It got colder, When we parted ways, (I like this part.)[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Dm[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
As the seasons change. (Bring it forward, bring it back)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
Winter melted, Spring I felt it,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]

My summertime.[/tab]

[Verse 1]

[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
Mother told me that we never fail to kill the things we love[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
The act of suffocation feels like stars from up above[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
I say "I'm gone," please tell me I can stay[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm so ugly on the skin but I'm lovely from within[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]Em[/ch]
My mind glistens like diamonds, and my flesh dripping with sin[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
I say "please leave," but I'm hoping that you'll stay[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]                        [ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
It's easy 'cause you're breaking my heart, love you 'til the end[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
Like that we'll never be apart, murder your best friend[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]      
And you said "we were meant to be as thick as thieves,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
You know I am your troubled child, set me free"[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]Em[/ch]
I swept the streets of your kingdom and I loved you like a brother[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]Em[/ch]
I told myself it's fine because you're bound to find another[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]      
My suitcase is packed and I think it's time to go[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
I'll look out at the ocean, think of you from time to time[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]Em[/ch]  
Just please remember darling that you're always on my mind[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
I tell you "I love you" all I hear is "yeah I know"[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]                        [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]
It's easy 'cause you're breaking my heart, love you 'til the end[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
Like that we'll never be apart, murder your best friend[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]      
And you said "we were meant to be as thick as thieves,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
You know I am your troubled child, set me free"[/tab]


[Verse 3]

[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
I'll love you forever until the stars, they realign[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
A soon faithful position in the cosmos, space, and time[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
I'm a part of the heavens and I know I'm beautiful[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]                        [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]

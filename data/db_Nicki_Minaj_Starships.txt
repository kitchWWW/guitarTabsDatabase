Jump in my hoopty hoopty hoop
I own that
And I ain't paying my rent this month
I owe that
But f-ck who you want, and f-ck who you like
Dance our life, there's no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

Now everybody let me hear you say ray ray ray
Now spend all your money 'cause they pay pay pay
And if you're a G, you're a G G G!
My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki

Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop..


Starships were meant to fly

Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop..

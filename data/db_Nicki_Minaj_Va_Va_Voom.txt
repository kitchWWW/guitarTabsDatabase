[Nicki Minaj]
Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He could become my little problem
'cause he look like he modeling clothes in Dublin
So I think that he gettin' that Green Goblin
Hear through the grape vine that he hang low
We could shoot a movie, could bang, like Rambo
Boom boom pow, this thing so bingo
Wondering if he could understand my lingo
('cause I know he got a wife at home)
(But I need just one night alone)
(If he keep playing them kidding games)
(Imma run away aye, Imma run away aye aye)

[Chorus:]
Ah ah I wanna give you
One last option
Ah ah I wanna give you
One last chance
I-If you're looking for the
Main attraction
Just hold on tight and
Let me do my dance
If you want it I'm gonna be
Va va voom, voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be
Va va voom, voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom boom

[Nicki Minaj]

And I can tell you're feeling me from the jump

Lemme show you how I run take you to my playground
Come and get this va va voom voom

[Chorus:]

[intro] [ch]Dm[/ch],[ch]F[/ch],[ch]C[/ch]

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Baptized with a perfect name[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
The doubting one by heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
Alone without himself[/tab]

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
War between him and the day[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
Need someone to blame[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Dm[/ch]
In the end, little he can do alone[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Dm[/ch]
You believe but what you see[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
You receive but what you give[/tab]

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]
Caress the one, the Never-Fading[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]       [ch]Dm[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]             
Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
In a land of the daybreak[/tab]

Apart from the wandering pack
In this brief flight of time we reach
For the ones, whoever dare

You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give

Caress the one, the Never-Fading
Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak

Caress the one, the Never-Fading
Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak

Reaching, searching for something untouched
Hearing voices of the Never-Fading calling

Caress the one, the Never-Fading
Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak

Caress the one, the Never-Fading
Rain in your heart - the tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak

[Verse]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
It's easy to forget[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am7[/ch]
That everyone makes their own mistakes[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
And everyone's trying[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C/G[/ch]
As much as they can[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
It's easy to ignore[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am7[/ch]
Everything that I need to change[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
Cause I'm looking[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C/G[/ch]
At everybody else instead[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]Em7[/ch] 
If I don't forgive and forget it[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
Than I'm sure I'll regret it inside[/tab]

So I'll try

[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Who Am I to judge?[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Who am I to think I know their hearts?[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am7[/ch]
Who am I to think I'm right[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C9[/ch]
To think that I'm better than they are?[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
Who am I to turn the other way[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Because of the mistakes that someone's made?[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am7[/ch]
When I got mine[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C9[/ch]
Who am I? Who am I?[/tab]
[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Am7[/ch]  [ch]C9[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C/G[/ch]

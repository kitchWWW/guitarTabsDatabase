I had a dream about a dog
I was walking
In an amusement park
With people all around me
 
We rode the roller coaster rides
And he was laughing as we
Jumped in the sky
And I saw that I looked just like him
 
It's a dog's life
I wanna lead a dog's life
Run in the woods, dig a hole
just him and me
 
He showed me all the various
Scented treasures on the ground
There was a little girl
She was scared of me, and i was scared of her
 
He led out a bark and she screamed
Dropped her chocolate ice cream
Suddenly this old man
Chased us till we jumped the fence
 
It's a dog's life
I wanna lead a dog's life
Under the couch, chew a bone
just him and me
 
He ran across the street
and barely missed a speeding car
Suddenly this old man
Grabbed him, from around the corner
 
I hid behind a big trash can
Wondered what's become of him
I tried to stay
But curiosity kills me
 
It's a dog's life
I wanna lead a dog's life
Under a couch, chew a bone
just him and me
 
It's a dog's life
I wanna lead a dog's life
Run in the woods, dig a hole
just him and me
 
It's a dog's life, I wanna lead
It's a dog's life, I wanna be
It's a dog's life, I wanna lead

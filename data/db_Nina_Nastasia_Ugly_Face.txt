Ugly face
Don't ever make it again
It's making me limp
In a wider space
I never know noticed
The sharp turns that it takes

Careless mouth
Doesn't deserve all the rhymes
That come tumbling out
It should starve itself

I want you
I want you
I want to strike you

The violent face
Crashing into a chair
Dropping glass everywhere
It's an ugly face
Don't ever make it again
It's making me limp

I want you
I want you
I want to strike you

In a wider space
I never noticed
The sharp turns that it takes

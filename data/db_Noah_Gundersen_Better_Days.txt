A couple lifetimes, maybe more[/tab]

Just out of reach[/tab]

Of a freaked out kid learning to swim[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
He was doing his best[/tab]

He was holding his breath[/tab]

We met when I was 22[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]B[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
In San Diego when I was on tour[/tab]

And left a beautiful wife and baby boy[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]
I may never understand[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
The full measure of a man[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]B[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]

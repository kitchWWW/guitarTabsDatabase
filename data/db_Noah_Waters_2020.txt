[Intro]
[ch]Bb[/ch]  [ch]Gm[/ch]  [ch]Eb[/ch]  [ch]Bb[/ch] x2

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Nowadays, everybody hurts[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
We've got race wars, plagues[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
And everyday I'm praying that this year just won't get worse[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
There was a time I thought I'd make it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
I said, "2020 is the year I'm living up"[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
But now that people struggle just to say they're fine?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
I'm just happy I'm alive[/tab]

[Pre-chorus 1]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Life keeps getting harder like that's all it knows to do[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
But who'd have thought that things would get this far?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
Well now I'm running forward and I'm in it without you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
We're not dying from a broken heart[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
We're working hard, don't know what we're leaving for the world[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Gm[/ch]
Don't want to die, scared to death that everything will fall[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Eb[/ch]                                                                   [ch]Bb[/ch]
And even though I still don't know what I'm doing with my life, I'm doing fine[/tab]

It's 2020


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
We've all seen seasons change[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
But even all these passing days don't[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                         [ch]Bb[/ch]
Change much, no they don't change much[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
And everyone I know will say the year's gone bad, but[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
I was just afraid that all the world's gone mad, like we're[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                                   [ch]Bb[/ch]
Stuck now, and we're never good again[/tab]

[Pre-chorus 2]
[tab]  [ch]Bb[/ch]
I guess it's all the same if no one ever cares,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Gm[/ch]
Cause I was always waiting for the one who'll bear[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Eb[/ch]                         [ch]Bb[/ch]
My pain and suffer along with me[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
We're working hard, don't know what we're leaving for the world[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Gm[/ch]
Don't want to die, scared to death that everything will fall[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Eb[/ch]                                                                   [ch]Bb[/ch]
And even though I still don't know what I'm doing with my life, I'm doing fine[/tab]

It's 2020

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]

Running all night into the day and I[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                                   [ch]Bb[/ch]

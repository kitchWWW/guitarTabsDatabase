To be someone must be a wonderful thing[/tab]

A famous footballer or a rock singer

To be rich and have a lot of fans[/tab]

have lots of girls to prove that I'm a man

to be Number one -  and liked by  everyone[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Getting drugged up with my trendy friends[/tab]

And the money that I spend - it is like my fame - and it's quickly gone[/tab]

Bridge:

[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
no more swimming in my guitar shaped pool[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
no more reporters at my beck and call[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
no more cocaine it's only ground chalk[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
and no more taxis now we have to walk[/tab]

Chorus:

[tab][ch]D[/ch]             [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
But didn't we have a nice time?[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah wasn't it such a nice time?[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]       [ch]C2[/ch]    
Didn't we have a nice time?[/tab]

Verse 4:

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I realize I should have stuck to my guns[/tab]

They shit me out just like a bastard son
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch] [ch]Em7[/ch]  [ch]A7sus2[/ch]   [ch]Cmaj7[/ch] [ch]Em7[/ch]              [ch]A7sus2[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
and I lost myself - and I know that it was wrong - but it's cost me a lot[/tab]

Bridge:

[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
And there's no more drinking when the club shuts down,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
I'm out here on my arse with the rest of the clowns[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
I am really scared without my bodyguard[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
And I am sitting on my own in my expensive yard[/tab]

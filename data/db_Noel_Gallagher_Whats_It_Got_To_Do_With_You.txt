[tab][ch]C[/ch] [ch]Gsus4[/ch]
Ask me how I feel[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fadd9[/ch] [ch]Am7[/ch]
I've got another day and a half to spare[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch] [ch]Gsus4[/ch]
It'll probably make you squeal[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fadd9[/ch] [ch]Am7[/ch]
Sympathise but you never prepare[/tab]

Do you really want to know?
Or is it just so you can laugh at me?
Say I'm sad and you say so
It's your attitude
Is what you thought it to be
What must my friends think of me?
There is another world, there has to be

Don't harass me no more
Can we talk about something else now please?
I don't want to say anymore
Can we talk about someone else now please?
She said I didn't understand
She said I didn't care
Well it's just not true

It makes me think that it was bad
What's it got to do with you?
Well it's got nothing to with you
It's got nothing to with you

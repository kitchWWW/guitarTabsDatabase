[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Apple blossom, apple blossom when you're blooming in the spring[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Bees are buzzing birds are nesting can't you hear them sing[/tab]

There is blue birds in the orchard flying down the nest box trail
[tab]                                                [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]

From august to october we'll be picking in the sun[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
The days of harvest are almost over don't forget to leave the one[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
You can cut them up and fry them you can put them in a pie[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
If I can make my home an apple well I think I might try[/tab]

It's apple fritters in the morning but it's cider all night
[tab]                                   [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
If that cider don't kill me well I think I'll never die[/tab]

I will pick a peck of apples for you four quarts to a can[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
And I'll pick a hundred bushels more if I can be a man[/tab]

Day are shorter nights are colder and the leaves are turning brown
[tab]                                      [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]FM7[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
There something about the way we fall apart[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]FM7[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]  
Like everything that matters, didn’t matter from the start[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]FM7[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]    
Everyone around us played a part[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]FM7[/ch]             
Wrecking ball came crashing through the window[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]FM7[/ch]
Structures that we carry in our heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]            
And all I ever asked of you[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]FM7[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]         
Is just to be the woman that you wanted to[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
It’s all I ever asked[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]FM7[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
Just outside the city on a Sunday last July[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]FM7[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
The girl’s name was Brandy but we called her Caroline[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]           [ch]FM7[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
No one even knew her history[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]FM7[/ch] 
Said she came from somewhere in the southland[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]FM7[/ch]
Feels like she was coming straight for me[/tab]

I was playing nine ball with two guys I knew from work
This junkie local starts acting like a jerk
Saw him put his hand up Brandy’s skirt
And I don’t know what happened next
In retrospect I lost my head and think I went berserk

By the time they pulled me off him I was almost coming to
Bleeding at the knuckles, she says nice to meet you
And the cops will probably be here in a flash
We hailed a cab we both got in
And watched that taxi driver slam his foot down on the gas

CHORUS (SAME CHORDS WITH EVERY CHORUS)
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]FM7[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Must be a fool like me to be with a fool like you[/tab]
F5/C  (E0 A3 D3 G0 B1 e0 is how to play this weird chord)
Oh oh oh
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]FM7[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch] 
Must be a fool like me to be with a fool like you[/tab]
[tab][ch]F5/C[/ch]
But I ain’t nobody’s fool[/tab]

Next few months we spent a lot of time up in the room
Laughed a lot, drank a lot, yeah we tried to shoot the moon
And in the morning time she'd always disappear
I agreed, I'd never ask her questions
With the chance of an answer I don't wanna hear

One morning, she crying on the stoop outside my place
She tryin’ to hide it, there’s sadness on her face
Oh is there anything I can do?
She said perhaps if you would drop this package off
I would hate to inconvenience you

Well they say a suckers born, every sixty seconds time
I knew I shouldn't do it, but I put it from my mind
And, oh if you knew that gal of mine
You’d understand, I got no hand in making that decision
Reason got no rhyme

Must be a fool like me to be with a fool like you
Oh oh oh
Must be a fool like me to be with a fool like you
But I ain't nobody's fool
Nobody's fool no more

I knocked at the address that she gave waited for a few
Looked inside the window and I saw a kid or two
Next thing I knew a burner in my face
There's just some shit you never can erase

Both my hands were shaking as the sun began to rise
I got back to my house, she was gone I'm not surprised
You can never ground a bird that needs to fly
Oh I got into that urge to move
Thanks to you, my wrecking ball Caroline

Must be a fool like me to be with a fool like you
Oh oh oh
Must be a fool like me to be with a fool like you
Oh oh oh
Must be a fool like me to be with you
Oh oh oh
Must be a fool like me to be with you
But I ain't nobody's fool
Nobody's fool no more
No more

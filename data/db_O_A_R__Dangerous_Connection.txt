[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
I never wanted anything like this[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                             [ch]C[/ch]
You're right beside me don't know who I missed[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                         [ch]C[/ch]
Send me a smile, I know you'll do your best[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Your heart's a suspect are we faking this[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
All I can say it's a big surprise[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Watching those colors change inside your eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Blue to gray, yeah[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I turn away[/tab]
[tab][ch]Amin[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
All it does is turn you on[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]Amin[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
All it does is turn you on[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
Baby this night was all a dream[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe daylight won't ask me questions[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe this night was all a dream[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
A dangerous connection[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
What a dangerous connection[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
What a dangerous connection[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
You seem to find a way to tear apart[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]C[/ch]
Every discussion leaves new battle scars[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
When it hurts to love you[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
I just numb the pain[/tab]

But I'm having trouble feeling anything
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
And you want for answers[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]
And I can't reply[/tab]

Take my advances

Is my way to try
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You again, yeah[/tab]


[tab][ch]Emin[/ch]
I turn away[/tab]
[tab][ch]Amin[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
All it does is turn you on[/tab]
[tab][ch]Emin[/ch]           [ch]Amin[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
All it does is turn me on[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
Baby this night was all a dream[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe daylight won't ask me questions[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe this night was all for me[/tab]

A dangerous connection[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe daylight won't ask us questions[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe this night was all for me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]

real easy song to play. The lyrics aren't 100% exact though. If
anyone knows the solo or bass line please post.


Verse:

[ch]C[/ch] - [ch]Em[/ch] - [ch]Am[/ch] - [ch]G[/ch]

(listen to the song for the rhythm):

If one guitar plays the chords over the other rhythm it sounds
really cool

Love is never enough Throughout time
This song's(?) given up Will kept me standing alone
If only I could have one dance I could move on my own
In tattered daydreams that slip through the night
I'm a prince king warrior And I'm moving things right
But every daydream Leaves me awake every night
If I was a bird I'd spread my wings Take off and fly

(Chorus) I had the swirl and ache From sprays of honeysuckle
That when they're gathered break Dew on the knuckle.
I craved small sweets, but those seemed small when I was young
The petal of the rose was stung

So in this dream I walk with my head heald high
Cause here I'll live forever and never die
I see my soul straight ahead with his eyes locked on mine
If I should wake right now I'd rather be blind
And in these dreams with love together we'd stand
I slip falling to Earthward and I can't reach your hand

(Chorus)

My eyes open wide and I've lost myself
I'm laying here in my bed theres nobody else
Surrounded by questions hate can look so cold(?)
I clasp my hands together and pray ask what its all for
Its easy for me to slip away and live on the air
If we'd all let love live we would all be there
But time has a way of saying it time to move on
So off to my kingdom I go where I feel at home

(Chorus)

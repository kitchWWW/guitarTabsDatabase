[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
Called her last night[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I read her a line, from her favorite book of poetry[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
And I started to cry[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
When she asked me what was wrong, I said, "Don't worry, it's not you, it's me"[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
 It's fine to say[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
That everything you've done to me has been excused by you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Now I know that's its plain to see[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Every line I read to you is coming from deep inside of me[/tab]

[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
She called me last night[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And read me a line from her favorite book of poetry[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
And she started to cry[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
When I asked her what was wrong, she said, "Don't worry, it's not you, it's me"[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
 It's plain to see[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
All these stories told to me are false[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
And I know               Oh[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
She's telling me lies, telling me lies like hte sun is blue[/tab]
[ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
sooner or later its come to pass one of these poems will have to last[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Sooner or later, she's gonna have to come to pass[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
This poetry[/tab]

[Verse 3]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
I called her last night[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
And we finally talked for what seemed like the very first time[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
So I start to cry[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Seem like we don't know each other no more, and these words they[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Describe you to a T[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Telling you about me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
It's writen verse by verse, line by line, just you and me[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
  and I just wish I could describe with my pen one day done throughout the time[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]F[/ch]
In these books of poetry[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                                                [ch]F[/ch]
It seems like its all written just about, written just about her and me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
All this love poetry, good and bad[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]F[/ch]
Written just about you and me[/tab]

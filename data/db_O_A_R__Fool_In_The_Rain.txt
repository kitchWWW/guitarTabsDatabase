*THIS IS MY FIRST TAB* (Hope You Enjoy, Please Be Gentle)

Originally a Led Zeppelin song, it is also a very good cover O.A.R. does a lot on tour. 
a crowd favorite and fits really well with their jam band-esque style.

It's very simple and if you look up a video/audio clip it plays very well along with it 
plays well with the Led Zeppelin version).

The chords are C, F, and another which I'll tab since I'm not sure of the official chord.

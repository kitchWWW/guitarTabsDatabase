Artist: O.A.R.
Song: Gas Was Low
Genre: 
Key: 


the song is pretty much the same cords over and over again. except for
the G chord.  It starts out with the full G and then when you come back it is
played with just one finger on the small e string (not another finger on the
string right above that), then back to the full G.  Here it is:

>--0--------2--------0--------0-----------------------------------&lt;
>--3--------1--------1--------0-----------------------------------&lt;
>--3--------0--------0--------3-----------------------------------&lt;[/tab]


The strumming is something around down-down-up-down, except for the first chord
which is a little bit longer.  Just repeat this until the end of the song.

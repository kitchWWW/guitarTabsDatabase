[tab][ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]Gb[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Gb[/ch]                                   [ch]E[/ch]
And late at night a hand would knock and there [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]B[/ch]
would stand a stranger.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]Gb[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]B[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]

#1.
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]
Yeah, the weeds were high, the corn was dry when [/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]                       [ch]Gb[/ch]
Him and Sally Walker, they up and ran away.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]B[/ch]
Then Momma shed a silent tear and promised fourteen [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]     [ch]Gb[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]

[tab][ch]B[/ch]          [ch]Abm[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]
When Momma sacrificed her pride, the neighbours [/tab]

started talking.
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
But we were much too young to understand the things [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Gb[/ch]
they said.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dbm[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]
All we really cared about was Momma's chicken and [/tab]

dumplings.
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]       [ch]Gb[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]
And a goodnight kiss before we went to bed.[/tab]

CHORUS:
[tab]        [ch]Gb[/ch]
Oh, the path was deep and wide from footsteps [/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
leading to our cabin.[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]Gb[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Gb[/ch]                                   [ch]E[/ch]
And late at night a hand would knock and there [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]B[/ch]
would stand a stranger.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]Gb[/ch]               B.....Db [ch]Bbm7[/ch]

[tab][ch]Db[/ch]                  [ch]Gb[/ch]          [ch]Db[/ch]
When Daddy left and destitution came upon our family.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]                [ch]Db[/ch]                            [ch]Ab[/ch]
Not one neighbour volunteered to lend a helping hand.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Gb[/ch]                               [ch]Db[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]Gb[/ch]                [ch]Db[/ch]     [ch]Ab[/ch]         [ch]Db[/ch]
The proof is standing here a full grown man.[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]Gb[/ch]                        [ch]Db[/ch]

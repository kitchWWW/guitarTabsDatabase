Damn, all this time, I feel I can't answer the questions[/tab]
[tab]                                               [ch]C[/ch]
Who we are, why we're here, we're living and dying[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]G[/ch]

We're perfect but we're just not right[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]
We turn it over, there's still light[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
And after all this good[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
Can't get my head around the truth[/tab]

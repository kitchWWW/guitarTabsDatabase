[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Son, let me tell you how much I love you[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
And I hope you and your mama understand[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
How sorry I am for not being here[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
When you needed my heart and my hands[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
But believe me when I say it's gonna be different now[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
No more nights wondering where daddy is[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
From now on I'm gonna be right here for you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
Can you find it in your heart to forgive[/tab]

You see

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Daddies need to grow up too[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]G[/ch]
Learn what they should and they shouldn't do[/tab]

In a way we're a lot like you
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
We need some understanding[/tab]

Daddies stumble, daddies fall
[tab]                              [ch]A[/ch]
We don't really know it all[/tab]

I'm gonna try and make it up to you
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Daddies need to grow up too[/tab]

[ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Son, I know that you've looked up to me[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
Even when I let you down and made you cry[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
But tonight it's me who feels like crying[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
And you're the hero in my eyes[/tab]

You see

[Verse 1]

[tab]    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
I really can't stay[/tab]
               But baby it's cold outside
[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]G7[/ch]
I've got to go away[/tab]
             But baby it's cold outside
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
The evening has been[/tab]
             Been hoping that you'd drop in
[tab]        [ch]Dm7[/ch]                 [ch]G7[/ch]             [ch]C7[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]
So very nice[/tab]
             I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice


[Chorus]

[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                                      [ch]Am7[/ch]
My mother will start worry[/tab]
                    Beautiful whatâ€™s your hurry?
[tab]     [ch]Am7[/ch]                                                   [ch]C[/ch]
And father will be pacing the floor[/tab]
                                   Listen to the fireplace roar
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]D7[/ch]
So really i'd better scurry[/tab]
                   Beautiful please don't hurry
[tab]     [ch]D7[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
But maybe just a half a drink more[/tab]
                              Put some records on while I pour

[Verse 2]

[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
The neighbors might think[/tab]
                    Baby it's bad out there
[tab]      [ch]Dm7[/ch]                        [ch]G7[/ch]
Say, what's in this drink?[/tab]
                   No cabs to be had out there
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                                       [ch]Gm7/C[/ch]
I wish i knew how[/tab]
              Your eyes are like starlight now
[tab]             [ch]Gm7/C[/ch]              [ch]C7[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
To break the spell[/tab]
               I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

[Chorus]

[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                                          [ch]D7[/ch]
I ought to say, "No, no, no sir"[/tab]
                           Mind if I move in closer?
[tab]   [ch]D7[/ch]                         [ch]G7[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
At least i'm gonna say that i tried[/tab]
                              What's the sense in hurtin' my pride?
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Bb7[/ch]         [ch]A7[/ch]
I really can't stay[/tab]
               Baby don't hold out
[tab]             [ch]D7[/ch]    [ch]G7[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
Ah, but it's cold outside[/tab]

[ch]Dm7[/ch]  [ch]Ab[/ch]  [ch]G7[/ch]

[Verse 3]

[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
I simply must go[/tab]
             Baby, it's cold outside
[tab]    [ch]Dm7[/ch]                        [ch]G7[/ch]
The answer is no[/tab]
             Ooh darling, it's cold outside
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
This welcome has been[/tab]
               I'm lucky that you dropped in
[tab]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]              [ch]Gm7[/ch]    [ch]C7[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
So nice and warm[/tab]
                Look out the window at that storm

[Chorus]

[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                                      [ch]Am7[/ch]
My sister will be suspicious[/tab]
                   Man, your lips look delicious
[tab]   [ch]Am7[/ch]                                               [ch]C[/ch]
My brother will be there at the door[/tab]
                               Waves upon a tropical shore
[tab]   [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                        [ch]D7[/ch]
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious[/tab]
                         Gosh your lips are delicious
[tab]     [ch]D7[/ch]                      [ch]G7[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Well maybe just a half a drink more[/tab]
                               Never such a blizzard before

[Verse 4]

[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
I've got to go home[/tab]
               Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
[tab]      [ch]Dm7[/ch]                    [ch]G7[/ch]
Say, lend me your coat[/tab]
             It's up to your knees out there
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                                         [ch]Gm7/C[/ch]
You've really been grand[/tab]
                I thrill when you touch my hand
[tab]              [ch]Gm7/C[/ch]          [ch]C7[/ch]
But don't you see?[/tab]
              How can you do this thing to me?

[Chorus]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                                     [ch]D7[/ch]
There's bound to be talk tomorrow[/tab]
                        Think of my life long sorrow
[tab]   [ch]D7[/ch]                              [ch]G7[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
At least there will be plenty implied[/tab]
                               If you caught pneumonia and died
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Bb7[/ch]          [ch]A7[/ch]
I really can't stay[/tab]
              Get over that hold out
[tab]          [ch]D7[/ch]    [ch]G7[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Bb7[/ch]  [ch]A7[/ch]  [ch]D7[/ch]  [ch]G7[/ch]  [ch]C9[/ch]
Baby it's cold, Baby it's cold outside[/tab]

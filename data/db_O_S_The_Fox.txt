[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] 

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
I found the fox in the woods[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch] 
She was cold and hungry[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
I gave her all that I could[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
I was sure that she loved me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]   
And we were thick as thieves.[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
Through the winter I kept her warm[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch] 
Fed her all she desired[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
When she told me in so many words[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
I was the one to save her life[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch] 
And she would never forget[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
And I would never be left.[/tab]

[Verse 3]
         
But then one day
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
I ran out of bread[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
And wood to keep the fire[/tab]

And when I woke
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
I found she had fled[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch] 
To the house down the river[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch] 
And I cried all night[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Because I had thought she was mine.[/tab]

[Outro]

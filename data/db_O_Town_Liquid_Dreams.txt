[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                 [ch]Fm[/ch]
Now this hot girl, she's not your average girl[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]Cm[/ch]
She's a morpharotic dream from a magazine[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                 [ch]Fm[/ch]
And she's so fine designed to blow your mind[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Cm[/ch]
She's a dominatrix supermodel beauty queen[/tab]

[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                                  [ch]Fm[/ch]
I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Cm[/ch]
Just a little touch Madonna's wild style[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                                     [ch]Fm[/ch]
With Janet Jackson's smile, throw in a body like Jennifer's[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Cm[/ch]
You've got the star of my liquid dream[/tab]

Angelina Jolie's lips to kiss in the dark
Underneath Cindy C's beauty mark
When it comes to the test well Tyra's the best
And Salma Hayek brings the rest

Now this hot girl, she's not your average girl
She's a morpharotic dream from a magazine
And she's so fine designed to blow your mind
She's a dominatrix supermodel beauty queen

I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch Madonna's wild style 
With Janet Jackson's smile, throw in a body like Jennifers'
You've got the star of my liquid dreams

Looks ain't everything she's got the sweetest personality
Like Halle B
My mama thinks I'm lazy, my friends all think I'm crazy
But in my mind, I leave the world behind every night I dream
Oh..

Liquid Dreams, my Liquid Dreams
Waterfalls and streams, these liquid dreams

I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just little touch of Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile
Throw in a body like Jennifer's 
You've got the star of my liquid dreams
My liquid dreams

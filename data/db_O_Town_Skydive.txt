Intro:
[ch]Bm[/ch] / [ch]G[/ch] / [ch]D[/ch] / [ch]A[/ch]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
   I'm seeing you again,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
Watching you do all the things we used to do as two[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Bm[/ch]
But now it?s only one, it?s you[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And I remember when we would go for days[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]A[/ch]
In ways we thought would never end[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Bm[/ch]
And now it's over, it's just me[/tab]

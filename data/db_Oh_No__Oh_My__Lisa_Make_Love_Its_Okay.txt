Oh No! Oh My! ~ Lisa, Make Love! (It's Okay!)

Overkill on the exclamation marks there.
Still, excellent song from one of my favourite new bands.

[ch]C/B[/ch][x20010]
[ch]Csus2[/ch] [x30010]
[ch]Em7[/ch] [020000]

Note: The second C - after the C/B - is a hammered
on Csus2.The Em is also hammered onto a Em7. 

You'll see what I mean when you listen to the song.
Enjoy.

Lisa had problems with talking to boys[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]/[ch]Csus2[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]    
She was lonely and tired and sad[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]C/B[/ch]-[ch]C[/ch]
So she sits in her room drinking coffee or ???[/tab]

It was bad it was bad it was bad[/tab]

When she goes to school Lisa sits by herself
All her girlfriends have boyfriends in love
So she talks to no one and no one talks to her
What bad luck what bad luck what bad luck

Once a boy sat by her she had ribbons and curls 
In her hair, Lisa why can't you see?
As you walk away shamed he looks longing to you
Have no clue have no clue have no clue

[ch]C[/ch] - [ch]G[/ch] - [ch]Am[/ch] - [ch]C/B[/ch] - [ch]C[/ch]/[ch]Csus2[/ch] - [ch]G[/ch] - [ch]D[/ch] x2

She walks to the school bus and sits in the back
Where the young kids play poker all wrong
She clips on her headphones and closes her eyes
But she is sick she is sick she is sick

The movies she watches makes her much more distraught
That she thought she could be at one time
It makes sense when she thinks but real life throws in kinks
It's no use it's no use it's no use

Oh Lisa don't be scared you've got nothing to lose
You should go to a party of two
You could dazzle and charm with your small subtle wit
Be a hit be a hit be a hit

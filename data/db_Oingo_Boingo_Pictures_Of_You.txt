[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]F/A[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
Pictures of you, it's just pictures of you, through the bedroom door[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F/A[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
With that sly little grin, says you want it some more[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F/A[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
But there's people around, and they don't look so nice[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F/A[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
Tell me why don't they move, this has happened before[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Adim[/ch]                                       [ch]Am[/ch]  /[ch]C[/ch]  /[ch]B[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
This has happened before, it's just pictures of you, in darkness[/tab]

[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]F/A[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
Pictures of you, I'd been sleeping for hours, when you came to my house[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F/A[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
You'd been lost in a crowd, said you had to get out[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F/A[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
You were covered with tears and you said you were sad[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Adim[/ch]
So you wanted to play, yes, you wanted to play[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]F/A[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]
Well you touched me and smiled, as you let yourself go[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F/A[/ch]                               [ch]Am[/ch]
Oh, but something was wrong, 'cause your touch was so cold[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F/A[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
Like you'd been in the ground and you asked if you could stay[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Adim[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]   /[ch]C[/ch]  /[ch]B[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
And I said no, it's just pictures of you, in darkness[/tab]

[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]F/A[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
Pictures of you, in that lovely white dress, oh your skin was so white[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F/A[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
With the moon in your eyes, on that cold winter night[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F/A[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
When your lips were so soft, that I thought they would melt[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F/A[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
And the sound of your breath and the way that you felt[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Adim[/ch]  
And I said yes, and I said yes[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]F/A[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
It's just pictures of you with a knife in your hand[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F/A[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
With a rose in your teeth lying nude in the sand[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F/A[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
It's just pictures of you, standing high on a cliff[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F/A[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
With the wind in your hair, and a smile on your lips[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F/A[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]
And your eyes were so wild, when you started to laugh[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F/A[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
Blending in with the wind, sounded just like a scream[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Adim[/ch]                                      [ch]Am[/ch]   /[ch]C[/ch]  /[ch]B[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]
Why do pictures of you, come to me when I dream, in darkness[/tab]

[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
Pictures of you, pictures of you, pictures of you[/tab]

THOUGHTS OF YOU
As recorded by Ole 60
(2024 release)


Capo 2nd fret


[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Cadd9[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Pocket change and prescription pills sitting on the window sill[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Of a double queen in some flat top nowhere town[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'm all alone in this hotel room with six dead strings and my thoughts of you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]Cadd9[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
And I know I better write 'em down[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Oh eyes in line and hands together[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
We almost made it through the weather[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Looked up laughed and said where'd November go?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Well it's easier if you don't remember the way we always said forever[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Forever don't mean nothin' anymore[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Oh what the hell was all that lovin' you for?[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
I'm lying here and I'm fighting sleep[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]Cadd9[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Late at night I overthink the good, the bad, the inbetweens, and all[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]Cadd9[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Then again you never really meant to fall[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Oh eyes in line and hands together[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
We almost made it through the weather[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Looked up laughed and said where'd November go?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Well it's easier if you don't remember the way we always said forever[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Forever don't mean nothin' anymore[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Oh what the hell was all that lovin' you for?[/tab]


[Outro]
[ch]Cadd9[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Cadd9[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]

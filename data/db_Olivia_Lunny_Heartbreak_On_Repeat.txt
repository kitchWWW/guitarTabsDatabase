[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Is the devil in my eyes a dead giveaway[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
That I could hurt you like nobody?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]
I would rather be the giver when it comes to pain[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Em[/ch]
Sometimes you gotta use somebody[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
And I call it a success when after we get undressed[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
You say that I was your best and I'm saying, "Next"[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
You wanna be in my world, but everyone here gets hurt[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
I'll sum it up in three words, I warned you[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
If you think that I'm bad for you, yes, I am (Yes, I am)[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
If you want me to love you, you know I can't (You know I can't)[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
And if you feel like I'm lying, I probably am (I probably am)[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Playing heartbreak on repeat, 'round and 'round, baby[/tab]

I'm like a secret on your tongue that you don't have to keep[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
It's better when you let me go[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]Am[/ch]
I'm the kinda girl you want, but not the kind you need[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I think you already know[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]

I'm sorry we didn't speak today[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
I didn't mean to cause offence to you[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
I hope that you can understand some way[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
I was simply searching for a pikachu[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
Cause the sky's blue and that grass Oh so green[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                            
but I've seen all that shiet before[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I stepped outside of my front door[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]  
and the world didn't have much to offer me[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch]
Cause nothing out there I can't see[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
in perfect cristal clear HD[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]F#m[/ch]
Don't you know google maps is free[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B#m[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
So send me pixels of the ocean floor[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  
when you leave[/tab]

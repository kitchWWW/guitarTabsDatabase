[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
i tried to paint you a picture, the colors were all wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
black and white didn't fit ya, and all along[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
you were shaded with patience, and strokes of everything[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
that i need just to make it, but i can see that[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Lord knows i failed you time and again[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]     
but you and me are alright[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A/G[/ch]
we won't break we won't die, it's just a moment of change[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A/G[/ch]

all we need, all we need, a lover's alibi[/tab]

[Verse 2]
(same chords as Verse 1):
i walked a minute in your shoes, they never would have fit
i figured there's nothing to lose, i need to get
some perspective on these words, before i write them down
you're an island and my ship has run aground

[Repeat Pre-Chorus]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Refrain]
[tab][ch]C9[/ch]
and every single day that i can breathe[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
you change my philosophy[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A/G[/ch]
i'm never gonna let you pass me by[/tab]

[Repeat Chorus] 2x

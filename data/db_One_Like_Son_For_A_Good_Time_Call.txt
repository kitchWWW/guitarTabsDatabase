[Verse 1]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
When you see your sister Sam[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Will you tell her how I am[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
That I've gotten over every mess she made[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
And I know about the lies[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
All the men between her thighs[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
And the white trash hearts left floating in her wake[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
And now they're treading water trying not to drown[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
She was the pretty girl, that face[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
the beauty to my beast[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]
And I was the basket case, a boy[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
a mess to say the least[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
But you were just playing games with my heart[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
My head spun round and round[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
When a rich girl kissed this boy[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
From the other side of town[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
Now I've read it all before[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Scratched into the bathroom door[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
For a real good time[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Call Sammy she's a whore[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
But the pictures said it all[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
Scattered on her Facebook wall[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Now I'm writing a best selling tell-it-all[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
And I'm airing out her dirty laundry now[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
She was the pretty girl, that face[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
the beauty to my beast[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]
And I was the basket case, a boy[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
a mess to say the least[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
But you were just playing games with my heart[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
My head spun round and round[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
When a rich girl kissed this boy[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
From the other side of town[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Now Sammy she's a queen[/tab]

A royal pain you seems
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Her public record's clean[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
But her hearts as black as coal[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
But when the sun goes down and she hits the town She's devil's concubine[/tab]


[Solo]
[ch]D[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
She was the pretty girl, that face[/tab]

 At an old church up on the hillside down in that swamp land[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E7[/ch]                              [ch]B7[/ch]
 With a boardwalk they named Self-Denial Bridge[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E7[/ch]                                   [ch]A7[/ch]

[tab]       [ch]B7[/ch]                         [ch]E7[/ch]

 Then the midnight church lights danced upon that water[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E7[/ch]                              [ch]B7[/ch]
 All the creatures in the swamp began to hum[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E7[/ch]                                  [ch]A7[/ch]

[tab]         [ch]B7[/ch]                           [ch]E7[/ch]

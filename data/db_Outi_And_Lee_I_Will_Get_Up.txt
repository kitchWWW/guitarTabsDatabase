I will get up and walk back that road and I know [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
it will lead to my Father's home[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]  
And when I'll see Him I'll fall on my knees and say: [/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Father, I missed You so!   (2x)[/tab]


[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
He surely knew this![/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Didn't I see it in His eyes,[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
when I turned to go, He whispered my name,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
and warned me about those lies.[/tab]


[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]  
I will get up and walk back that road and I know [/tab]

it will lead to my Father's home[/tab]

And when I'll see Him I'll fall on my knees and say: [/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Father, I missed You so!   (2x)[/tab]


[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]
Please, forgive me![/tab]
[tab][ch]Fmaj7[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I'm not worthy to be called Your own.[/tab]

I was such a fool! If I could turn back the wheel of time![/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
There are demons in rule out there! (2x)[/tab]


[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
And I sold my soul..[/tab]

it will lead to my Father's home[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]  
He will embrace me, wipe tears off my face and say: [/tab]

Child, I missed you so! (2x)[/tab]

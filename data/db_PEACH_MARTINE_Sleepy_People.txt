Husband and wife were married underneath the steeple of the church in the town they were born[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
On the way home from the American Cathedral[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]D#[/ch]
The wife tore her wedding gown on a thorn[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Husband bent down, for he had brought a thread and needle[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]D#[/ch]
For exactly this purpose, I'm sure[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                                                                          [ch]D#[/ch]
He showed he could sew, the wife then knocked a little beetle, off the suit hе had only once worn[/tab]

[tab] [ch]B[/ch]                               [ch]Bm[/ch]
They werе sleepy people for the rest of their lives[/tab]

When they think of this time they laugh and they cry[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F#[/ch]
And I kind of know why[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                                                                   [ch]D#[/ch]
Husband went on to get a good job as a banker in a cubical from 9 to 5[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Dreamed of the day he'd be moved to the corner office[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]D#[/ch]
Where he could work in a room with sunlight[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
5 years along their son was born with 10 good fingers[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]D#[/ch]
He grew up watching his parents survive[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                                   [ch]Bm[/ch]
He watched the sleepy people waste the rest of their lives[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F#[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]D#[/ch]
Thinking only of the memories on which they rely[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F#[/ch]
To bring them any delight[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]Bdim[/ch]
And the boy was 45 before he realised[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]F#[/ch]
That he's just waiting to die[/tab]

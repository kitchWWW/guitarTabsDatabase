[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]Em[/ch]
Today I killed a man I didn't know[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
I held my rifle high and shot him low[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Em[/ch]
I'd like to think he really was to blame[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Well I never knew or never will his name[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                        [ch]Em[/ch]
I guess that someone, somewhere knew him well[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
And they'll cry when they're told that he has fell[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]Em[/ch]
But it's hard for me to think of him as good[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F#m[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause he'd done me just the same if he could[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
Oh mother, oh mama, I'm so cold[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#m[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
And I feel like I am quickly growing old[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]Em[/ch]
So I hope you are thinking of your son[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#m[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause tomorrow morning I'll be twenty-one[/tab]

[Stick]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Oh Johnny Ray, Johnny Ray, oh, he don't worry now[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
He don't wonder how[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]Em[/ch]
Today my sergeant told me I've done well[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
That I'd sent another Southern boy to hell[/tab]
[tab]                                              [ch]Em[/ch]
But I can't help wondering about the lost of life[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
And if that rebel soldier had a wife[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
Oh mama, oh mam, I'm so cold[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
And the good book doesn't help me like you told[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]Em[/ch]
'Cause it don't tell me if I'm right or wrong[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Or when this war will end, just how long[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]
Oh mama, oh mama, I'm so cold[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#m[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
And I feel I am quickly growing old[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]Em[/ch]
So I hope that you are thinking of your son[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#m[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause tomorrow morning I'll be twenty-one[/tab]

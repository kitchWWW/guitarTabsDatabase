Here's the lyrics:
I want y'all to check out
This is a Bad Boy tribute to my man the Notorious B.I.G.
which features myself, Faith and 112
Rest in peace B.I.G -- we miss ya


Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin on the block for dough
Notorious they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seems to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream
In the future, can't wait to see
If you'll open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
I'd give anything to hear half your breath
I know you're living you life -- after death

Faith Evans & 112

Every step I take, Every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray -- I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break -- I'll be missing you


It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven smiling down
Watching us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
The strength I need to believe
My thoughts B.I.G. I just can't define
Wish i can turn back the hands of time
Us in the 6th, shopping for new clothes and kicks
You and me taking flicks, making hits
Stages they received you on
I still can't believe you're gone
I'd give anything to hear half your breath
I know your living you life -- after death 


Faith Evans & 112

Somebody tell me why, one glad morning
I know -- I'll see your face

112

Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
(repeat 3X)
Every move I make

I see you tryin' to hurt me bad [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Don't know what you're up against [/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]  
Maybe you should reconsider [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Come up with another plan [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Cuz you know I'm not that kinda girl [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
That'll lay there and let you come first [/tab]

[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
You can push me out the window [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
I'll just get back up [/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
And I won't give a fuck [/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
You can hang me like a slave [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
I'll go underground [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler but [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
You can't keep me down, down, down, down[/tab]

Everything that I say [/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]G[/ch]
There's someone tryin' to short-change me [/tab]

And I'm not gonna break!

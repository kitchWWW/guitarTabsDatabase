[Intro]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]F#m[/ch]       [ch]C#m[/ch]
   No-no-no, no-no-no, no     hey[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]F#m[/ch]       [ch]C#m[/ch]
   No-no-no, no-no-no, no[/tab]


[Verse 1]
[tab]                   [ch]F#m[/ch]
We're driving in a black car and it's blacked out and we're spinning[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]E[/ch] 
We're listening to "Fast Car" and you're driving fast and you're singing[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Don't wanna tell you what I'm feeling[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch] 
Don't want this night to hit a ceiling[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]                  [ch]F#m[/ch]
I'm wearing dirty white shoes, a white t-shirt and your jacket[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]E[/ch] 
I'm laughing, but I'm lying when you're smiling, I'm the saddest[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
I hide my face so you don't see it[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch] 
I think out loud, hope you don't hear it[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 1]
[tab]                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
It's going on 18 months now and it's fucked up, but I'm falling[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch] 
I feel it every day now but I'm stalling, but I'm stalling[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Bm[/ch] 
I'm here, but I'm in pieces and I don't know how to fix this[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C#m[/ch]
And I don't know how to fix this, no[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
If I'm just somebody that you're gonna leave[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#m[/ch]                           [ch]C#m[/ch]
And you don't feel something when you look at me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
You're holding my heart, mmm, whatcha say?[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#m[/ch]                      [ch]C#m[/ch]
Just let me down slowly, I'll be okay[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
If you're just some habit that I gotta break[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#m[/ch]                [ch]C#m[/ch]
I can clear my system in 90 days[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
You're holding my heart, mmm, whatcha say?[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]C#m[/ch]
Just let me down slowly[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]                   [ch]F#m[/ch]
I get up, turn the lights out and it's four o'clock in the morning[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch] 
I close my eyes, I can't sleep a hotel room in New York, and[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
I feel the space that's in between us[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch] 
Convince myself that this is real love[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 2]
[tab]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
'Cause you made this shit so easy and I told you my secrets[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch] 
So I don't know why I'm tongue tied at the wrong time when I need this[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Bm[/ch] 
I'm here, but I'm in pieces and I don't know how to fix this[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C#m[/ch]
And I don't know how to fix this, no[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
If I'm just somebody that you're gonna leave[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]       [ch]F#m[/ch]                           [ch]C#m[/ch]
And you don't feel something when you look at me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
You're holding my heart, mmm, whatcha say?[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#m[/ch]                      [ch]C#m[/ch]
Just let me down slowly, I'll be okay[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
If you're just some habit that I gotta break[/tab]

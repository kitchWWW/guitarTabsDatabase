[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
  Haven't always been this way[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]
I wasn't born a renegade[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]
I felt alone, still feel afraid[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]
I stumbled through it anyway[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 1]
[tab]  [ch]B[/ch]                                         [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
I wish someone would have told me that this life is ours to choose[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]
No one's handing you the keys or a book with all the rules[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]                 [ch]C#m[/ch]
The little that I know I'll tell to you[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]B[/ch]                                    [ch]B[/ch]
When they dress you up in lies and you're left naked with the truth[/tab]


[Chorus 1]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
You threw your head back, and you spit in the wind[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]B[/ch]
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#m[/ch]                                                         [ch]A[/ch]
Let 'em drag you through hell, they can't tell you to change who you are[/tab]

That's all I know so far

[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]                                                    [ch]A[/ch]
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]B[/ch]
That's all I know so far[/tab]
N.C.
     That's all I know so far


[Verse 2]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]
So you might give yourself away, yeah[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
And pay full price for each mistake[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
But when the candy-coating hides the razor blade[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
You can cut yourself loose and use that rage[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 2]
[tab]       [ch]B[/ch]                                    [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
I wish someone would have told me that this darkness comes and goes[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
People will pretend but baby girl, nobody knows[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]C#m[/ch]
And even I can't teach you how to fly[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]B[/ch]
But I can show you have to live like your life is on the line[/tab]


[Chorus 2]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
You threw your head back, and you spit in the wind[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]B[/ch]
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#m[/ch]                                                         [ch]A[/ch]
Let 'em drag you through hell, they can't tell you to change who you are[/tab]

That's all I know so far

[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]                                                    [ch]A[/ch]
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]E[/ch]
That's all I know so far[/tab]

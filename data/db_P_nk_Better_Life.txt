[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I've been up late watching you breathe[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]B[/ch]
Wondering if you're gonna leave[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Don't tell me what you see[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C#m[/ch]
That you actually believe it[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
Fuck, I'm blue[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]                                                  [ch]B[/ch]
And all those photos that you like of a better life, better wife, better nights, better high[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C#m[/ch]
Goddamn right I miss drinking[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
Yeah, I do[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 1]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
I've been up late nights[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]B[/ch]
Staring at the street lights[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
All the cigarette smoke, can't escape a closing window[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]                                   [ch]B[/ch]
And my head's like "What happened to, it's alright?"[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C#m[/ch]
Baby, It's not alright[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
What if we're a closing window?[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]C#m[/ch]
But I can't shake the feeling[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]                 [ch]C#m[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
I   can't shake the feeling (I can't shake the feeling)[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]E[/ch]
Do you picture a better life?[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I found myself up late feeling kinda jealous[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]B[/ch]
Looking at the bullshit, other people's wellness[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C#m[/ch]
And it's got me thinking[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
It's just not you (not you)[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I've been all night looking in the eyes of my baby[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                        [ch]C#m[/ch]
Right in front of me, what a gift, so amazing[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
Oh, that's what's true[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 2]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]
But I stay up late night[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]B[/ch]
Screaming at the street lights[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C#m[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
All the cigarette smoke, filling up these hopeless lungs[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]                                   [ch]B[/ch]
Oh, and my head's like "What happened to, it's alright?" (What's happened?)[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C#m[/ch]
Baby, It's not alright[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
I feel like a closing window[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]                 [ch]C#m[/ch]
But I can't shake the feeling (No, I can't shake the feeling)[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]C#m[/ch]                                    [ch]A[/ch]
I   can't shake the feeling (I can't shake the feeling, my baby)[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]E[/ch]
Do you picture a better life?[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]B[/ch]
I can't seem to understand it[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]
How did we get so low?[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
No, no, no[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]B[/ch]
I can't seem to understand it[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]C#m[/ch]
But I can't shake the feeling[/tab]
(I can't seem to understand it, how did we get so low?)
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high (no, no, no)[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]C#m[/ch]
I   can't shake the feeling[/tab]
(I can't seem to understand it, how did we get so low?)
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]

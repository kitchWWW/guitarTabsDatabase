[Intro]
[ch]Eb[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab]           [ch]Eb[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
They say everything is temporary[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Eb[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
Who the hell are they anyways[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Eb[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
I wanna know where does love go to die[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]          [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
Is it some sad empty castle in the sky?[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bb[/ch]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
Did we just shoot too high and spoil like wine?[/tab]

[Chorus 1]
[tab]            [ch]Eb[/ch]                                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
You walked by and it's like our bodies never touch[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
No love, you hold me close, but I don't feel much[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
I cry, maybe time isn't on our side[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Dm[/ch]                [ch]Eb[/ch]
We had a thing, but we lost it[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Eb[/ch]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
One more go, I kinda thought if we took it slow[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Dm[/ch]                             [ch]Eb[/ch]
It might be easier for us, yeah, for us to know[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                               [ch]Bb[/ch]
I know we never been quite here before[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                       [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]Eb[/ch]
I wish I knew it when we lost it[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                            [ch]Bb[/ch]
You used to try to wake the beast in me[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Eb[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
There's still a very sleepy part of me inside[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Bb[/ch]
I've been waiting to come alive[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Eb[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
You stared into my eyes and turned to stone[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]Eb[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]
And now I'm living all alone in these four walls[/tab]

[Chorus 2]
[tab]            [ch]Eb[/ch]                        [ch]Bb[/ch]
There's a stranger, he's lying in my bed[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
Kinda blank like the thoughts living in my head[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Eb[/ch]                         [ch]Bb[/ch]
This is the one that I felt I knew so well[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]
I think we had it, but we lost it[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Eb[/ch]                                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
Still the girl that you chased all around the world[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]
I haven't changed, just replaced all the chains with pearls[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
I want the same things we did back then[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]                  [ch]Eb[/ch]
I know we had it, but we lost it[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
Oh, the bone breaks[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
It grows back stronger[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
Oh, the bone breaks[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]               [ch]Bb[/ch]
It grows back stronger[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
The bone breaks[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
It grows back stronger[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]    [ch]Eb[/ch]
Oh, the bone breaks[/tab]

[Chorus 3]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
You walked by, and it's like our bodies never touch[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
No love, you hold me close, but I don't feel much[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]

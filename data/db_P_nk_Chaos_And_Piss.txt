[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
I thought that you were driving, but you've given me the wheel.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch] 
There's rain clouds out there that you don't wanna feel.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Your anger's like a razor blade, it's just too bloody real.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                                   [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
I thought that you would be here, no I just don't get it.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Hey I also feel things more than I should.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
I don't relax very often, as often as I could.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
I worry how the whole thing looks, it doesn't look good.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                                  [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
I thought that you would be here, no I just don't get it..[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]Em[/ch]
And being clear gets too much for me, just like it does for you.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]
And even though I want to, I want to, I don't..[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
I don't feel like coming down, no I don't.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
I don't feel like hiding out, so I won't.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
I can't turn this volume down, so I sit here in this, chaos & piss,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
watching the storm passing.[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]             
Storms are beautiful, right here it's beautiful...[/tab]

I came all this way to be with you, and you're already gone..[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
If I was a good friend, I could right this wrong.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
I'd kick away your crutches and make you walk on your own.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
I really thought you'd be here, I just don't get it.[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]Em[/ch]
Though it looks warm in the rabbit hole, I could go down with you..[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
And even though I want to, I want to, I won't![/tab]

[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
I don't feel like calming down, no I don't.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]

I can't turn the volume down, so I sit here in this, chaos & piss,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
watching the storm passing, it's beautiful.[/tab]


[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
Aaahh, I'm a willow tree, you can't blow me over, [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
and my roots go deep in anger, I wanna feel the wind as it whips me like a prisoner,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
I wanna be here, I wanna be here..[/tab]

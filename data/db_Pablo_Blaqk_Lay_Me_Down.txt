Artist: Pablo Blaqk
Song: Lay Me Down
Genre: 
Key: 


This is only my second tab, I've tried to get the tab for this song for so long and I 
can't find it anywhere. It isn't perfect it's mainly just a starting point for someone to 
do it better, but hopefully it helps you out.

C, G, Am

That the general pattern he plays for the verses but he picks them, somewhat like this:

[tab]e|-------------------------------|
B|-1-------3-------1-----1-----1-|
G|-----------0-------------------|
D|---2---------------2-----2-----|
A|-3---3---2---2---0---0-----0---|
E|-------------------------------|[/tab]

     Drag my body to the sea...

For the first lay me down part I'm pretty sure it is:

Am, F, G,

The chorus or more upbeat part is similar:

C, F, G,

Though I think I'm missing a chord there it still works, play with the song and let me 
know of any errors or changes. I hope enjoy the song.

[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I once was a weaker soldier hanging in the war[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
But I left, like an ape, folded neatly in four[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And silently played for a moment slow and bled[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
On a sandalwood bust I had[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Where was the field where I had pressed another down[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
Where I had revealed myself by crying and shouting?[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I turned away from that and into this[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Black kettle of one-ness[/tab]

[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
I have not been feeling the same[/tab]
           (I have not been feeling the same)

[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
I am not fit to carry your name[/tab]
         (I am not fit to carry your name)
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
I am not fit and I am not willing[/tab]
         (I am not fit)   (I am not willing)
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
To go on...[/tab]

[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Sold, down the lane, in a way to restrain[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
You from calling a name and then regretting[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
If you save what you own you are always alone[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And then why postpone the good death?[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
We are those who break laws when the cold body thaws[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Who prefer breaking jaws but must lower ourselves[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
Unfit though we are to help you get very far[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Still we would never mar your rightful due[/tab]

[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
I have not been feeling the same[/tab]
           (I have not been feeling the same)

[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
I am not fit to carry your name[/tab]
         (I am not fit to carry your name)
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
I am not fit and I am not willing[/tab]
         (I am not fit)   (I am not willing)
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
To go on...[/tab]

[Verse 3]

[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
It was noon before she moved into the yards and pressed her hair[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
With a hand yellowed, smooth, and shaking[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
She had pulled on a housedress over nothing but her skin[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
And stood in the grass looking about her[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You breathe in here, and you've breathed of me[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
My girl here, she loves you, she'll take you upstairs[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Call on me later, much later in life[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
But do me a favor and leave her up there[/tab]

[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]

[Chorus]

[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
I am not feeling the same[/tab]
     (I have not been feeling the same)

[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
I am not willing to carry your name[/tab]
         (I am not fit to carry your name)
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
I am not here and I am not going[/tab]
         (I am not fit)   (I am not willing)
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
To be there...[/tab]
(To go on...)

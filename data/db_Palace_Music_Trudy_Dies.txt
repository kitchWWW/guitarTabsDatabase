A bird in my ear
Was beaking away
About all the jewels
He'd come across that day
Jewels in the grass
Jewels in the grass
Where the worms used to be
Where the worms used to be

The cattle were lowing
They cried for your feet
The clouds were your arches
The cows were asleep
And they spoke of you
They spoke of you
As they lay there and moo
As they lay there and moo

The house walls are tighter
The bed it is small
Housing just one soul
Just one soul at all
Where it once held two
It once held two
Now it doesn't hold you
Now it doesn't hold you

The ride and I won't be
Towards working today
That's good, that's over
You are away
And now I'll undo
Now I'll undo
That's just what I'll do
That's just what I'll do

End on E

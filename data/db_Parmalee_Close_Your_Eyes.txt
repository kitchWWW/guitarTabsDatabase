Well take a look at what's left in that sunset,[/tab]
Fireflies popping like the Fourth of July, yeah.
You're gonna wanna see every single thing I'm gonna show you tonight.
Got the perfect scene set of a moonlight glowing,
Just keep them baby blues wide open.
Girl take a look around, yeah it's going down.
It's going down just right.

Hey baby fore the night gets any older,
Lean your pretty self over here a little closer.
I need to hold ya,
I wanna show ya what you don't wanna miss, no.
It's all getting to what we've been waiting on.
I'm gonna go and turn you and the night on.
Coming on strong, I'm gonna lay it on your lips.
Might wanna close your eyes for this.

Sun gone down, nights are getting hotter.
We've got this bed backed up to the water.
Yeah it's the place to be if you wanna see every little shining star.
But that view ain't nothing like the you I'm lookin at,
Two tan legs for days dangling off the back.
It all looks better baby you can see forever when you're here in my arms.

Hey baby fore the night gets any older,
Lean your pretty self over here a little closer.
I need to hold ya,
I wanna show ya what you don't wanna miss, no.
It's all getting to what we've been waiting on.
I'm gonna go and turn you and the night on.
Coming on strong, I'm gonna lay it on your lips.
Might wanna close your eyes for this.

Just when you thought you had seen it all,[/tab]
Well it turns out you don't have to see it all.

Hey baby fore the night gets any older,
Lean your pretty self over here a little closer.

It's all getting to what we've been waiting on.
I'm gonna go and turn you and the night on.
Coming on strong, I'm gonna lay it on your lips.
Might wanna close your eyes for this.
Might wanna close your eyes for this.
Hey pretty girl might wanna close your eyes for this.
Close your eyes for this.

Always Midnight

Intro:  [ch]B[/ch], [ch]A[/ch]


[tab][ch]E[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
Seems like it's Always Midnight,[/tab]
Sweeping up broken glass after every fight
With the sound of a train
that I could've been on
Reminding me that the last one's gone.
With you,
It's always midnight.

[tab]         [ch]C#m[/ch]
Are you blind?[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]B[/ch]
Can't you see me standing here[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
waiting in line?[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
For you.[/tab]
Are you mine?
Not just when you wanna be
all of the time?
Are you?
Are you blind?
Don't you see me standing here
Won't you tell me what it is
I'm waiting to find..?
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
You're right,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]B[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
I must be crazy.[/tab]
You're out getting high,
I'm here pretending I'm in love.
The sound of your heart,
my head on your chest,
dropped your hands to your sides
and gave up.
I'd rather be crazy than right
Tonight

Are you blind?
Can't you see me standing here
waiting in line?
For you.
Are you mine?
Not just when you wanna be
all of the time?
Are you?
Are you blind?
Don't you see me standing here
Won't you tell me what it is
I'm waiting to find..?

[tab][ch]B[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
A way to get back to you,[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
A way to get out of here,[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
I don't want to be alone[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]
At midnight anymore.[/tab]
How do I get away
Wanna see you in the daylight
I don't wanna be afraid of
Midnight anymore

With the sound of a train
That I should have been on
reminding me that the last one's gone.
With you,
There's always midnight..

Are you blind?
Can't you see me standing here
waiting in line?
For you.
Are you mine?
Not just when you wanna be
all of the time?
Are you?
Are you blind?
Don't you see me standing here
Won't you tell me what it is
I'm waiting to find..?
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]
With you,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
It's Always Midnight...[/tab]

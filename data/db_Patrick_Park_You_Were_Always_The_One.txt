Artist: Patrick Park
Song: You Were Always The One
Genre: 
Key: 


You Were Always The One from Patrick's fabulous Album 'Come What Will'

Capo 2nd Fret

This was worked out from the video
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p61ouMHwp84

I thinks its pretty much spot on but there could be the odd mistake. Feel free to take 
it and change it if you feel this is the case

For the hammer-on's in the intro and verses he plays this

[tab]e----------|
b----------|
g--2-------|   If you dont fancy the stretch to the fith fret then you could
d--2h4-----|   play a regular open D chord and hammer-on from open to the
a--5-------|   2nd fret of the high e string with your middle finger tog get
E----------|   the f# to g# just in a higher register.[/tab]


Also in the intro and verses, there is a quick change between three chords, Bm-Bsus4-D, 
which goes like this

[tab]e--------2--|
b--3--2--3--|  I find it easy to just lay my first finger flat on the
g--4--4--2--|  fret board to get the 2nd fret on the b string, or you could
d--4--4--0--|  move your first finger down to play it and not play the root
a--2--2-----|  on the a string, its more important to play the 2nd fret b
E-----------|  string to get the right sound.[/tab]

Verse
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch](hammer-on) [ch]A[/ch]
I've been stuck in my ways[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]Bsus4[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
I've been rolling through days[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Always afraid that things might get better[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch](hammer-on)          [ch]A[/ch]
I've been travelling down this road[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]Bsus4[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Living free i suppose[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
All the while feeling tired and teathered[/tab]

Chorus
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]
And i don't understand why i play these games[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
And i trade the truth for lies[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
Cos' you were always the one i was looking for babe[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
It just took time to realise[/tab]

Interlude

[ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]

2nd verse ( same as first )

I've slummed it away
On the brightest of days
Always had trouble keeping on the level

And i made a big show
Of letting you go
God knows i was some kind of devil

2nd Chorus ( same as first )

Bridge
[tab]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
It's the hardest thing by far[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
To see who we are[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
And then let the whole thing go[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
And float like the leaves[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]D/C#[/ch]   [ch]Bm[/ch]
That hang on the wind[/tab]
[ch]G[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch](hammer-on) [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] 
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]Bsus4[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Whichever way it blows[/tab]

[ch]D[/ch](hammer-on) [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]Bsus4[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

Third verse ( same as the first 2 )

Now mistakes its true
I've made more than a few
And i'm going to make many others

And it's hard to see why
We go through this sometimes
All the things that we do to each other

Final chorus ( same as the first 2 )

Outro

[ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]


As i said, i think this is pretty much there but if there is something that needs 
changing, go ahead and change it.

Please rate, thanks.

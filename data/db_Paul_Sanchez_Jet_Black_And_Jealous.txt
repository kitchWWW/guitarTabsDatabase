Intro: [ch]C[/ch]

Verses:
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
You read the entire works of T.H. White[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
And I never asked you any questions[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
and you looked just like a movie queen last night[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
so I didn't mind the extra waiting[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
but you beat my arms with your slashing tongue[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
and it was no fun for me in fact[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
it was black, jet black and jealous[/tab]

(all verses the same.  On last verse, when final line is repeated
 3 times, insert Bm between each repeated line so it is G A D Bm).

Bridge:
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
There's a blind rage building you can't control[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
you suck in hot air that comes out cold[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
you're building a cage that surrounds your soul[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
and pulls you down, deeper down[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
down, down, deeper dow - n[/tab]

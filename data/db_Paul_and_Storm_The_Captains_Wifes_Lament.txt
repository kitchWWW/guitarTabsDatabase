[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                            [ch]Gm[/ch]               
The ship sailed into harbor after fifteen months at sea[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
The captain hit the tavern with his crew of fifty-three[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                               [ch]Gm[/ch]
After drinking up their pay they staggered through the town[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                                        [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]Dm[/ch]  
But all the inns and public houses turned the sailors down[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                                  [ch]Gm[/ch]               
The captain said "Fear not, me lads you all can come with me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
I live just 'round the corner, and you all can stay for free"[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                              [ch]Gm[/ch]               
But when the captain's wife awoke upon the break of day[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                                            [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]Dm[/ch]  
They say that you could hear her wailin' Clear to Bot'ny Bay...[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
She said there's seamen all around the bed and seamen on the floor[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
Seamen in the bathroom and behind the closet door[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]F#[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]F#[/ch]
there's seamen in the fireplace and seamen in the hall[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
The living room is carpeted with seamen, wall to wall[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
there's seamen in the entryway and seamen on the stair[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
And worst of all, there's even seamen in me underwear[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]F#[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]F#[/ch]
there's some behind the larder and beneath the table, too[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
I do believe your seamen got into me Irish stew[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
there's seamen here in front of me and seamen in the rear[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
My God, there's even seamen hanging from the chandelier[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]F#[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]F#[/ch]
there's seamen on the windowsill and seamen in the yard[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
The seamen even left a stain upon the Saint Bernard[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch] 
Although I am a patient wife 'tis more than I can bear[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
To wake up in the morning with your seamen in my hair[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
I ne'er again do wish to see thee darken up my door[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
So clean up all your seamen and come round my way no more[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
So clean up all your seamen and come round my way no more![/tab]

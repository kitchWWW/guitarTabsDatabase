During the intro and outro when a D chord or A chord is played, halfway through playing it Neil puts a
finger on the 3rd fret of the high E string, you can hear this in the song pretty clearly.

Not too sure about the outro, you can just play the chorus chords a few times, but if you are playing under
the lead guitar, what I put sounds about right.

Also, the N.C. in the chorus could just be played as a D, but in the video they do a pause.

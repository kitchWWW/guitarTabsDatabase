[Intro]
[ch]A[/ch]   [ch]B7[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                             [ch]B7[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Camilla, I'm at home alone just staring at my phone for you to write[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                                [ch]B7[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
I'm laying singled in my bed just stoned out of my head this Friday night[/tab]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Oh, Camilla, you don't understand I haven't left my room[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
In a couple days, even though you might think that I'd want to[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
When you're scrolling by you might be thinking that it's me you see[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
But it's not really[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                             [ch]B7[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Camilla, I'm at home instead just circling my head don't ask me why[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                                  [ch]B7[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I'm really making such a fuss, been feeling rather off so don't come by[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
And it always folds in blue[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
While I'm leaning into chocolate[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
But a vision of it holds me very still[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
  I don't even think it's real[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Oh, Camilla, you don't understand I haven't left my room[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
In a couple days, even though you might think that I want to[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
When you're scrolling by you might be thinking that it's me you see[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
But it's not really[/tab]

[ch]A[/ch]  [ch]B7[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
And it always folds in blue[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
While I'm leaning into chocolate[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
But a vision of it holds me very still[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
 I don't even think it's real[/tab]

Oh, we worked and we fought for the little that's ours[/tab]

And we're not gonna give it back[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]G7[/ch]
While you ride around in a Rolls Royce car[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]
And we're not gonna give it back[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C7[/ch]                                             [ch]C[/ch]
You take away our bread and butter while you're drinking wine[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]F7[/ch]
And you send out the cops against the picket line[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]G7[/ch]
You tried it before but I swear this time[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]G7[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
We're not gonna give it back[/tab]

Well, you want our wages and our benefits too
But we're not gonna give it back
To make less for us and more for you
And we're not gonna give it back
Your profits are higher than they've ever been
The economy's a mess 'cos you're greedy as sin
And you never will care what shape we're in
And we're not gonna give it back

Chorus

We won the right to bargain and the right to strike
And we're not gonna give it back
Now you think you can cancel them whenever you like
And we're not gonna give it back
Listen while I tell you 'bout the rich and poor
It's what my momma told me all about the class war
And it's mighty plain to see what the union's for
And we're not gonna give it back

Chorus

It's the same old story 'bout the wealthy few
Getting rich off the worker's back
You divide us up by giving jobs to two
While another two get the sack
Up to now you've had your ride for free
But we'll put a picket line around the whole country
And we'll set up a banner for the world to see
That says you're never gonna get it back

End-Chorus x 2:
No you're never gonna get it back
You're never gonna get it back
You're never gonna get it back, no fear
You're never gonna get it back

[Intro]
(Barre all chords and slide down)
I, your name, do solemnly swear not to off myself,

think about offing myself, or continue thinking

about offing myself without reaching out for help,

after listening to this song.


[Verse 1]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Sometimes I see them on the sidewalk[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Biking on the wet chalk[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E7[/ch]
Spelling out their name,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E7[/ch]
And I feel insane[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
'Cause I know it's just a game,[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
that I'm playing with my brain[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
I don't see her but I see her[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And I know it isn't real[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
But I fake it anyway[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
Pull a smile and wave[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E7[/ch]
Nod and look away[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E7[/ch]
Wait for it to fade,[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
But it happens all the time,[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
And people say it's fine,[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
My roomate says they're killing us[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
But they're killing themselves[/tab]

And I'm surrounded by the


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Dead girls,[/tab]

On the road
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]
dead girls,[/tab]

On my phone
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Dead girls,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
Where do they go?[/tab]

All of the fuckin'
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Dead girls[/tab]

All around,
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]
Dead girls[/tab]

In my town
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Dead girls,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
I wanna know[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
and it'd be wrong to say I miss them,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]E7[/ch]
I didn't really know them[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]
I just have a couple friends[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
who say they knew them well[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
They seemed like something special,[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]E7[/ch]
Really don't they all?[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
I guess before you're gone[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
It can be kind of hard to tell[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I broke the fuckin' news,[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]E7[/ch]
It wasn't mine to break,[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
I cried and I was empty[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
And I didn't know what to say[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Dead kid,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
With my friend,[/tab]
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]
Dead kid,[/tab]
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]
Home again,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Dead kids,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
I wanna go[/tab]

With the
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Dead girls,[/tab]

In the sky,
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]
Dead girls,[/tab]

In your eyes,
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Dead girls,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
I wanna go[/tab]

But it's fucking
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
dead girls all around[/tab]

dead girls from my town
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]
dead girls[/tab]

where do they go
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]
I wanna be a dead girl[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
like my friend[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
dead girl[/tab]

home again
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
dead girl[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I don't know[/tab]

Since the day you took this love
I often stop to wonder just what youre thinking of

Now it's me in control
Got no heart but got this feeling in my soul

Forever
I'll hate you forever
I'll hate you forever
I'll hate you forever

Girl you know you had your great stuff
you've been with alotta guys 
and I've been with alotta women 
infact I've been with a hell of alotta women! 
but thats not the point 
were talking bout you not me 
see you coulda been at the top of my list 
but theres just one problem 
you just a trickass ho!

Forever
I'll hate you forever 
I'll hate you forever
I'll hate you forever

And those lines in your face tell the tragic story
of late nights and heart breaks 
but youre drunk sorry 
so I look a little trip 
but those thoughts came to slow 
never realizin that you'll always be a ho!

Forever
I'll hate you forever
I'll hate you forever
I'll hate you forever

I'll hate you...

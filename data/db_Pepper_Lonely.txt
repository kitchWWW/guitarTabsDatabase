(the walk up goes A-B-C)

D               A
Tired and confused
C                                      G
Well, now you're running from the west
D                        A
Yes, your heart, it's so abused
C                              G
But does your mind need a rest?

Oh darling

D                         A
I wouldn't cry, it might make a flood
C                           G
And I don't know if I can swim that good
D                          A
No, I wouldn't cry, that might make a flood
C                           G
And I don't know if I can swim that good

D                 A
I've been lonely, only
C                          G
When I stop to think about you
D                            A
So I don't stop, I just keep on
C                             G
Trying to keep my head above these blues

D                        A
Yeah, we're down here in Rome
C                         G
But we're longing to come home
D                          A
You know the last train is gone
C                            G
You know the last bird has flown

D                         A
I wouldn't cry, it might make a flood
C                           G
And I don't know if I can swim that good
D                          A
No, I wouldn't cry, that might make a flood
C                           G
And I don't know if I can swim that good


D                 A
I've been lonely, only
C                          G
When I stop to think about you
D                            A
So I don't stop, I just keep on
C                             G
Trying to keep my head above these blues 


A                                   G
I keep my head cooled down and woman, I'd fall out
A                             G
If that gets me back there to you
A                       C
So I keep my head above when things start to get rough
A                           G                   
Your picture's never, never, never, never

D                 A
I've been lonely, only
C                          G
When I stop to think about you
D                            A
So I don't stop, I just keep on
C                             G
Trying to keep my head above these blues x3


D             A
Last train is gone
C                             G
You know the last bird has flown

Hey Pete Murray fans! I'm not normally a tabber but the chord diagrams that were on here
I posted this seemed very wrong, and I wanted to learn the song so I played around and
out the intro/verse riff. Still haven't got around to figuring out the chorus, and 
me I'll forget, so for the benefit of those who want a starting point in learning this
I thought I'd just post up what I had so far. Enjoy!

[[ch]Bb[/ch]] And if you had questions about [[ch]C/Bb[/ch]] sheep or flowers [[ch]Am7[/ch]] or dogs [[ch]C/D[/ch]]
You'd just ask the [[ch]Bb[/ch]/[ch]C[/ch]] saddler
He lived without [[ch]C7[/ch]] sin... they're [[ch]C7sus4[/ch]] building a library for him

[[ch]F[/ch]] Time is a traveller, Tenterfield saddler [[ch]Bb[/ch]/[ch]C[/ch]] turn your [[ch]C7[/ch]] head
[[ch]C7sus4[/ch]] Ride again jackaroo [[ch]Gm7[/ch]] think I see [[ch]C7sus4[/ch]] kanga [[ch]F[/ch]] roo up ahead

[[ch]F[/ch]] The son of George Woolnough [[ch]C/E[/ch]] went off and got married [[ch]Dm[/ch]] and had a war baby
[[ch]Bb[/ch]] Though something was wrong and [[ch]F[/ch]/[ch]A[/ch]] it's easier to drink than [[ch]C[/ch]] go crazy
[[ch]Bb[/ch]] And if there was questions about [[ch]C/Bb[/ch]] why the end [[ch]Am7[/ch]] was so [[ch]Dm7[/ch]] sad,
Well George had [[ch]C7sus4[/ch]] no answers about [[ch]C7[/ch]] why a son
[[ch]C7sus4[/ch]] ever has need [[ch]F[/ch]] of a gun

[[ch]F[/ch]] Time is a traveller, Tenterfield saddler [[ch]Gm7[/ch]] turn [[ch]C7sus4[/ch]] your head [[ch]Gm7[/ch]] [[ch]C7[/ch]]
[[ch]Gm7[/ch]] Ride again [[ch]C7[/ch]] jackaroo [[ch]Gm7[/ch]] think I [[ch]C7[/ch]] see kanga [[ch]F[/ch]] roo up ahead [Cm7/F]

[[ch]F[/ch]] The grandson of George has [[ch]C[/ch]] been all around
[[ch]A7[/ch]/[ch]C#[/ch]]   the world and lives in no [[ch]Dm[/ch]] special place
[[ch]Bb[/ch]] Changed his last name and [[ch]F[/ch]/[ch]C[/ch]] he married a girl with an [[ch]C/E[/ch]] interesting face
[[ch]Bb[/ch]] He'd almost forgotten [[ch]C/Bb[/ch]] them both
Because in [[ch]Am7[/ch]] the life that he [[ch]Dm7[/ch]] leads
[tab]There's nowhere [[ch]C7sus4[/ch]] for George and [[ch]C7[/ch]] his library or the son with his [[ch]Dm7[/ch]/[ch]A[/ch]] gun 
to belong[/tab]
[[ch]Gm7[/ch]] Except in [[ch]C7sus4[/ch]] this song

[[ch]F[/ch]] Time is a traveller, Tenterfield saddler [[ch]Gm7[/ch]] turn [[ch]C7[/ch]] your [[ch]Gm7[/ch]] head [[ch]C7[/ch]]
[[ch]Gm7[/ch]] Ride again [[ch]C7[/ch]] jackaroo think I see [[ch]F[/ch]] kangaroo up [[ch]Gm7[/ch]] ahead [[ch]C7[/ch]]

The late George Woolnough worked on high street and lived on manners

Fifty two years he sat on his verandah and made his saddles

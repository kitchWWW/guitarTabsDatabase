Artist: Peter Gabriel
Song: In Your Eyes
Genre: 
Key: 


Ok, there were no bass tabs out there for this song, and the one's I could find were
way off or made too difficult.  This is a great slow song with some notes hitting harder
others.  So I made this tab real easy just accenting the heavier notes, and keeping 
with the song.. that's all you need to do as the bass player, especially for this song.
great acoustic or full band..  please rate!  (remember just hit these notes once each 
let them ring out.. you will feel it and know when)

CHORUS

there really is no strumming going on here, just pluck and let the note ring out and
the change.  Once again just really accenting notes here and adding some bass.  Nothing too
with this song.  It sounds good though, and gets the job done.  Please rate and let me 
if you have any questions/comments.  Thanks

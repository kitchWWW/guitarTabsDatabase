[tab] [ch]Dm[/ch]
Sunday morning, very bright,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
I read Your book by colored light[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm7[/ch]                  [ch]E7[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
That came in through the pretty window picture.[/tab]


VERSE:
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
I visited some houses where they said that You were living[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A7[/ch]
And they talked a lot about You[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
And they spoke about Your giving.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
They passed a basket with some envelopes[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Bm7[/ch]
I just had time to write a note[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E7[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]Em7[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
And all it said was "I believe in You."[/tab]


VERSE:
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
Passing conversations where they mentioned Your existence[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A7[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
And the fact that You had been replaced by Your assistants.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
The discussion was theology,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
And when they smiled and turned to me[/tab]
[tab] [ch]E[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]Em7[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]Em7[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
All that I could say was "I believe in You."[/tab]


VERSE:
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]Amaj7[/ch]
I visited Your house again on Christmas or Thanksgiving[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A7[/ch]
And a balded man said You were dead,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
But the house would go on living.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
He recited poetry and as he saw me stand to leave[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]A7[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
He shook his head and said "I'd never find You."[/tab]


OUTRO:
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
My mother used to dress me up,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
And while my dad was sleeping[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
We would walk down to Your house without speaking.[/tab]

[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
There are places I should be.[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
I often tell myself.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Another person I should be,[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
A life of someone else.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
When I am older,[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]E[/ch]
I hope I learn what life’s about.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
‘Cause when I was younger,[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]E[/ch]
I swore I had it all figured out.[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
And weather’s changing[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]D[/ch]
Leaves have scattered on the ground[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
A cold wind’s blowing[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
The wails of winter bearing down.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
I think about you and me[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]E[/ch]
When we were seventeen[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
Ignorant and innocent[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]E[/ch]
Full of hope, full of dreams.[/tab]



[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Aadd9[/ch]                                                    [ch]Dsus2[/ch]
All those days...(And the highs and surprises)... follow me...(And the lows that follow)...[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bsus2[/ch]                                                                   [ch]E[/ch]
Like a welcomed chain...(All the way to the bottom)...  pulling back on me...(All the way to the ghosts)...[/tab]
[tab][ch]Aadd9[/ch]                                                       [ch]Dsus2[/ch]
All those days...(But the spark in the shallow)...  fall on me...(And the will that followed)...[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bsus2[/ch]                                                                         [ch]E[/ch]
Like a heavy weight...(Brought you back to the surface)... Ain’t life a mystery...(And even more in tomorrow).[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Every note is more precise[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
As always should have been.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Every word is more sincere[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Though cynically swollen.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
And some days roll out the storm clouds[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]E[/ch]
And thoughtless words that cut like a knife[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
But through the gray and back,[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]E[/ch]
I’ve always loved you more than life.[/tab]


[Chorus 2]

[tab][ch]Aadd9[/ch]                                                    [ch]Dsus2[/ch]
All those days...(And the highs and surprises)... follow me...(And the lows that follow)...[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bsus2[/ch]                                                                   [ch]E[/ch]
Like a welcomed chain...(All the way to the bottom)...  pulling back on me...(All the way to the ghosts)...[/tab]
[tab][ch]Aadd9[/ch]                                                       [ch]Dsus2[/ch]
All those days...(But the spark in the shallow)...  fall on me...(And the will that followed)...[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bsus2[/ch]                                                                         [ch]E[/ch]
Like a heavy weight...(Brought you back to the surface)... Ain’t life a mystery...(And even more in tomorrow).[/tab]

All those days...(And the highs and surprises)... follow me...(And the lows that follow)...[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bsus2[/ch]                                                                   [ch]E[/ch]
Like a welcomed chain...(All the way to the bottom)...  pulling back on me...(All the way to the ghosts)...[/tab]
[tab][ch]Aadd9[/ch]                                                       [ch]Dsus2[/ch]
All those days...(But the spark in the shallow)...  fall on me...(And the will that followed)...[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bsus2[/ch]                                                                         [ch]E[/ch]
Like a heavy weight...(Brought you back to the surface)... Ain’t life a mystery...(And even more in tomorrow).[/tab]

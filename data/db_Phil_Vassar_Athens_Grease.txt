Phil Vassar - Athens Grease
[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
If you're headin' south on Georgia one twenty-nine[/tab]
Straight into Athens past the Clark County line
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]                                            [ch]A[/ch]
There's an old Texaco right across from the Athens Woolworth[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Billy Joe Taylor's underneath that lift[/tab]
There ain't a car on the planet that he can't fix
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                                                    [ch]A[/ch]
He swears on his chrome-plated ratchet that his heaven on earth[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
Well, he can make a rusty muffler purr like a kitten[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Or an old Nash Rambler top out at one-fifty[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]
Georgia's never seen a man more at peace[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
Than when Billy's got his hands in[/tab]
Athen's Grease

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Six days a week, he's a man on a mission[/tab]
He's the redneck Picasso of the manual transmission
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                                                  [ch]A[/ch]
And the only man in town who can make Charlie Vincent's van go[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
When the sun goes down and the day is endin'[/tab]
Billy's still rockin' with a rack and pinion
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                               [ch]A[/ch]
Long as that boy's at work, well he's right at home[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
Well, he's a rotatin,' lug nuttin,'[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
Spark pluggin' good ole boy[/tab]
With his name on his shirt
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
And Thelma Lou Taylor likes to hang out at the station[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]
'Cause she loves to watch him work[/tab]
Back to Chorus
After Chorus
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]
Yeah, Georgia's never seen a man more at peace[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
Than when Billy's got his hands in[/tab]
Athen's Grease
Athen's grease, baby

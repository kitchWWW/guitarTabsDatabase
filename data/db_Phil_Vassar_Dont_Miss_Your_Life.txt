[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D/F#[/ch]
On a plane to the West Coast, laptop on my tray[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Papers spread across my seat, a big deadline to make[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
An older man sitting next to me said, "Sorry to intrude,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
Thirty years ago my busy friend, I was you.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I made a ton of money and I climbed up the ladder,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, I was superman, not what does it matter.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
I missed the first steps my daughter took[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
The time my son played Captain Hook in 'Peter Pan'[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
I was in New York, said 'Sorry son, Dad has to work'[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I missed the father daughter dance[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
The first home run, no second chance[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
To be there when he crossed the plate[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
The moment's gone now it's too late[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
Fame and fortune come with a heavy price[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D/G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
Son, don't miss your life."[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
Funny you should say that, I was sitting at the gate[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                                  [ch]D[/ch]
My daughter called, she made straight A's and they're off to celebrate.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
Scrolling through the pictures of my little family[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
My daughter with her mom and friends, not a single one with me.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
They know I love 'em, I know they know I care[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
The truth is half the time, I'm not even there.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
I missed our fourth and fifth anniversary[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
Our girl was early by a week[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
Her sister had to hold her hand[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
I was in L.A., she said "I understand"[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I missed her first day of school[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Then what kind of crazy fool[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
Lets such precious moments pass[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
We all know time goes way too fast[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
Hold on tight â€˜cause it don't happen twice [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
Don't miss your life.[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C/E[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
When I get off this plane, I'll buy a turn-around ticket[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C/E[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Saturday's her eighth birthday and I'm not gonna miss it[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                  
There'll be balloons and birthday cake[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
And I'll clean up the mess they make[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
My mom and dad are drivin' in[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
I haven't seen 'em in God knows when[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
My wife will probably say to me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
"I thought you were supposed to be in Portland[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
For a few more days", I'll take her in my arms and say[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
"I heard some words that hit me hard last night,[/tab]
                                      G---
A man said: 'Don't miss your life'."

[Verse]

[tab][ch]C5[/ch]
He left Maine 'cause he needed a change[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And he was desperate to rearrange[/tab]
[tab][ch]F5[/ch]
priorities, And he thought the sea[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G5[/ch]
Would be the best place to be[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
So he saved his money, sold his car[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And with his eye set on a Southern star[/tab]
[tab][ch]F5[/ch]
Got the courage to follow his heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]G5[/ch]
Set out for a brand new start[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
He's an island boy[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
Now he's an island boy[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Living his life where stress is the enemy[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
Now he's an island boy[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
A stone's throw from St. Croix[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Dm7[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]Dm7[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
He's finally found his piece of serenity[/tab]


[Verse]

[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
Now he tends bar at the Old Mango[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
And he sees tourists come and go[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]
With their pressed pants and camera case[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Too much sun burned on their face[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
Now he watches the snow on CNN[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
With all of his dope-smokin' friends[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Just look at the hell they must be in[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Swears he won't go back again[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
He's an island boy[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
Now he's an island boy[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Living his life where stress is the enemy[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
Now he's an island boy[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
A stone's throw from St. Croix[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]Dm7[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
He's finally found his piece of serenity[/tab]


[Bridge]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
You know the love of his life has always been Emily[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
She loves the man she sees[/tab]

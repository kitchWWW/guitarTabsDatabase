                              VERSE 2:
Friday, you're late. I guess we'll never make our dinner-date at the 
restaraunt, you start to cry. Baby we'll just improvise. Plan B looks like 
Domino's pizza in the candlelight, then we'll tippy-toe to our room, make a 
little love that's overdue. But somebody had a bad dream. 'Mama amd Daddy, 
can me and my teddy come in and sleep in-between?'

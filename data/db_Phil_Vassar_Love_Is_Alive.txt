[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]A[/ch]
One hundred miles till I get home, and I can't wait to get you alone[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
And hold you as close as I can get, you think you've been loved, you haven't been yet[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
Feel your hair against my skin, it takes me somewhere I've never been[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Girl, I love you, you love me, we carved it on the willow tree[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
And love, love is a- live tonight[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Love is alive, love is alive tonight[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]A[/ch]
Your mama likes me, your daddy does too, he likes this cross on my tattoo[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
Re- minds him of when he was younger, I'm starving, girl, with this hunger[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
I can't ever satisfy, it's burning me up deep inside[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
And I can't get enough of this, I need a long forever kiss[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
And love, love is a- live tonight[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Love is alive, love is alive tonight[/tab]

[Bridge 1]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
Love tells the truth, it never lies, it never looks for alibis[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
It's smaller than a baby's touch, it's bigger than the both of us ---[/tab]

[Bridge 2]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                    [ch]F#m/C#[/ch]
Girl, you're deep inside of me, where I thought no one could ever be[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Can't wait a minute longer, can you feel it getting stronger[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
And love, love is a- live tonight[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Love is alive, love is alive tonight[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                                           [ch]A[/ch]
Yeah, it's bigger than the whole, wide world, and it's in you, and in me, girl[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
Love is black, and love is white, it's never wrong, it's always right[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
It's a candle you can't hide, and it's a roller coaster ride[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah, love is alive, ooh[/tab]

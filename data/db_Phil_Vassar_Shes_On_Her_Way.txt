[Verse]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]
He said, Is this your first, and I said, Yes, sir[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
I smiled and I said, We just had a girl[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]
He said, Oh, boy, just like me, you're a fortunate one[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
He said, Girls, they're different, and I ought to know[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
I've got three myself, but they're all grown[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]
You're in for the ride of your life, just enjoy it, son[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]F#m[/ch]                      [ch]C#m[/ch]
There's gonna be first words, gonna be first dates[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
You'll think she's perfect, but she'll make mistakes[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]C#m[/ch]
So be there to listen, and be there to talk[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
And learn to let go when it's her time to walk[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]C#m[/ch]
And she's on her way, she's on her own[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
Just yesterday, you were bringing her home[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]C#m[/ch]
You'll watch her fall down, you'll watch her grow up[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bm[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
She'll meet somebody, and she'll fall in love[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
Hear what I say, there will come a day[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
When she's on her way[/tab]


[tab][ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
Holding her hand, you'll feel like a king[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
It's hard to say no to your little queen[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
And the sweetest words you'll ever hear are, 'I love you, Dad'[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]E[/ch]
Sometimes, you're gonna wonder if you're getting it right[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
But as long as you love her, she'll be just fine[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bm[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]
Smiles turn to tears, back to smiles at the drop of a hat[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
Her knees will get skinned, her heart'll get broke[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
The years will go fast, some nights will go slow[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]C#m[/ch]
Boy, honor her mother, whatever you do[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]
'Cause the worth of a man, she'll take that from you[/tab]

[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]C#m[/ch]
And she's on her way, she's on her own[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]
Just yesterday, you were bringing her home[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]C#m[/ch]
You'll watch her fall down, you'll watch her grow up[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
She'll meet somebody, and she'll fall in love[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
Hear what I say, there will come a day[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]
When she's on her way[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
Off to school, down the drive[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]
Ponytail waves goodbye[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
She's the light and the love of your life[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Bm[/ch]
And then there's cars, and there's boys[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#m[/ch]
All made up, no more toys[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]
One day, she's somebody's wife[/tab]

[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]C#m[/ch]
And she's on her way, she's on her own[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
Just yesterday, you were bringing her home[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]C#m[/ch]
You'll watch her fall down, you'll watch her grow up[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
She'll meet somebody, and she'll fall in love[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]
Hear what I say, there will come a day[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
When she's on her way[/tab]

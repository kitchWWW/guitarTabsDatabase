[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
All the girls at the office went every year[/tab]

They'd come back with secrets and cheap souvenirs
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                         [ch]G[/ch]
They'd beg her to go. They'd say you don't know what your missin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But her boyfriend Bobby was a class A jerk.[/tab]

Never let her go nowhere, treated her like dirt
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                     [ch]G[/ch]
But this time they convinced her, she didn't need his permission[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]C[/ch]
But as soon as that plane got up in the air[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
They all raised their glasses and they all made her swear[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
What happens in Vegas is just between us[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Ain't nobody's business what anyone does[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
You can let down your hair be as wild as you dare[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Go crazy do something outrageous[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
But what happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
They were all flyin High when they got off the plane[/tab]
Went straight to their rooms and everyone changed
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
Looked so different from work[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]D[/ch]
wearing short skirts and flirtin with strangers[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
She felt like Cinderella[/tab]
She was havin a ball
Met a doctor from Dallas
They laughed and made talk
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
Then a voice in her ear whispered Bobby ain't here[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]D[/ch]
And there ain't no ring on your finger, Remember[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
There was one empty seat comin home on that plane[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
Bobby was waitin at the baggage claim[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
He said, "Where the Hell is she?"[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
But all they would say, is[/tab]

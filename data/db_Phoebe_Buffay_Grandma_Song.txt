[Verse] 
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]          
Now grandma's a person who everyone likes[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
She brought you a train and a bright shiny bike[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch] 
But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]
And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Now your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
But the truth is she died and someday you will too[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
La-la-la-la-la[/tab]

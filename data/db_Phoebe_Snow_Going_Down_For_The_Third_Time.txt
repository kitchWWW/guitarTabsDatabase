Going Down For The Third Time 
Phoebe Snow 

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I'm goin' down, down for the third time[/tab]
I'm goin' down, down for the third time
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Drownin' in tears from my heart that's hurtin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Drownin' in tears from a love that's uncertain[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
     I'm lost in a world without your love[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
     A sea of emptiness[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                         
     The love we knew is bein' washed away[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                                   [ch]E[/ch]              
     Don't think I can last, my heart is sinkin' fast[/tab]

I'm goin' down, down for the third time
Tryin' to hold on to a love that's gone
Drownin' in the love that keeps me breathin'
Drownin' in the fear that my arms you're leavin'

     Bring back that love we knew
     And let me live again
     A little tenderness to me start showin'
     Fill my heart with love till it's overflowin'

        [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]-[ch]E[/ch]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Like a ship all alone on a ragin' sea[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
You got me tossin' and a-turnin' and I can't get free[/tab]

     Reach out your hand for me
     Save what's left of our love
     I'll forgive your lies and alibis
     If you'll wipe my cryin' eyes

I'm goin' down, for the third time
So won't you save this heart of mine
I've loved too long, I love too strong
Now little boy you know you're doin' me wrong

     Come on and save me
     Come on and save me (down, down, down, down)
     Save me, save me
     (Don't let her drown, drown, drown, drown)

Drowning...
(I'm goin down, down, down, down)
(Don't let her drown, drown, drown, drown)

Phosphorescent - A Picture of Our Torn Up Praise

[Intro]
[ch]E[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                                        
I don't want to take and baby, I don't want to break and baby[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
  I don't want to try and make you anyway[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                            
I just want to lie down, tell my crazy brains to lie down [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]        
And then fall away[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                                        
I won't be alone, I won't be waiting by the phone[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch] 
I won't be dreaming of you dreaming of me anyway[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                                       
Tell me where you've been and I will tell you where I've been [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
It will be all okay[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
Eee[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                                              
I don't have a home, it's not a chain, it's not a throne [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
It's just a picture of a picture tossed and torn away[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                                        
Of anger on your face still not as strange and not as brave [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
As when you turned away[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                                         
I won't be the one when all is said and all is done [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
I won't be breathing like you breathe into the light of day[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                             
I'll be in the yard still taking pictures in the dark [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
Of all our torn up praise[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
Eeee[/tab]

[Verse 5]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                                              
Leave me all alone, I won't be chased, I won't be thrown [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
I won't be bleeding for you bleeding for me everyday[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                                      
Tell me where you've been and I will tell you where I've been [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
It will be all okay[/tab]

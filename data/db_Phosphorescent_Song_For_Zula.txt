[tab][ch]E[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]
Some say love is a burning thing[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#m[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
That it makes a fiery ring[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]B[/ch]
Oh but I know love as a fading thing[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#m[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Just as fickle as a feather in a stream[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]B[/ch]
See honey I saw love You see it came to me[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#m[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
It put its face up to my face so I could see[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
Yeah then I saw love disfigure me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#m[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Into something I am not recognizing[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]
See the cage it called I said Come on in[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#m[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
I will not open myself up this way again[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]B[/ch]
Nor lay my face to the soil nor my teeth to the sand[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C#m[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
I will not lay like this for days now upon end[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]B[/ch]
You will not see me fall nor see me struggle to stand[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]                                     [ch]A[/ch]
To be acknowledge by some touch from his gnarled hands[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]B[/ch]
You see the cage it called I said Come on in[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#m[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
I will not open myself up this way again[/tab]

[tab]                     [ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]B[/ch]
You see the moon is bright in that treetop night[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#m[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
I see the shadows that we cast in the cold clean light[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
My feet are gold My heart is white[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#m[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
and we race out on the desert plains all night[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
See honey I am not some broken thing[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#m[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
No my heart is gold My feet are light[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C#m[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
and I am racing out on the desert plains all night[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]
So some say love is a burning thing[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#m[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
That it makes a fiery ring[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]
Oh but I know love as a caging thing[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#m[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
Just a killer come to call from some awful dream[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]
O and all you folks you come to see[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#m[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
You just stand there in the glass looking at me[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]
but my heart is wild And my bones are steam[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C#m[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
and I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free[/tab]

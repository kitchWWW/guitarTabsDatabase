[Verse: Ryan Hennessy]

[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                 [ch]Ab[/ch]
It's complicated, she's understated[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
But I smell your smell on her skin and I hate it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]             [ch]Ab[/ch]
Wish it wasn't two of us[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                   [ch]Bb[/ch]                  [ch]Cm[/ch]
In line for her heart, do you know her apartment like I do?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]                         [ch]Eb[/ch]
Oh, it's getting hard on my heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]      [ch]Bb[/ch]
Oh-oh Oh-oh[/tab]

[Chorus: Ryan Hennessy]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                             [ch]Ab[/ch]
And I wish it was my name she called[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]Eb[/ch]
When she's fast asleep and she's talking[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Bb[/ch]
But lately, it's only been yours, and[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Cm[/ch]
I'm in the middle of love[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Ab[/ch]
And she's lying there in my bed[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Eb[/ch]
But she's kissing you in her head[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Bb[/ch]
I wonder does she go there often[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Cm[/ch]   [ch]Ab[/ch]  [ch]Eb[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]
While I'm in the middle of love-ove[/tab]
(I'm in the middle of love)

[Verse: Dean Lewis]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                           [ch]Eb[/ch]
And every time it's just us alone[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                     [ch]Cm[/ch]
And I see your name on her phone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]                      [ch]Eb[/ch]                       [ch]Bb[/ch]
I wonder are you just a call or a place she calls home[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Cm[/ch]                              [ch]Ab[/ch]
She makes me feel like I'm high, I can't keep it inside[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Eb[/ch]                         [ch]Bb[/ch]
She's the one thing that makes me feel so damn alive[/tab]

[Chorus: Dean Lewis]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                             [ch]Ab[/ch]
And I wish it was my name she called[/tab]

[Bridge: Dean Lewis & Ryan Hennessy]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                                      [ch]Ab[/ch]
And I don't even wanna know your name 'cause it'll only ever bring me pain[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]
Always, always[/tab]
(I'm in the middle of love)
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                                     [ch]Ab[/ch]                                     [ch]Eb[/ch]    [ch]Bb[/ch]
And even if she never comes to choose, I will always be prepared to lose her love[/tab]
(I'm in the middle of love)

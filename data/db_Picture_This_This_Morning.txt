[Verse]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Do you love me? Or do you just hate being alone?[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
And are you hurting? Why must you be so cold?[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Why are you like this? Is it because of what happened before?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
It must be priceless, being loved in the dark.[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Can you tell me now, what I am to do?[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Can you show me how, how to make it true?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
Because this morning, I woke up next to you,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
And I was falling. But I guess it just fell through.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
Oh this morning, I turned to look at you.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
But you were gone, and I just don't know what to do.[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
And do I love you? Or do I just hate being alone?[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
And does it hurt you, hearing me be this cold?[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Why am I like this? Is it because of what happened before?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
It must be priceless, being loved in the dark. Being loved in the dark.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
Because this morning, I woke up next to you,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
And I was falling. But I guess it just fell through.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
Oh this morning, I turned to look at you.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
But you were gone, and I just don't know what to do.[/tab]
  [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
And I was falling, oh this morning.[/tab]

[Refrain]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
The late night talks, the offstage calls, the shoulder every time.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch]
The summer walks, and all we've thought have all been left behind.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
There's nothing now, but distance how did we end up this way?[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
We can try to fix this, but I think it's far too late. (I think it's far too late.)[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
Because this morning, I woke up next to you,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
And I was falling. But I guess it just fell through.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
Oh this morning, I turned to look at you.[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
But you were gone, and I just don't know what to do.[/tab]
   [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
And I was falling, oh this morning.[/tab]

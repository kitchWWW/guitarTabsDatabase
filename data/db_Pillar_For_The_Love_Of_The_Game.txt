Artist: Pillar
Song: For The Love Of The Game
Genre: 
Key: 


There has been a few attempts at the intro which didn't look too sucessful, So I really
this is no skin of Pillar's teeth since I'm trying to tab this before Pillar released
thats why its just the intro, but still challenging to play as always :). I think it 
a compressor to bring out the single notes and a noise gate as per usual for Pillar. Base
on technique and listen to the track to get it right. Its drop C and goes like this..

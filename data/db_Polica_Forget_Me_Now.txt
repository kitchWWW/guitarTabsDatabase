[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Count your blessings now[/tab]

Count your blessings
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]
Ask him once, then ask him twice[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]C[/ch]
Ask him nice, then lose your mind[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Am[/ch]
All your sorries wrapped in a bow[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]F[/ch]
Will eat those petals and thorns you know[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Make you want to drink it harder[/tab]

Make you want to run away
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Like I begged for you to take me[/tab]

Was the other way baby yeah


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
What about me makes you[/tab]

What about me makes you
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
What about me makes you lie, lie?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
What about me makes you lie?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Right into my face[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
I'm laying alone in your disgrace[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Make it up to me someday[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
No, I'm gone[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
All the good men that I know[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]C[/ch]
Lost their light to pills and blow[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
Walking a little too tall[/tab]

Plenty lacked in gall
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
What a hazard it must be[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
To talk all night about making things[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
Make you want to drink it harder[/tab]

Make you want to run away
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Like I begged for you to take me[/tab]

Was the other way baby yeah


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
What about me makes you[/tab]

What about me makes you
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
What about me makes you lie, lie?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
What about me makes you lie?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Right into my face[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
I'm laying alone in your disgrace[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Make it up to me someday[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
No, I'm[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Count your blessings now[/tab]

Count your blessings
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
I can still feel New Orleans[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]C[/ch]
Driving high with your love on me[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
Watch me slip from his mind[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]
He needs it one more time[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
Make you want to drink it harder[/tab]

Make you want to run away
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Like I begged for you to take me[/tab]

Was the other way baby yeah


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
What about me makes you[/tab]

What about me makes you
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
What about me makes you lie, lie?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]
What about me makes you lie?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Right into my face[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
I'm laying alone in your disgrace[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Make it up to me someday[/tab]

Come in and take out,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]D/F#[/ch]
All of your luggage and baggage[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
You carry around in your head[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]D/F#[/ch]
And I'll carry you, carry you.[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
Hold on if you can,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]       
The sun will be rising and[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D/F#[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
I'll lead you out of this land[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]D/F#[/ch]
With these hands, I'll carry you, carry you.[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Would you say you love me,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Even though, I hardly know you?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Would you say you love me,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]    
Even though, I hardly know you?[/tab]


Move slow and take time,
Open your heart,
Tell me now what's on your mind
And you'll find I'll carry you, carry you.

Stay strong, in your heart,
And I'll try to give you more
Than what's torn you apart from the start,
I'll carry you, carry you.

Would you say you love me,
Even though, I hardly know you?

Would you say you love me,
Even though, I hardly know you?

[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]Dm[/ch]    
In the deep blue circling waters of the oceans of the world[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
There's a legend, many stories, many myths[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
From days gone by of old mans talks and dreams cast from the shore[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]
That rolls home on the morning mist[/tab]


[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Leviathan's your brother and your sister to the stars,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
Like a part of creation, [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
Like the beating of your heart[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
Well like time has no beginning, like a friendship has no end[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
Like the soul and the spirit of lev- ia -than[/tab]


Same chords as v1:

To the sands that make the shore line, like the clouds that ride the sky
To the winds of time that shift and change
There's a question I'm not sure of and an answer I never heard,
The reason lying somewhere unexplained

Why you spend most your days fleeing from the blowing sails,
Never tiring, never leaving you alone
Why they kill you for no reason, with their spears and their harpoons,
Get drunk on your death and then turn home

Same chords as c1:

Leviathan's your brother and your sister to the stars,
Like a part of creation, 
Like the beating of your heart
Well like time has no beginning, like a friendship has no end
Like the soul and the spirit of leviathan

Verse 4:

One day we'll know how much it will take,
To stop all this killing before it's too late
And the seas will return to wash the sands clean
But your soul and your spirit be forever set free 

Chorus:

Leviathan's your brother and your sister to the stars,
Like a part of creation, 
Like the beating of your heart
Well like time has no beginning, like a friendship has no end
Like the soul and the spirit of leviathan

Artist: Post Malone
Song: A Thousand Bad Times
Genre: 
Key: 


There are small differences in the Chord progressions of the Verses because I actually found it better fitting
when I was singing along to it but you could always pick one or the other B or Bmaj7sus2 Chord.
Bmaj7 = Bmaj7sus2 like in the Chord description.

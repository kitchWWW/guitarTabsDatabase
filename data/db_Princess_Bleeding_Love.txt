Chords by: VALERA, CHARLIE EDSEL  AYUNON

Verse:
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Closed off from love I didnt need the pain [/tab]
[tab][ch]C9[/ch]
Once or twice was enough And it was all in vain [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
Time starts to pass before you know it youre frozen [/tab]

Verse:
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But something happened For the very first time with you[/tab]
[tab][ch]C9[/ch] 
My heart melts into the ground Found something true [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And everyones looking round [/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch] 
Thinking Im going crazy [/tab]


[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But I dont care what they say Im in love with you [/tab]
[tab][ch]C9[/ch]
They try to pull me away But they dont know the truth [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
My hearts crippled by the vein That I keep on closing [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You cut me open and I [/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love [/tab]
[tab][ch]C9[/ch]
I keep bleeding I keep, keep bleeding love [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You cut me open [/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Trying hard not to hear But they talk so loud [/tab]
[tab][ch]C9[/ch]
Their piercing sounds fill my ears Try to fill me with doubt [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Yet I know that the goal [/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]  
Is to keep me from falling [/tab]


[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But nothings greater Than the rush that comes with your embrace [/tab]
[tab][ch]C9[/ch]
And in this world of loneliness I see your face [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Yet everyone around me Thinks that Im going crazy, maybe, maybe [/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But I dont care what they say Im in love with you [/tab]
[tab][ch]C9[/ch]
They try to pull me away But they dont know the truth[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
My hearts crippled by the vein That I keep on closing [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You cut me open and I [/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love [/tab]
[tab][ch]C9[/ch]
I keep bleeding I keep, keep bleeding love [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You cut me open [/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And its draining all of me [/tab]
[tab][ch]C9[/ch]
Oh they find it hard to believe [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Ill be wearing these scars [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
For everyone to see [/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I dont care what they say Im in love with you [/tab]
[tab][ch]C9[/ch]
They try to pull me away But they dont know the truth [/tab]

My hearts crippled by the vein That I keep on closing [/tab]

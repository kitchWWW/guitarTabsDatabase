[Verse 1]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
These white tufts of your vapour trail[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Have sprouted and taken root[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
It's like you're at the big shiny wheel[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
Where candyfloss is born and grows as the stick turns[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
Spinning out your vapour trail[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
I head north, stopping at stations[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
With rainbow diesel stains[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Singing accents of teenagers and hills[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Not black but green, rolling out to sea[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
As you're spinning out your vapour trail[/tab]


[Chorus 1]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
These people hold me and I hold them[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
These people hold me and I hold them[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
With these arms that reach beyond the grave[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
To the lives that grew from such embrace[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
I was cast as a big player[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Throwing hollow shapes on a hollow stage[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
As you're spinning out your vapour trail[/tab]


[Chorus 2]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Your people hold me and I hold them[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
Your people hold me and I hold them[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
You underline the sky with all you've left behind[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
You underline the sky with all you've left behind[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
You underline the sky with all you've left behind[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Spinning out your vapour trail[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
These white tufts of your vapour trail[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Have sprouted and taken root[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
When thrown in at the deep end[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Friendship can be forced, fondness not so much[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And I think we're there[/tab]

[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Your road leads to hell[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
even when its paved with good intentions[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
and i can see it so well[/tab]
[tab] [ch]E[/ch]
though you try to distract my attention[/tab]
with your tactics of fear and your lies
saying that i need your protection
but you can keep your good words of advice
cus i will go the other direction

i will never follow you
i will never follow you
i will never follow your way

its a road to destruction a road of distractions
i wrote this to focus and to take action
cus i dont wanna follow your chase for the dollar
your crusade for oil your race is immoral
no love for your brothers no love for your sisters
a beauty contest for the ones whore the quickest
drugged up to endure it emotions switched off
switch on your computers live through the keyboard

[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
when they give the noble peace prize[/tab]

to a war monger

[Chorus]
i will never follow you
i will never follow you
i will never follow your way

if you move right i will turn left
and if you move backwards i will take another step
forward into the future
forward into the future

i will never follow you
i will never follow you
i will never follow your way

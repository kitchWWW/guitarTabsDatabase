A wise man said: "I can tell your size by your car"[/tab]

Tell me who's your friend and I'll tell you who you are[/tab]

Like a foolish generation who feel the vibrations of the wind[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Gsus2[/ch]  DaddG
And change to be normal?[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Gsus2[/ch]  DaddG
Do we have to be normal?[/tab]

A wise man said we are running to stand still
And we've been running for so many years we can't feel our feet
Like some misplaced kid who was popular in Junior High
We're tryin' to be normal
Do we have to be normal?

A wise man said that life is what you make it
I bet he was a rich bitch who never even seen the hood
Like a blind man who's trying to guide another blind
In the name of the liberal
Do we have to be normal?

A wise man said: "kill us while we're young"
And then he took all the drugs he found 'cause he couldn't run
Daily everybody try to quit nobody wanna die
They did it to be hip then
Now they're all in coma

[ch]Gsus[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]Gsus[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

A wise man said forgive them for their sins
'Cause they don't know what they're doing, neither do they care
And still people hate those who refuse to follow the stream
Do we have to be normal?
Do we have to be normal?

[Intro]

[ch]E[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
[ch]E[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse]

[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
Well he lost his mind behind enemy lines always running, always under fire[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Taken prisoner in a land of dreams that was a nightmare in disguise[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Never been so scared, so filled with pain his life passed before his eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
No one thought that he would be the one to surrender to all their lies[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]                  [ch]E[/ch]

Don't you know that I won't let you go[/tab]

[Verse 2]

[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
He was taken by surprise, he was paralyzed losing all his will to live[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]
He told them all everything he knew tll there was nothing more left to give[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Locked alone in an empty room his plans are finally made[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
In the glaring light of a single flame reality begins to fade[/tab]


[Chorus 2]

[tab]                  [ch]E[/ch]
That's why you're missing in action[/tab]

[Verse 3]

[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
The kiss of death lingers on his lips he's headed for an early grave[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]
Cause the end of a needle and a rusty spoon are the only life he has to crave[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I can see he's a casualty of a freedom that's never free[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
He's a missing person in a sea of dreams dreams not meant to be[/tab]


[Chorus 3]

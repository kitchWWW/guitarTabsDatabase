[Verse]

[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
She was a blonde haired beauty I think you know the score[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
The kind that walks with trouble she put me on the floor[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
I could not take my eyes off her[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Your honor help me please[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
I tried to give her a lesson[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
She gave me a little squeeze[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
No one said it would be easy[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Makin love like it never ends[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I thought I was done and she was the one[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I didn't understand[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
There's the right way[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
If you just want to get it done[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
Well, there's the right way[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
But the wrong way is a lot more fun[/tab]

[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I put myself right to it I mean how hard can it be?[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
She was blue eyed crazy and I was on my knees[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
I let her tell me a story[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
I couldn't hear he lines[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
But I knew how it ended[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Just in the nick of time[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
No one said it would be easy[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Makin love like it never ends[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I thought I was done and she was the one[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I didn't understand[/tab]


[Chorus 2]

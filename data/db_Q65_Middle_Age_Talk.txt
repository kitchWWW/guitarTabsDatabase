Genre: 
Key: G


The chords to the album-version of "Middle-Age Talk" (from Revolution) by Q65. This is my first tab so let
me know if you have comments. I tried to capture the lyrics exactly as they were sung (not always with result)




The intro is just a solo over the G minor pentatonic scale starting at the D-note on the high E-string
(10th fred) and walking down to the G-note on the low E-sting (3th fred)

 ~G~
I'll tell you what to do. If you want to get rid of me, you just have to knock me on the head,
the government breaks in a thousand pieces, for I'm gonna give you 'till the end, 'till the end of our story.
The story that's already have been told a million years ago, of a man and a woman who let their love slip away
a long time ago

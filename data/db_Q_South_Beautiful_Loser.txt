[tab][ch]B7[/ch],
Once when you were mine we walked alone in soul tranquility[/tab]
[tab][ch]B7[/ch]
Once it had to end the perfect stop to make me start again[/tab]

Chorus: Love, love, if only I were someone else[/tab]

It all comes down to me the answers and the questions perfectly.[/tab]

what is left to be. Everything was everything to me. Can't you see?[/tab]

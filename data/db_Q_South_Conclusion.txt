CONCLUSION from Q-South/Q-South 1997


[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]                                    
And in the end the pieces all come together[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]                               
I can't tell you when until then we must endeavor[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                                                          
all of the  rotten gazes and the lifeless places[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]                                          
I  hide the truth from myself    [/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Aadd4/C#[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]                             
so that the days don't seem as long and I move on [/tab]

[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]                                   
And in the end a price is placed on the treasure[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]                                          
you will never live up to what you were measured[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                                                           
all of the people before you[/tab]

and those who ignored you
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]                                                 
I hide the truth from myself                                                                      [/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Aadd4/C#[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]                             
so that the days don't seem as long and I move on [/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]F#m[/ch]                                   
Heaven knows I've tried to come to a conclusion [/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]F#m[/ch]                                   
Heaven knows I've tried to come to a conclusion [/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]     [ch]F#m[/ch]                                                 
this reach for the roof [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]                                    
And in the end the answer is less complicated[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]                                       
and in the end life is then what you've made it[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]                                     
and in the end now stop me if I am wrong[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]                                 
but the days don't seem as long [/tab]

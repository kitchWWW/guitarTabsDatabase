[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
After all that I've done[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Yet, you still had to run[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
I know it's not who you are[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]
You're so much better[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
I gave you all I've got[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Tried to be what I'm not[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
High in the lost and found[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]
Thought I could do better[/tab]


[Pre-chorus]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
Maybe I don't know what I'm wanting[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Baby I'm so lost, I'll be honest[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                               [ch]D#[/ch]
I wish I could tell you how bad I want it[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
And you've been trying to runaway[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Stay around, I'm done waiting[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
Let's not get out baby, it's raining[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]
We could be doing a lot of things[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
And you've been trying to runaway[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Stay around, I'm done waiting[/tab]

That's the fight that I've lost[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
It's like I've been chasing ghosts[/tab]

You said what we had is gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]
And that's for the better[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
I gave you all I've got[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]

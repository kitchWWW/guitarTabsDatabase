[Verse 1]
[tab]  [ch]Ab[/ch]                                      [ch]Bb[/ch]

[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                                        [ch]Gm[/ch]
Cut all the chatter, no, y'all are not rappers, you just some ad-libbers like, "Ayy," huh (For real)[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]                          [ch]Bb[/ch]
I just pulled up, back in black, drop a hit, they react to that (Ooh, huh)[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                                      [ch]Gm[/ch]
Now they see this and they acting mad (Yeah), like I’m Kanye in a MAGA hat, yeah[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Ab[/ch]                       [ch]Bb[/ch]
I’m so alone, see, I’ve always been one and only[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Eb[/ch]                                [ch]Gm[/ch]
Even back when this gold chain was made out of macaroni[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
Now they always askin' me, what happened to the old me?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch]                                [ch]Gm[/ch]
I wish I could’ve told him goodbye, wish he had known me (Yeah)[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Ab[/ch]                                     [ch]Bb[/ch]
Wish that I could tell you 'bout how everyone would know you (Uh-huh)[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Eb[/ch]                                 [ch]Gm[/ch]
And tell you it’s worth it, despite everything they told you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Ab[/ch]                               [ch]Bb[/ch]
Cryin' silent in your pillow sayin', “I wish I was homeschooled” (Yeah)[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Eb[/ch]                                   [ch]Gm[/ch]
Too afraid to sing your songs because you thought that they would roast you, yeah[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Ab[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
I was nine, friends told me I would go lose (They did)[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Eb[/ch]               [ch]Gm[/ch]
Now it’s time I think I gotta show you (Think I gotta show you)[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Ab[/ch]            [ch]Bb[/ch]                      [ch]Eb[/ch]
That’s my mind, say I don’t care, but I so do[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Gm[/ch]                     [ch]Ab[/ch]
Having trouble walkin' up a mile in my own shoes[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bb[/ch]                               [ch]Eb[/ch]
Never used to bet on me and now they like, “I owe you”[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Gm[/ch]                             [ch]Ab[/ch]
Lookin' back at them like, “The fuck? I do not know you”[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bb[/ch]                      [ch]Eb[/ch]
When I make a milli', mo’fucker, I'ma show you[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Gm[/ch]                               [ch]Ab[/ch]
What I had to go through to feel like I’m supposed to[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]
Ego, I don’t need no[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Eb[/ch]             [ch]Gm[/ch]
Other people in my trio[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Ab[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
Myself, I and me, though, we know[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Eb[/ch]             [ch]Gm[/ch]             [ch]Ab[/ch]
We don't need no kilos, my watch frio[/tab]

Yeah


[Chorus 2]
[tab]          [ch]Bb[/ch]
I’m on my ego death[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Ab[/ch]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]
But I let it breathe again, yeah, I let it resurrect[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Ab[/ch]
Yeah, uh (Yeah)[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
I just wanna be the best[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Ab[/ch]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]
But I had to reassess, is that why I’m feelin' less? Yeah (Yeah)[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab] [ch]Ab[/ch]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]
On the way, all okay, only a call away, feeling like a god on my Charlemagne (Huh?)[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]Eb[/ch]
I really think they want my presence,[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Gm[/ch]
like a holiday (Yeah), but I think I need to learn when to walk away (I do)[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Ab[/ch]                                        [ch]Bb[/ch]
Man, I got so many problems, but I wanna stay without acknowledgin' how often I have gone astray (Yeah)[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Eb[/ch]
First step is denial, but I’m over that[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                                              [ch]Ab[/ch]                [ch]Bb[/ch]
And I’ve accepted it already, but it holds me back, yeah, back, yeah[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]Eb[/ch]                       [ch]Gm[/ch]
Slurring my words I been moving too fast, yeah (Okay), fast, yeah[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Ab[/ch]                [ch]Bb[/ch]
Maybe I don’t wanna share it like that, yeah (Uh), that’s facts, yeah[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Eb[/ch]                    [ch]Gm[/ch]
I need to stop checking all of the stats, like that, like that, yeah, ayy (Yeah)[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]          [ch]Bb[/ch]
I’m on my ego death[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Ab[/ch]               [ch]Bb[/ch]
I had to reassess, I had to resurrect, yeah[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Ab[/ch]                   [ch]Bb[/ch]
Huh, hey, huh, I just wanna be the best[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Ab[/ch]                         [ch]Bb[/ch]
But I had to reassess, is that why I’m feelin' less? Yeah[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]                     [ch]Bb[/ch]
I got fourty-thousand comments this week[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Ab[/ch]                               [ch]Bb[/ch]
At least five-thousand said that I should kill myself, I’m a freak[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Ab[/ch]                                        [ch]Bb[/ch]
I’m too weak, I'm a leech, and all my music fuckin' sucks, I’m a geek[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Ab[/ch]                                          [ch]Bb[/ch]
I’m everythin' they want me to be and that’s the problem with me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Ab[/ch]                           [ch]Bb[/ch]
So when they say you got a ego, tell 'em, "Thank the fuckin' Lord"[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]                                  [ch]Gm[/ch]
'Cause if you didn’t, you’d be suffering, you’d be stuck there on the floor with nothin' more[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]                     [ch]Bb[/ch]
At least I’m out here smilin' in the quicksand[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Eb[/ch]                                [ch]Gm[/ch]
Take your head out of that pillow, one day, you gon' be the big man[/tab]

Yeah


[Part III]


[Outro]
[tab] [ch]Gm[/ch]
In the dark[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Gm[/ch]           [ch]Fm[/ch]
I stare into mirrors for hours[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
Until I can’t recognize myself[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Fm[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
A dissonant reflection[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Fm[/ch]                      [ch]Eb[/ch]
Both a sober and a sobering hallucination[/tab]

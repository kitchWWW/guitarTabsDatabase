[Verse]
[tab]              [ch]G#m7[/ch]                [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
And it's the feelin' of driftin' apart[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G#m7[/ch]               [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
When you've been intertwined from the start[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G#m7[/ch]                         [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
Pulled a muscle, stretched a thousand miles[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D#m[/ch] [ch]C#m[/ch]
Our hearts rewired, yeah[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G#m7[/ch]                   [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
And the blood can only flow so far (Mm)[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G#m7[/ch]                  [ch]C#m7/G#[/ch]
Before you don't feel anything at all[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G#m7[/ch]                        [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
And it hurts 'cause it was nobody's fault[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D#m[/ch] [ch]C#m[/ch]
Our hearts desires (Yeah)[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G#m7[/ch]                 [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
And it was all said and done anyways (Ah)[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G#m7[/ch]                      [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
To say goodbye a million different ways (Ah)[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G#m7[/ch]                  [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
Until we couldn't say goodbye anymore[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D#m[/ch] [ch]C#m[/ch]
Our hearts retired (Ah)[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m7[/ch]                  [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
I fell apart in your arms[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G#m7[/ch]                          [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
But I still felt like a part of your arms[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G#m7[/ch]                          [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
And I still feel like a part to hold on[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D#m[/ch]   [ch]C#m[/ch]
Off of the cliff's edge[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G#m7[/ch]                   [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
But the mountain was made out of glass[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G#m7[/ch]                               [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
When we saw through whatever caused us to crack[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G#m7[/ch]                        [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
When the world has trouble trying to cast[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D#m[/ch] [ch]C#m[/ch]
its lonely shadow[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G#m7[/ch]                        [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
Mistook your love of me for my own (Ah)[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G#m7[/ch]                      [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
Tricked me into false self acceptance[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m7[/ch]                    [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
I'm still a fly in the shape of a man[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D#m[/ch] [ch]C#m[/ch]
In the crevice[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G#m7[/ch]                   [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
So we walked to the top once again[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G#m7[/ch]                  [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
Won't look down until the end[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m7[/ch]         [ch]C#m/G#[/ch]
     Up the hill[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D#m[/ch] [ch]C#m[/ch]
Our hearts united[/tab]

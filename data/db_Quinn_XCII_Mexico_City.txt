[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]Em[/ch]
 One day, he was standin' on the 105[/tab]
[tab]                                          [ch]D[/ch]
Stickin' out his thumb because he needs a ride[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Bm[/ch]
A girl pulled over and picked him up[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                            [ch]Em[/ch]
 She asked him if the President should get impeached[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
But I think we're gonna be good friends"[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
Save up our paychecks, buy a new Benz[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Try all the boujee little food trends[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
And no one will yell whenever we spend our money[/tab]

He said, "Let's go, let's go, let's go, and we'll never leave[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Down here in Mexico City[/tab]

Livin' out of your trunk"[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                               [ch]Em[/ch]

Use up their minutes on their new phones[/tab]

Never have chores 'cause they don't do those[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Bm[/ch]
Hit up the bank, ask for a new loan[/tab]

For more money[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
 Satellites in the sky, yeah, they think it's a sign[/tab]

They should probably get back home
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
  Out of sight, out of mind, that's like most of the time[/tab]

They don't wanna go home
[tab][ch]D[/ch]

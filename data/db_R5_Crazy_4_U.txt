I played it safe 
I kept my foot up on the brake 
I never really took a chance in life 
And didn't live for today 

Aw girl and then I met you 
Opened my eyes to something new 
You know you set me free like no one else
And got me acting a fool 

Don't you know you changed, my life, girl
Cuz now I'm living and it feels so right Yeah

You got my heart beat pumpin' and it's goin' insane
You got me jumpin' out of aeroplanes
And that's why
I'm crazy it's true, Crazy 4 you

You got me base jump livin' and I can't look down
You know you short circuit my brain
I can't lie
I'm crazy it's true, Crazy 4 you

Midnight dippin' in the pool
Sneaking out up on the roof
You're unpredictable and girl that's what
That's what I love about you

Don't you know you changed, my life, girl
Cause Now I'm living and it feels so right Yeah

You got my heart beat pumpin' and it's goin' insane
You got me jumpin' out of aeroplanes
And that's why
I'm crazy it's true, Crazy 4 you

You got me base jump livin' and I can't look down
You know you short circuit my brain
I can't lie
I'm crazy it's true, Crazy 4 you

Em                            C7 (8th fret bar version)
I didn't lose my mind when I fell for you (without a parachute)
And I'm gonna love you girl like you never knew woah

Don't you know you changed, my life, girl
Cause now I'm livin' and it feels so right Yeah

You got my heart beat pumpin' and it's goin' insane
You got me jumpin' out of aeroplanes
And that's why
I'm crazy it's true, Crazy 4 you

You got me base jump livin' and I can't look down
You know you short circuit my brain
I can't lie
I'm crazy it's true, Crazy 4 you

I'm crazy it's true, Crazy 4 you

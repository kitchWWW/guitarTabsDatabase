This is 9-9 by REM. I'm not certain about the intro so here's my best
shot:

[tab]E:-2-3-5-3s2-2 that's the bassline....[/tab]

[tab]e:---0-----0-----0-----0-----
B:-2---2-3---3-5---5-3---3-3-2    that's my best guess at the jangles[/tab]

Verse:
A two punch.............right on target........
[ch]E[/ch]         [ch]Esus4[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]Bm[/ch]   7th fret harmonics-s-5th fret harmonics

Chorus:
Give me a couple of, don't give me a couple of pointers turn to lies and 
[ch]B[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]B[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]   

Conversation fear.
      [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]      7th fret harmonics-s-5th fret harmonics

Lyrics:

Steady repetition is a compulsion mutually reenforced.
Now what does that mean?
Is there a just contradiction?
Nothing much.
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord, hesitate.

Got to punch
Right on target
Twisting tongues
Gotta stripe down his back
all nine yards down her back

Give me a couple,
Don't give me a couple of pointers,
Turn to lies and conversation fear

Got to punch
Right on target
Twisting tongues
Gotta stripe down his back
all nine yards down her back

Give me a couple,
Don't give me a couple of pointers,
Turn to lies and conversation fear

What is my mind?
What is my mind?

Steady repetition is a compulsion mutually reenforced.
Now what does that mean?
Is there a just contradiction?
Nothing much.
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake, oh come on, hesitate, hesitate.

Got to punch
Right on target
Twisting tongues
Gotta stripe down his back
all nine yards down her back

Give me a couple,
Don't give me a couple of pointers,
Turn to lies and conversation fear

Conversation fear. Conversation fear. Conversation fear.

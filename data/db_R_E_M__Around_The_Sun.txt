Around The Sun

[tab][ch]E[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]F#m[/ch]
I want the sun to shine on me [/tab]
I want the truth to set me free 
I wish the followers would lead 
with a voice so strong it could knock me to my knees 

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]        
hold on world 'cause you don't know what's coming [/tab]
hold on world 'cause I'm not jumping off 
hold onto this boy a little longer 
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
take another trip around the sun [/tab]

if I jumped into the ocean to believe 
If I climbed a mountain would I have to reach? 
do I even dare to speak?--to dream?--believe? 
give me a voice so strong 
I can question what I have seen 

hold on world 'cause you don't know what's coming 
hold on world 'cause I'm not jumping off 
hold onto this boy a little longer 
take another trip around the sun

(During the intro and breakdown, Peter sticks to this. During the verse,
however,
he adlibs a bit and instead of hitting the second "7" of the riff, he will
substitute
by hitting the high E string or some other random note.)

LYRICS
She didn't want to get pinned down by her prior town
Get me to the train on time, here take this nickel make a dime
Take this penny and make it into a necklace when I leave
What is at the other end, I don't know another friend
Another wife, another morning spent
Listen, listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine

We never wrote the reasons that I need explained
Some things are givens, and others get away
This time its for myself you call it what you may
Okay, we won't say goodbye so long, so much more
Listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine

Listen to the bargain holler
Listen to the barter holler
Listen to the auctioneer

Get me to the train on time here take this nickel make a dime
Take this penny and make it into a necklace when I leave
What is at the other end, an I don't know another friend
Another wife, another morning spent
Listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine

Do I stand the bargain holler?
Listen to the barter holler
Listen to the auctioneer

Gonna saddle my horse in the darkness,ride out in the morning dew[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
Breathe some air that's never been breathed.[/tab]

We'll cheer that bucking horse and the wild ride.[/tab]

I'm gonna shoot a hole in my TV set and let the silence ring on through;[/tab]

If you're sayin' that you missed it all, I'm bettin' that you're wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Don't tell me it's dead and gone.[/tab]

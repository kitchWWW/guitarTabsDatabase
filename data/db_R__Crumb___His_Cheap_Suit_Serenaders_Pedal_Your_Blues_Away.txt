just pedaling your blues away.[/tab]

Things are hunky-dory as you fly.[/tab]

In the middle of your heart, you'll find a new song,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]D7[/ch]
With your palsey-walsey riding by your side.[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Pedal your blues away,[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
you'll find love in every byway.[/tab]

Hold up your chin, let them see your grin,

And pedal your blues away![/tab]

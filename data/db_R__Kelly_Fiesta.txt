[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Chilling in my four point six at the light, about to be VIP for the night.[/tab]
Shorty in the drop-top V made a right,
pull up to her bumper baby, beeped twice.
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Jumped out the whip like I was the police,[/tab]
didn't have a gun, but my wrist said please.
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Knock five way on a DVD, she's a baller and I'm a baller, (for what)[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
To all my hot girls living fiesta. To all my hot boys, living fiesta.[/tab]
[tab]                                                                   [ch]Dm[/ch]
To all my Chi town niggas, fiesta, and all my uptown niggas, fiesta.[/tab]
To all my players and my hustlers, fiesta,
[tab]                                         [ch]Am[/ch]
And if you sitting on them planes, fiesta,[/tab]
to all my honeys in the club, fiesta,
and if you rolling with a thug, fiesta.

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
We be off in the club sipping lot, red eye deep in the club puffing lot.[/tab]
Strippers in the back of the club showing live,
soon as I get a buzz I'm showing out.
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
House on top of the hill, counting what?[/tab]
Whose gonna buy the bar, got enough.
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Take the haters out in the back, rough 'em up.[/tab]
I'm a baller, now where's my ballers? (with what)

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
To all my hot girls living fiesta. To all my hot boys, living fiesta.[/tab]
[tab]                                                                   [ch]Dm[/ch]
To all my Chi town niggas, fiesta, and all my uptown niggas, fiesta.[/tab]
To all my players and my hustlers, fiesta,
[tab]                                          [ch]Am[/ch]
And if you sitting on them planes, fiesta,[/tab]
to all my honeys in the club, fiesta,
and if you rolling with a thug, fiesta.

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
We pop Cris on a daily base, plus we got honeys all up in the place.[/tab]
About to wild out in a major way, so put your hands up if you made your pay.
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Add a little juice to the Tangaray,[/tab]
but let the ice chill till the diamond fades.
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Rock land sitting on Capitol Hill, trackmaster make capital deals.[/tab]

[Interlude]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Now look at Gotti iced out with the blinky-bling[/tab]
And a big body sitting on them gleamy things.
Now Rockland niggas know the means of cream,
Kelly, R.B, Thug and it sings to king.
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
Got PJ niggas in Caprine Green, (thugged out).[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Am[/ch]
Hot chicks down to do anything, cop them mo' chicks[/tab]
cop mo' bricks, pop mo' Cris, R. Kelly drop mo' hits.
What you know about them cats that be spending the dough?
Every day drink Henney and a bottle of Mo'.
Ride whips, hit chicks, blowing twenties a draw.
To the club thirty deep, plenty ice to show,
[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]
Mami say she never rolled in a six before. (Fiesta)[/tab]

Never seen a young cat this rich before,
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]
yeah Kelly made the way for these niggas to blow, (Fiesta)[/tab]
thugged out, 2G, Rockland for sure. (Fiesta, come on)

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
To all my hot girls living fiesta. To all my hot boys, living fiesta.[/tab]
[tab]                                                                   [ch]Dm[/ch]
To all my Chi town niggas, fiesta, and all my uptown niggas, fiesta.[/tab]
To all my players and my hustlers, fiesta,
[tab]                                         [ch]Am[/ch]
And if you sitting on them planes, fiesta,[/tab]
to all my honeys in the club, fiesta,
and if you rolling with a thug, fiesta.

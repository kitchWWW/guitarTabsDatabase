I can see the colors of the rainbow[/tab]
And I can feel the sun on my face
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
And I can feel heaven in it's place
[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]

I can feel the spirit of the nations[/tab]
And I can feel my wings ridin' the winds, yeah
I see the finish line just up ahead now
And I can feel it risin' deep within
[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]

Now I can see the distance of the journey[/tab]
High and front with all your might
You open your eyes to global warming
Been through it all, you sacrificed your life
[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
And that's the sign of a victory [x2][/tab]
Yeahh    yaeee   yeah    yeahhh  YEAEEEE

[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
If we believe, we can achieve anything[/tab]
Including the impossible, this I know
So let's lift up our heads, yeah
And raise the flag, yeah yeah
And scream like you want to win
Now let the games begin!
[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
That's the sign of a victory [x4][/tab]
Yeahh    yaeee   yeah    yeahhh  YEAEEEE
[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
When you keep on fightin'[/tab]
After you lost your strength
That's the sign of a victory
[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
When darkness is all around you[/tab]
You still find your way
That's the sign of a victory
[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Come on and sing[/tab]
Lift up your voice and sing
Stand up, oh yeah, stand up
The sign of a victory
Ooooohh ohh ohhhh
That's the sign of a victory

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
I'm standing here looking in the mirror[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Gm[/ch]
Saying "damn" to myself[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
I should have known the day would come[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]
That she would find somebody else[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
And all the things I took her through[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                                      [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone[/tab]

[Hook]
[tab]           [ch]Gm[/ch]
Cuz when a woman's fed up[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A#[/ch]
No matter how you beg, no[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
It ain't nothing you can do about it (Nothing you can do about it)[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]         [ch]Gm[/ch]
It's like running out of love[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A#[/ch]
No matter what you say, no[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm[/ch]
And then it's too late to talk about it (Too late to talk about it)[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]                                     [ch]F[/ch]
Now let's talk about how it all goes down[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
I used to make love to you daily[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
When the night fell the same[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
And anytime that you were hurt[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A#[/ch]
I could feel your pain[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
And if I had a dollar[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A#[/ch]
It was yours, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
And whenever we would go out[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A#[/ch]
I would front the bill[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
But now the up is down[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]
And the silence is sound[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
I hurt you too too many times[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]
Now I can't come around[/tab]

[Hook]
[tab]           [ch]Gm[/ch]
Cuz when a woman's fed up[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A#[/ch]
No matter how you beg, no[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
It ain't nothing you can do about it (Nothing you can do about it)[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]         [ch]Gm[/ch]
It's like running out of love[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A#[/ch]
No matter what you say, no[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm[/ch]
And then it's too late to talk about it (Too late to talk about it)[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]      [ch]Gm[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch]
La da da da da la la da da[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Gm[/ch]                [ch]Dm[/ch]
La da da da da la la da da[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                                               [ch]A#[/ch]
If you don't want to find out the hard way (the hard way oh I)[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Then listen to this song while the record plays[/tab]

[Hook]
[tab]           [ch]Gm[/ch]
Cuz when a woman's fed up[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A#[/ch]
No matter how you beg, no[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
It ain't nothing you can do about it (Nothing you can do about it)[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]         [ch]Gm[/ch]
It's like running out of love[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A#[/ch]
No matter what you say, no[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm[/ch]
And then it's too late to talk about it (Too late to talk about it)[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
You can cry a river[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]A#[/ch]
'Till an ocean starts to form, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
But she will always remember[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]
Cuz she's a woman scorned[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
And if you ever get her back[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]A#[/ch]
It will never be the same[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]F[/ch]
Every time she see your face[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
Now your trust is out the door[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]A#[/ch]
She don't want you no more[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
You used to tell your boys, not me[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]F[/ch]
And she would always be there for you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
If you had took the time to see[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]A#[/ch]
What that woman meant to you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
She was raised in Illinois[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A#[/ch]
Right outside of Chicago[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Some of the best cookin' you ever had[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]Gm[/ch]
Yes, it was and I miss her[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A#[/ch]
Hey woman, if you're listening[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
I said I miss you baby[/tab]

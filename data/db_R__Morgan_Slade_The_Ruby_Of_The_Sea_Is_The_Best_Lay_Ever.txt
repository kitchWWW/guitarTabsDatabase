[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Oh I've weathered deadly storms[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Sailing on the Ozmit Seas[/tab]

I've battled mighty waves
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
And I've felt the ocean breeze[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
The fondest of me mem'ries[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Will always be of thee[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Oh the Ruby of the Sea is the best lay ever[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Oh her hooves are tough as nails[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
And her horns are smooth as ice[/tab]

Her tongue is like a feather
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
And her tail grips you tight[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Lucky be the one who can afford her pricey fee[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Cause the Ruby of the Sea is the best lay ever[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
The Ruby of the Sea is the best lay ever[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Oh I paid her and I loved her[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Till I near forget my name[/tab]

She took my gold and closed her robe
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
And promised me she came[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
She took more than me manhood[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
I'll never be the same[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Cause the Ruby of the Sea is the best lay ever[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
The Ruby of the Sea is the best lay ever[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Cause the Ruby of the Sea is the best lay ever[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
HEY[/tab]

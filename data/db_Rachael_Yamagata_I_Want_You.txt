You sat down next to me, like poetry to wine[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]([ch]D7[/ch] optional)  [ch]Gm[/ch]
Out window looked upon a yellow neon sign[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]Gdim[/ch]\[ch]Db[/ch]   
I took your hand while you decided what to do[/tab]

(Same Chords)
You simplified me down to slogans on the wall
I took offense, but you were right about them all
My friends are telling me I shouldn't waste my time
But I can't concentrate until I make you mine
I'm drawing cards and making wishes down by the well
Who would've known I'd lose myself in that old hotel

I want you
Or no one
No one else for me
You, or no one
'Cause no one else is strong enough, strong enough
To slow me down in time to set me free

(Chorus again- Same Chords)
I want you
Or no one else
No one else is fine
Oh, you, or no one
No one is the only one
To fill me up until I make you mine

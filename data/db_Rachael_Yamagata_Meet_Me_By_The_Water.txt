'Cause I can't get you off of my mind[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
I've been thinking everyday about you[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Don't fit anywhere into my life, but that's okay[/tab]

And because of that, I'm not scared at all[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And everyone says I'm crazy[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
And everyone says I'm a fool[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Would you meet me by the water tonight[/tab]

Please don't leave me standing[/tab]
With my heart in my hand
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
I can't last here[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I'm breaking down,[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
And no one understands why I got here[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
But I knew from the very first moment[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
That I met you[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
You'd be the one      You'd be the one[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Would you meet me by the water tonight[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Would you please fall asleep[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
Holding my hand[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                          [ch]Em[/ch]
'Cause I've got everything in store for you, baby[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
     If you'll be my man[/tab]

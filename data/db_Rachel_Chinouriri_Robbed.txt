[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]                        [ch]Fm[/ch]  [ch]Ab[/ch]
Absence brought us closer than you realised[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]           [ch]Eb[/ch]                           [ch]Fm[/ch]  [ch]Ab[/ch]
Yesterday we strayed from parallel lives[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
Blank silhouettes of you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
In memories that don't exist[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                   [ch]Gm[/ch]
Words of a story shouldn't hurt like this[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
We were perfect strangers, one life torn in two[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                    [ch]Ab[/ch]
You were robbed of summer, I was robbed of you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]               [ch]Eb[/ch]
Nothing lasts forever but you were gone too soon[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                    [ch]Ab[/ch]
You were robbed of summer[/tab]
I was robbed of you

Unfamiliar face I should've recognised[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]           [ch]Eb[/ch]                                     [ch]Fm[/ch]  [ch]Ab[/ch]
Cards that we got dealt were two of different kinds[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
Blank silhouettes of you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
In memories that don't exist[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                   [ch]Gm[/ch]
Words of a story shouldn't hurt like this[/tab]

[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
We were perfect strangers, one life torn in two[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                    [ch]Ab[/ch]
You were robbed of summer, I was robbed of you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]               [ch]Eb[/ch]
Nothing lasts forever but you were gone too soon[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                    [ch]Ab[/ch]
You were robbed of summer[/tab]
I was robbed of you

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch] [ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]Ab[/ch]
And I was robbed of you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch] [ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]Ab[/ch]
And I was robbed of you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch] [ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]Ab[/ch]
I was robbed of you[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
We were perfect strangers, one life torn in two[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                    [ch]Ab[/ch]
Sad to say goodbye before I said "Hello" to you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]               [ch]Eb[/ch]
Nothing lasts forever but you were gone too soon[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                    [ch]Ab[/ch]
You were robbed of summer[/tab]
I was robbed of you

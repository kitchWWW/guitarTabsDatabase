[Intro]
[ch]Cmaj7[/ch]   [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
I check my phone for like the thirtieth time today [/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
Come up with scenarios in my head about the thing I wish you would say[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
I count my breath, I count my steps, I watch the way you breathe[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
I overthink, I over drink and worry about the things I should've said differently[/tab]

And then I'm back to


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]   [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
Wanting to check on you when I know that it's something you wouldn't think to do for me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
Cause I know that you'll be fine and you'll find another one so easily[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
But I don't wanna think of the things you did before, [/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
Or the things you'd prefer to looking through me[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]              
Cause if I'm being honest there's nothing I would rather be doing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]   [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
I'd rather be doing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
There's nothing I would rather be doing[/tab]

[ch]Cmaj7[/ch] [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                           [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
I fill my cup, they can't keep up, with my flavor of the day         [/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch] 
There here been so many theyâ€™ve been reduced to just their state [/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
Cause I'm swiping and typing then I forget what I'm writing[/tab]
And I'm stuck upstream 
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
While the boy that I'm wanting is huffing and puffing with girls much cooler then me[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]   [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
Wanting to check on you when I know that it's something you wouldn't think to do for me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
Cause I know that you'll be fine and you'll find another one so easily[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
But I don't wanna think of the things you did before, [/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
Or the things you'd prefer to looking through me[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]              
Cause if I'm being honest there's nothing I would rather be doing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]   [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
I'd rather be doing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                         [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
There's nothing I would rather be doing[/tab]

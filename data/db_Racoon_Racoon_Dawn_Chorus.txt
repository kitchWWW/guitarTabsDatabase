Key: 


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                  [ch]Gm[/ch]
Oh, I leave what's wrong,[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Fm[/ch]
Cause I've seen dawn ending the night,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bb[/ch]
No point to resist nor have a fight.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Eb[/ch]       [ch]Gm[/ch]
From days to years, just passing by,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Fm[/ch]
We lost attention, lost the light,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bb[/ch]
Across the ocean of our lies.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]                  [ch]Gm[/ch]
You know what's wrong to be with you? I never felt you wanted to,[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Fm[/ch]
Like all those parties without fun[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bb[/ch]
Like a summer without sun[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]Gm[/ch]
Oh sweetheart, let's contemplate,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Fm[/ch]
Forget your anger, drop the hate,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
We're still the masters of our fate.[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]Eb[/ch]     [ch]Gm[/ch]
Today feels wrong, tomorrow we'll be on our own[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Fm[/ch]
Everlasting game, no one ever won[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
Now it's just you and me apart[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Fm[/ch]
Each other with a broken heart[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]Eb[/ch]                   [ch]Gm[/ch]
You know what's wrong to be with you? I never felt you wanted to,[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Fm[/ch]
Like all those parties without fun[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bb[/ch]
Like a summer without sun[/tab]

[-Verse 3]
[tab]      [ch]Eb[/ch]           [ch]Gm[/ch]
After time, all things get worse,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Fm[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
I can't do one thing on my own& I have nothing on my mind[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Eb[/ch]
But to be with you[/tab]

Artist: Radical Face
Song: Echoes
Genre: 
Key: 


So, obviously this isn't exactly the way he plays it, but I thought it sounded 
pretty close. I prefer it tuned half-step down but standard works just as well. 

Also, when you see a D-, that just means to hammer on the e string behind the 
third fret about half way through the chord. I wasn't sure how else to signify it. 
Just listen to the song and you'll hear the transition.

Father was drunk on the porch[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]                     [ch]D/F#[/ch] 
Quiet, and cleaning his guns[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]Cadd9[/ch]  
While we sat, and watched the sun set[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Em7[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]-
From the roof, drinking stolen beer the day I turned twelve[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Mama is losing her mind[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]                       [ch]D/F#[/ch]
So we built a home in the woods[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
And I carved our names in the side[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]Em7[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]-             
With a knife we found beneath the house the day you turned twelve[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Cadd9[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]Em7[/ch]
And I am always reminded of lies [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D/F#[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch] 
That we told, but never meant[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Cadd9[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
And tonight, well I still hear your grin[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em7[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Like an echo, sounding from my sins[/tab]

Come on, let me in

[ch]G[/ch] [ch]Cadd9[/ch] [ch]Em7[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]-
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]Cadd9[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]Em7[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]- [ch]D[/ch]

(Same as first verse)
I remember the cast on your arm
From when we were convinced we could fly
And I would cover it up with fake names
To make it seem, like you were famous when you came back to school
And sure we never had much
But we did just as we pleased
We had no concern for anything
Beyond the day we were living in, we had no need to dream


Then, chorus again.

And that's all!

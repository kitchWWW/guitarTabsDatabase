[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
Dancing in circles we can smell the fresh air[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
Music's all we got but damn it's all we need[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]F#m[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Out here on our own life is so pure, oh yeah[/tab]

Life is so pure[/tab]

Life is so pure

[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
don't think you ever have to be lonely[/tab]

[tab]                                         [ch]F#m[/ch]

we're spinning in circles slowly away from everything that's phony[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]                                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
were clearing our minds now , and feeling fines what we're ready to do[/tab]

[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
I think that we should move to the mountains[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]F#m[/ch]
Just you and me and we'll never come back[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Done looking for the truth cuz we found it[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]E[/ch]
I hope you know we found it, I hope you know we found it, yeah[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]             [ch]F#m[/ch]
get a little muddy, laugh about the money[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
and wonder why we ever even cared about it[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
the city is funny but nature is lovely[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]
another night with you I cant be without it[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]F#m[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
And all I ever dreamed of is disappearing[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
Saddle up with my people and tell my old life that I'm leaving[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F#m[/ch]
I'm leaving right now[/tab]

[tab]                          [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]F#m[/ch]
Just you and me and we'll never come back[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]

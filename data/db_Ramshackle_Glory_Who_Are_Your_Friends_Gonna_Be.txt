Verse:
I walk down the street, I walk down the street, I walk down the street and smile at passersby
I give beggars change,I give beggars change, I give beggars change and keep walking on by.
I try to be nice, I try to be nice, I try to be nice as much as i can.

Chorus:
But the people who know; the ones who know me, they'll tell you about the man that I really am.
They'll tell you about the kind of man that I am.
They'll tell you about the man that I really am.

Verse:
And I have a mask, I have a mask, but my mask it's not going to save me today.
From a beard full of mace, from a beard full of mace, from a beard full of mace and pepper spray
And our shields just broke,yeah our shields just broke, yeah our shields are 
broken lying down on the street

Chorus
When the cops move in, when the cops move in, when the cops move in who are your 
friends going to be?
Who the fuck do you think that your friends are going to be?

Verse:
And Lord only knows, and lord only knows, yeah lord only knows how short this life will be
And What I don't know , yeah What I don't know, What I don't know  is if that's 
going  to be short enough for me
'cause i fell asleep cold, I fell asleep cold, fell asleep so cold that I could barely breath

Chorus
I lay down alone, I lay down alone, Lay down so alone that I could barley see
When the cops move in who are my friends going to be?
Fell so alone that I could barley see.

[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Well, I need a sip of muddy water[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
From my daddy's wishin' well[/tab]

Scattered his ashes on the delta
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
From here on I'll be drinkin' by myself[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]     
Where pink Cadillacs and blue suede shoes[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Meet steel guitars and new grass blues[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
The music there, it ain't turned into business[/tab]

Tonight I'll be somewhere south of Memphis[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Where the cotton grows from the Mississippi mud[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]     
And the blues runs deep in you blood [/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch] 
I love this land with God as my witness [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
But I couldn't wait to get back home[/tab]

Well, they'll play you a, a front porch song for free
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
That reminds you that they ain't been free for long[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
Where them juke joints jump on a Friday night[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
And you don't need a gun to settle no fight[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
And come Sunday mornin', hell, you'll be beggin' for forgiveness[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
That's just life somewhere south of Memphis[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Where the cotton grows from the Mississippi mud[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
And the blues runs deep in your blood[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
I love this land with God as my witness[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]

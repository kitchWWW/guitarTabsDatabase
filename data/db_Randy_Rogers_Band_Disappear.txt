[tab][ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
It's no use; you've got a lock on your door[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
You'd be wise to realize what I've got is real[/tab]

But you're too busy burning bridges to know how you feel[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
I see you talking to him, just like you do everyone one[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Well he's getting lost but for you it's just fun[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
The way you mesmerize with those blue eyes and long curly hair[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                                           [ch]A[/ch]

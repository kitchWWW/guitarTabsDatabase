[Verse 1]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
I have heard how Christians   long ago[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Were brought before   a Tyrants Throne.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
They were told that He  would spare their lives[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
If   they would renounce the name of Christ.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
But one by one    they chose to die;[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]A[/ch]
   The Son of God they would not deny.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
Like a great angelic     choir sings,[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
I can almost   hear their voic  - es ring.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
I pledge allegiance   to   the Lamb,[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
with all my strength, with all I am.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
I will seek to hon-or   His   commands.[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
I pledge allegiance   to       the   Lamb.[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Now the years have come and the years have gone,[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]
and the cause of Je - sus still goes on.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
Now our time has come    to count the cost,[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
to   re-ject this world, to embrace the Cross.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
And one by one    let us live our lives[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]
for the One who died to give us life.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
â€˜Til the trumpet sounds     on the final day,[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
let us proudly stand and bold - ly say:[/tab]

with all my strength, with all I am.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
who took my place,   who wore my shame.[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]

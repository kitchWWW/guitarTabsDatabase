Looking for the working man's cafe in the shopping centre of the town[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch] 
Looking for somewhere to fit in, in among the retail outlets[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
Bought a pair of new designer pants where the fruit and veg man used to stand[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
I always used to see him there, selling old apples and pears[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]/B
Chatting up the pretty girls, with knocked off goods in the van[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]F/E[/ch]     
Don't you know, he was a working man[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]F/E[/ch]     
Long ago, he was a working man[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]
And we sat in the working man's cafe[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
The working man's cafe[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
Everything around me seems unreal, everywhere I go it looks and feels[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Gsus4[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Like Ame--rica[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]
You've really come a long way down this road, approving our surroundings as we go[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]Gsus4[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
Changing our roots and culture, but don't you know[/tab]

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]F/E[/ch]
Long ago, there was a working man[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]F/E[/ch]
Don't you know, we were all working men[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]
And we'd sit and pass the time of day[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
At the working man's cafe[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
I thought I knew you then, but will I know you now[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
There's got to be a place for us to meet,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
I call you when I've found it[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
I only hope that life has made us a little more grounded[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]             
Hey man, I see you now![/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]/E     
Oh Oh, we were all working men[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]D7[/ch]
And here we are at the working man's cafe[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
It's really good to see us come so far, but haven't we forgotten who we are[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch] 
Taking out a larger loan, equity relief and mortgages[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
We all seem to pass the time of day, online at the internet cafe[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And if you forget my face, in case you've forgotten just who I am[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]/B
I'm the kid with the greasy spoon, firmly held in my hand[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]F/E[/ch]
Don't you know, I was a working man[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]F/E[/ch]
Long ago, we were all working men [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
And we sat and spent the time of day[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
At the working man's cafe[/tab]

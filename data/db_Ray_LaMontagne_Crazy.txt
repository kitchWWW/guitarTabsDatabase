[Intro]

[ch]Gm[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Cm7[/ch] [ch]D7[/ch]


[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                                                     [ch]F[/ch]
I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind [/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]Cm7[/ch]
There was something so pleasant about that face. [/tab]

Even your emotions had an echo 
[tab]           [ch]D7[/ch]
In so much space [/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]
And when you're out there [/tab]

Without care,   
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]
Yeah, I was out of touch [/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Cm7[/ch]
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D7[/ch]
I just knew too much [/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]                  [ch]Gm[/ch]
Does that make me crazy [/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]
Does that make me crazy [/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Cm7[/ch]
Does that make me crazy [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D7[/ch]
PROBABLY[/tab]


[Verse 3]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                               [ch]F[/ch]
And I hope that you are having the time of your life [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Cm7[/ch]
But think twice [/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D7[/ch]
That's my only advice [/tab]

[tab][ch]Gm[/ch]                                            [ch]F[/ch]
Come on now, who do you, who do you think you are [/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Cm7[/ch]
Woah Woah bless your soul [/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D7[/ch]
You really think you're in control [/tab]

 
[Chorus]

[tab]                     [ch]Gm[/ch]
Well, I think you're crazy [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]
I think you're crazy [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Cm7[/ch]
I think you're crazy [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D7[/ch]
Just like me [/tab]


[Verse 4]

[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]F[/ch]              
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Cm7[/ch]                                     [ch]D7[/ch]  
And all I remember Is thinking, I want to be like them [/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]F[/ch]
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun [/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Cm7[/ch]
And it's no coincidence I've come [/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D7[/ch]
And I can die when I'm done [/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
But maybe I'm crazy [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]
Maybe you're crazy [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Cm7[/ch]
Maybe we're crazy[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D7[/ch] 
Probably[/tab]

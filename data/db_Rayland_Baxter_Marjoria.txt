Artist: Rayland Baxter
Song: Marjoria
Genre: 
Key: F#


Another great Rayland Baxter song. This one I play with capo 4 to avoid the barre chords. If you want a closer
sound, transpose two up and put the capo on 2; if you're feeling brave, try four up and remove the capo 
entirely.

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
N.C.
I was told by a man in a mirror
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
To let it all go this time[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
So I shook his hand and now everything's clearer[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
I did it myself this time[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
But there's no thanks for Marjoria[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em7[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
What did I do[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
No there's no thanks for Marjoria for these blues[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
Now there she goes like a train through my station[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
There used to be nothing to hide[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
There once was a friend, but now there's a stranger[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
That hides right behind those blue eyes[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
But there's no thanks for Marjoria[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em7[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
What did I do[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
No there's no thanks for Marjoria for these blues[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
But there's no thanks for Marjoria[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em7[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
What did I do[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
No there's no thanks for Marjoria for these blues[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
For these blues[/tab]

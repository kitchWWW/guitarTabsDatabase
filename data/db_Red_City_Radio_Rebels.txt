N.C.
They're only rebels 'cause they like the songs

[Verse]

[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah, there was anger, there was danger[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
There was violence, there was blood[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
There was confusion and illusion[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
All solutions in the mud[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
As we were standing up for justice, in the corner I see[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
I ain't lying, you were crying[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Holding on to your knees[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]

[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
I always knew that you were running from something[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]
Maybe I just didn't know you're running scared[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
From a ghost that you created, baby[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
When you look back is there nothing there?[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
And you can run as fast as the sun[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
Or maybe only as fast as this car will go[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]F[/ch]
And you could take your bullshit east or west[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
I don't give a shit - all I know is that[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]

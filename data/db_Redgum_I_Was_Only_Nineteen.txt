Artist: Redgum
Song: I Was Only Nineteen
Genre: 
Key: 


Capo on 3rd in some live versions

First I'll preface by saying that A and Am in this song sound extremely similar, and you can play either in
the verses. Personally I play Am as it has a more solemn feel but when they play live, they play a regular A.

The picking pattern for the song is easy once you get your head around it. It alternates between the bass note
and the D string, with the exception of the D chord where it plays the A string. With the strings numbered 1
through 6, with 1 being the high E, and "bass" being the bass note, the picking pattern goes like this:

bass 1 3 2 4 1 3 2 bass 1 3 2 4 1 3 2

I believe the chorus is the same, but I'm not sure. I usually strum the chorus anyway. Now to the actual song.

Mum and Dad and Denny saw the passing-out parade at Puckapunyal[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
It was a long march from cadets.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
The sixth battalion was the next to tour, and it was me who drew the card.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
We did Canungra, Shoalwater before we left.[/tab]

And Townsville lined the footpaths as we marched down to the quay[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
This clipping from the paper shows us young and strong and clean.[/tab]

And there's me in my slouch hat with my SLR and greens.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
God help me, I was only nineteen.[/tab]

From Vung Tau, riding Chinooks, to the dust at Nui Dat[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
I'd been in and out of choppers now for months.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
But we made our tents a home, VB and pinups on the lockers[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
And an Asian orange sunset through the scrub.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
And can you tell me, doctor, why I still can't get to sleep?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
And night-time's just a jungle dark and a barking M16?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
And what's this rash that comes and goes, can you tell me what it means?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
God help me, I was only nineteen.[/tab]

A four week operation when each step could mean your last one on two legs[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
It was a war within yourself.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
But you wouldn't let your mates down til they had you dusted off[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
So you closed your eyes and thought about something else.[/tab]

[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
Then someone yelled out "Contact!" and the bloke behind me swore[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
We hooked in there for hours, then a Godalmighty roar[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]

[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]

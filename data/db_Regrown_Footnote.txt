Artist: Regrown
Song: Footnote
Genre: 
Key: E


Not perfect but the closest I could get from ear. Verse 2 goes immediately into the chorus, in the recorded
version there's two guys singing and the words "talk" and "if i'm just" overlap.
*- Strum once


 [Verse 1]
[tab]N.C.      [ch]E[/ch]
I've been trying to write the perfect song[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
I've been trying to write the perfect chorus[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
But everything that I do, it all just brings me right back to this[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]
And I'm stuck, I'm not enough[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
Do you see me as just a crutch[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
Or as something you really need?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
If I'm just a footnote in your life[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
Then what the hell are you in mine?[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]E[/ch]
'Cause I’ve been down for so damn long[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
And it still haunts me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
Yeah, it still haunts me[/tab]

[ch]E[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]

[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
You fell away from me into a faded memory[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
But we still know everything[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
We went back occasionally[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
What’s lost is better off[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]
This hurt was never worth thе cost[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
All you wanted to do was talk[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
But you used to walk the walk, you talk thе talk[/tab]

[Chorus]
If I’m just a footnote in your life
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
Then what the hell are you in mine?[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]
'Cause I've been down for so damn long[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
And it still haunts me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
If all I am was just a crutch[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
For you to lean and to stand on[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
I sure hope to God that you are still here standing[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]*
When I die remember me[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]*
Through all the smiles on my friends faces[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]*                                     [ch]A[/ch]*
And all the laughs that I gave them when they were hurting[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
When I’m gone remember m[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Through all the songs that I kept singing[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
When I was too broken and beaten to keep going[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
If I’m just a footnote in your life[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
Then what the hell are you in mine?[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]
'Cause I've been down for so damn long[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
And it still haunts me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
If all I am was just a crutch[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
For you to lean and to stand on[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
I sure hope to God that you are still here standing[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
Are you still standing?[/tab]

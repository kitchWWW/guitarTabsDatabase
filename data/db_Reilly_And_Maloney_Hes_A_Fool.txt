[tab][ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]                                                           
Told me that he didn't love me, told me that he didn't want to share[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                                                                            
His time with me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                                        
But that's all right, he's one more guy who doesn't see[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]                                                 
The light in front of his eyes, he's gonna be[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]                                                                               
The one who cries[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]

He's got the wrong set of values, I'd like to set him straight[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]

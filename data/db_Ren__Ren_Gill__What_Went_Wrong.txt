[Sam:]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
It was a Friday night[/tab]
Not sure what I've taken
But I'm high tonight
There was a subtle shaking
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
In my left and right[/tab]
Got confused mistaken stuck in a matrix then my best friend says to me

[Ren:]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Sammy boy[/tab]
Why you faded on the sofa
Let's blow this joint
Bring yourself up out the coma
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
And toke this joint[/tab]
And we'll jump into your car
Put the pedal to the floor
Bruv don't disappoint

[Sam:]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Bro I'm not in the right mind frame[/tab]
I've had several shots and I'm out my brain
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
And it's really not the right time to be drivin[/tab]
The smoke in my eyelids and I just wanna chill here

[Ren:]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Don't be a pussy[/tab]
Don't beat around the bushy
I'm in the mood to boogie cus I'm on the Buzz
You're Woody
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Man get up on the sofa[/tab]
Stand up like a soldier
Keep that composure
Tonight could be golden

Instrumental Break
[ch]Am[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] X2

[Sam:]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Okay man I'm feeling kinda wake but[/tab]
You was the plan
[tab]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
Pass me the keys and I'll grab the can[/tab]
Keep your eyes on the rear and look out for the cops while I focus on the steering wheel

[Ren:]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Fuck the police comin' straight out the underground[/tab]
We'll run around town with this whipped like
A thunder cloud
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Proud yes my brother[/tab]
Youâ€™re Michael Schumaker
Stop driving like a bitch
And start burning some rubber

[Sam (Ren):]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
Alright fuck it, you wanna see my drive? (Yeah)[/tab]
Clock the dial
Watch how it climbs
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Pass me the beer[/tab]
Pass me that spliff
I'm about to get down on some Hamilton shit

[Ren:]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
There's the boy that I know[/tab]
A boy that I love
Fuck a beer here's a bottle of tequila, my brother
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]
I knew when push came to shove[/tab]
She wouldn't let me down
Now it's GTA V up in Brighton town

[Sam:]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Not gonna pump the break[/tab]
Till the gas explodes
Pull a handbrake turn
While I smoke my o's
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Bruv you are right[/tab]
Man you always know
Wait fuck! what the fuck is that in the road?

[ch]Am[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Where am I?[/tab]
What is this?
Blood on my brow
Trembling wrist
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Where's my friend?[/tab]
Where's he gone?
I think I crashed
What went wrong?

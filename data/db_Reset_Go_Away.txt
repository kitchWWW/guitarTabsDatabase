Good song. There was no five-star tab so I thought I would try to make one.

If I ever went to a Simple Plan concert and met Pierre Bouvier I would get him 
to sign my Reset CD xD.

As always please rate and comment and enjoy. :)

And for a little bonus heres the lyrics ;)

Won't you understand
that we don't give a shit what you demand
your values never meant anything to us
we don't give a shit

petitions signed, parents standing in a line
just to stop their kids who wanna hear
what we have to say

when you were a little younger
your dream was to become a rocker
now it seems that it's what you hate
I never will
go to hell
it's what my friends want me to tell
what you do is what I hate
I hate you

[Chorus]
Go away, I don't want you on my tape
Go away, I don't want you in my face
Go Away, I don't want you on My tape
fuck the pmrc

tipper won't you understand
the message that I want to say
it's kind of rude but here it goes it's fuck you
I don't like what you do
and I don't like you

[Chorus]
Go away, I don't want you on my tape
Go away, I don't want you in my face
Go Away, I don't want you on My tape

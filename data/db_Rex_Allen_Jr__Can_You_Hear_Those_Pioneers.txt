When I was just a little boy I learned to call the cows[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G7[/ch]
From Eddy Arnold singing strong a-bout the Cattle Call[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]F[/ch]
And I'll never forget the Pioneers singing "See them tumbling down"[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G7[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Well, I think it's time that we put Western back in the Country sound[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Ev'ry time that I hear Rex sing about his 'Arizona Sky'[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G7[/ch]
Or Roy and Dale's "Happy Trails", they always bring a sigh![/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                                          [ch]F[/ch]
My throat gets tight then the tears come "See them tumbling down"[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G7[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
But, I think it's time that we put Western back in the Country sound.[/tab]

[Refrain]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]
Can you hear those pi-io-neers[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]C[/ch]
Singing 'bout cool, clear water[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G7[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
While they're headin' for the last roundup.[/tab]

[Verse 3]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Oh, how I wish that I could be "Back In The Saddle" with Gene[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]G7[/ch]
But days like that I live again only in my dreams[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]
And when I hear Tex sing 'High Noon' my heart comes tumbling down[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G7[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Well, I think it's time that we put Western back in the Country sound.[/tab]

[Refrain]

Can you hear those pi-io-neers[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]C[/ch]
Singing 'bout cool, clear water[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G7[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
While they're headin' for the last roundup.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Yes, I think it's time that we put Western[/tab]
[tab][ch]G7[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Back in the Country sound.[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab]                                 [ch]C#[/ch]
Why I always feel like I'm on a time limit[/tab]

Fuckin' moonlight all in my business
[tab]                           [ch]C#m[/ch]
Studio, I spend a night in it[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]                      [ch]F#[/ch]

Poppa kidney, still workin' backwards[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]                        [ch]C#[/ch]
Wish I was doctor, fuck a rapper[/tab]
N.C.
Thought he was good when he beat the cancer
[tab]                                            [ch]F#m[/ch]
He was sick afterwards, I thought that was standard[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]B[/ch]
Sometimes I wonder the fuck am I prayin' for?[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F#m[/ch]
My momma hate, I question the lord[/tab]
N.C.
There's a higher power, I believe in that
[tab]                              [ch]B[/ch]
I question where he put that evil at[/tab]

Why I be tragedy, where all my people at?
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
When we the main ones in the churches[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]B[/ch]                                                    [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]C#[/ch]
Tithes and offerin' on your car payment, while the pastor's Mercedes Benz swervin', damn[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
But maybe I think too much, uh[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
Maybe I close my eyes and I dream too much[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I just can't be gullible, girl I've seen too much[/tab]
[tab]                                              [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C#m[/ch]

[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]
First I'm here then I'm not around[/tab]

At your house and I'm on the road
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
In your bed and then in my mode[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]

[tab]      [ch]F#[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C#[/ch]

Tight rope, but I don't slip
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Finish line like a million miles[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I just hope you down for the road trip[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]C#m[/ch]

Another trucker stumbles up the steps into my kiosk for directions,[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Too wasted to see the map I'm showing him.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
He wanted to bust the glass... 'cause I wouldn't give him gas-- [/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]
I said, "You shouldn't even be driving.[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]
Just take a nap until the morning time and hit the road."[/tab]
 
 
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]D/C#[/ch] root      [ch]D/C[/ch] root
I wish I had a pistol just to take him down with myself.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
Who's to tell?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]/[ch]Em[/ch]
No one said this would be easy...[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
But no one said this would be hell.[/tab]
 
 
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Mom and Dad are selfless... and they don't do nothing worthless.[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]G[/ch]
They just work all day and worry about their son:[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
"What went wrong with Martin? Is he dumb?"[/tab]
 
 
[tab]                [ch]D/C#[/ch]          [ch]D/C[/ch]
I just pump gas every weekday night[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Until the sun comes up like missiles... to my brain.[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]D[/ch]
You never said this would be hell.[/tab]
 
 
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Oh... with all the colours in closed eyes:[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
Blue and black of veins all bleed to one.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]Bm[/ch]
Come with me tonight... To say that this is anything [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
Is saying much too much.[/tab]
 
 
Let's go.  
 
[ch]D[/ch]////[ch]D[/ch]-[ch]A[/ch]-[ch]D[/ch]
 
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]D/C#[/ch] bass
I see the sun is bleeding.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D/C[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
The morning time has come... It's not that bad.[/tab]
 
Oh, no.
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]/[ch]Em[/ch]
No one said I would be king-like,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
But no one said I could be had![/tab]

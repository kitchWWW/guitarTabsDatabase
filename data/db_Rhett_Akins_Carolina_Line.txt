Rhett Akins - Carolina Line



Intro: [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]D/F#[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Asus[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]             [ch]D/F#[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
I guess she caught that plane early this morning[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
'cause her I've-decided-to-stay call never came[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]D/F#[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
and right about now lord she's nearly back to Asheville[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]Asus[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
I'm staring out at a south Georgia rain[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Asus[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
wondering if I'll ever touch her again[/tab]


Chorus:
[tab]               [ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
If there were only miles between us[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
I'd be there in a good day's drive[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
but the last time I held her[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Asus[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
I saw the distance in her eyes[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
she once crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
and swore that she'd be mine[/tab]
[tab][ch]D/F#[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Asus[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]D/F#[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Asus[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
but she never brought her heart across the Carolina line[/tab]


She always said this place felt just like home
but there were memories she never did unpack
and even in my arms holding me close
she never let go of the past
or the one who kept calling her back


Chorus:
If there were only miles between us
I'd be there in a good day's drive
but the last time I held her
I saw the distance in her eyes
she must've missed those Blue Ridge Mountains
or someone she left behind                      
'cause I never got her heart across the Carolina line


Instrumental


When she crossed the Blue Ridge mountains
and left me here behind
Lord knows she took my heart across that Carolina line

Start of song. Before the first lyric[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You say you've lived most your life with a broken heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#M[/ch]
The only way you know to fall is to fall apart[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You're scared to trust yourself[/tab]
[tab][ch]EM[/ch]
To choose who you can trust[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Well, that makes two of us[/tab]

You can't count the times someone has let you down
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Tore you all to pieces, turned you inside out[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
There's a part of you that's a livin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
On the edge of givin' up[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
That makes two of us[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
One thing we have in common[/tab]

We're no strangers to the bottom
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And the only place to go from here is up[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Had trials and tribulations[/tab]

Wondered if we're just forsaken
Em.                                     A
If you're thinking we deserve a shot of love
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Well, That makes two of us[/tab]

There's a cloud of hesiration raining in your eyes
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
You're afraid a storm is coming with one more goodbye[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You don't want to take a chance[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
But you want to be that rush[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Well, That makes two of us[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
One thing we have in common[/tab]

We're no strangers to the bottom
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And the only place to go from there is up[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Had trials and tribulations[/tab]

Wondered if we're just forsaken
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
If you're thinking we deserve a shot at love[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Well, that makes two of us[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
When we both met it wasn't just blind luck[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]  
You... looked just like my mother[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Did when she was 19[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Not afraid to die[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I... started planning our future[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
You were just 19[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Still a firefly[/tab]

You got... terrible vision
You shoulda seen I was leavin'
When I first appeared
I... got bit by the footlights
I got caught in the headlights
in any place but here

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Never say[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You'll never leave[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]    [ch]G/F#[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]Em7[/ch]
Cuz you'll never know til you try[/tab]
In a jar
fireflies
Only last for one night
Only last for one night


Trains roll... like gamblers in slow mo
Tryin' to find good luck
When they couldn't find love

Oh yeah, and I'm... gonna sleep on the train tracks
It's gonna be a peaceful night
Then it's gonna get rough

Never say
You'll never leave
Cuz you'll never know til you try
In a jar
fireflies
Only last for one night
Only last for one night

I must have had a reason for leavin'[/tab]
- Not one I could see
I must have had a reason for leavin'
- Must have been me
- Must have been me...

You... looked just like my mother
Did when she was 19
Not afraid to die

For the last time... I'm not your mother
And I was only 19
I'm still a firefly

[Intro]
N.C.
The more that I spend next to you is the more I get sicker
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Oh-Oh[/tab]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                         [ch]Am7[/ch]
 Greying skies and rays of sunshine[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Peeking through the curtains of the summertime[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Am7[/ch]
Sandy cars and your browning thighs[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Kissing on your body til the sunrise[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Am7[/ch]
Every day I put on my protection[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
This big world is full of cruel people like you[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Am7[/ch]
All I ask is your time and affection[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Lately all I get is goodbye, thank you[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Am7[/ch]
Please don't change your[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Please don't change your mind[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am7[/ch]                                                [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
I don't have the time to go back on my word when I said that I'd be fine[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Am7[/ch]
Now I'm gonna go and take my words back[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Pages from my past, don't be a copycat[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Am7[/ch]
Hold my head up high cause I deserve that[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Deserve it, deserve it all[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                               [ch]Am7[/ch]
Why you asking where I'm gonna be?[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
You should, you should, you should know this[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]Am7[/ch]
One more drink and I'll be straight to sleep[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
It's a Friday night, babe, but nevermind that, nevermind that[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am7[/ch]
If it's me you seek[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
I'll be waiting in the dragon's keep[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Am7[/ch]
Building my protection as we speak[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
But we both know I'm hoping that you breach in, I pray you hear my preaching, I pray you hear me[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]                           [ch]Am7[/ch]
There's resistance in your kiss, boy[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
There's a tension in your eyes[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Am7[/ch]
Why you've got to drift apart?[/tab]
[tab]                                                   [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Only come out after dark, I don't want to feed you lies[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Am7[/ch]
Maybe there's a reason that you wanna go[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
I should start reflecting back on my M.O.[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Am7[/ch]
You happen to fit my favorite type cast[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
You are living proof to me I fall too fast, yeah[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                               [ch]Am7[/ch]
Why you asking where I'm gonna be?[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
You should, you should, you should know this[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]Am7[/ch]
One more smoke and I'll be straight to sleep[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
It's a Friday night, babe, but nevermind that, nevermind that[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am7[/ch]
If it's me you seek[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
I'll be waiting in the dragon's keep[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Am7[/ch]
Building my protection as we speak[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
But we both know I'm hoping that you breach in, I pray you hear my preaching, I pray you hear me[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]                  [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Fall, fall, fall too fast[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Am7[/ch]                  [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
Don't you know you fall, fall, fall too fast[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am7[/ch]
The more that I wait, the more it gets bigger (fall, fall, fall)[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
The more that I spend next to you is the more I get sicker (too fast)[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Am7[/ch]                  [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
(Don't you know you fall, fall, fall too fast?)[/tab]

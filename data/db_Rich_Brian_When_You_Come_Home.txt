[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
What have you been getting into[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
It's been quite a while since I've seen you, my friend[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
They had a discount for these blue shoes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
They looked like the ones that would suit you[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
But I wasn't sure if your size has changed[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Steam from my nose when I'm breathing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I can't take my mind off that evening[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]
But maybe I'll forget if I sleep[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Talk to you when I was dreaming[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
What are you doing this weekend?[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]
You always make me laugh when you speak[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
And you always thought my laugh was funny[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
So one day, if you find your way[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
I'll be waiting for you[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Cm6[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
Tell me 'bout all the things that you did[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
How was your trip?[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]Cm6[/ch]         [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
I got all these questions to ask but I'll save them for when you come home[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Barefoot in my place just to keep it clean[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I hated when you didn't do the same[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
But the floor in my house misses your shoes[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]
We were cooking and I couldn't taste the meat[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
You agreed and then you grabbed the salt for me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
And I still wish that I said thank you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Whether it's hot or too cold to breathe[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I know that you're finding some place to sleep[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
You always love to prepare for the storm[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I hope you make friends that you hate to leave[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Even though it's not something that you would need[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bm[/ch]
I know that you could stand on your own[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]
And trust me I don't mean to rush you[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]
But if one day if you find your way[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
I'll be waiting for you[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Cm6[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
Tell me 'bout all the things that you did[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
How was your trip?[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]Cm6[/ch]         [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]
I got all these questions to ask but I'll save them for when you come home[/tab]

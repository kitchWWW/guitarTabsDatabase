I always start to finish just before you start to come up[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]Bsus4[/ch]                [ch]C5[/ch]     [ch]A2[/ch]
Im at the top of the staircase as your elevator catches up[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
If you're ever looking up and see that I'm falling down[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bsus4[/ch]
Please don't judge me for the noise just remember the sound[/tab]
[tab][ch]C5[/ch]
If you knew what's in my head[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bsus4[/ch]                  [ch]A2[/ch]
you probably wouldn't be so impressed[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
We were downstairs  I was up in my head[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bsus4[/ch]
convincing myself that we weren't[/tab]

Sewn from the same thread
[tab][ch]C5[/ch]
I was wrong[/tab]

The shell was all misaligned
[tab]     [ch]A2[/ch]
So I back-stepped the seam[/tab]

And told myself I'd be fine


[Bridge]

[tab][ch]C5[/ch]
Love is cool[/tab]

Love is fine
[tab]        [ch]Bsus4[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Love is wondering if I have the time[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
If you're ever looking up and see that I'm falling down[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bsus4[/ch]
Please don't judge me for the noise just remember the sound[/tab]
[tab][ch]C5[/ch]
If you knew what's in my head[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bsus4[/ch]                  [ch]A2[/ch]
you probably wouldn't be so impressed[/tab]


[Ending]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
We were downstairs and I was up in my head[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bsus4[/ch]
convincing myself that we weren't[/tab]

Sewn from the same thread
[tab][ch]C5[/ch]
I was wrong[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bsus4[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
And it took so long[/tab]

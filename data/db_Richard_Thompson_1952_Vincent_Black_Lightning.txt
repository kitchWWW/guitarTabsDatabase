[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]

Come down, come down, Red Molly, called Sergeant MacRae[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
For they've taken young James for armed robbery[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
Come down, Red Molly to his dying bedside[/tab]

He was running out of road, he was running out of breath[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]Am/B[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
But he smiled to see her cry[/tab]

Said young James, in my opinion, there's nothing in this world[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
Beats a 52 Vincent and a red headed girl[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                         [ch]C[/ch]
Now Nortons and Indians and Greeves won't do[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
They don't have a soul like a Vincent 52[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
I see angels and ariels in leather and chrome[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Swooping down from heaven to carry me home[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]Am/B[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]

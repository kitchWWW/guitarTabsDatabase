[Verse 1]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Well there's a house in an alley[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
In the squats and low-rise[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
Of a town with no future[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
But that's where my future lies[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
It's a secret, but no secret [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
It's a rule, but no rule[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
Where you find the darkest avenue[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
There you'll find the brightest jewel[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
Now my name it is Mulvaney[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
And I'm known quite famously[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
People speak my name in whispers[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
What higher praise can there be?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
But I'd trade my fine mohair[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
For tied-dyes and faded jeans[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
If she wanted me some other way[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
She's my Cooksferry Queen[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
She gave me one pill to get bigger[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
She gave me one pill to get small[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
I saw snakes dancing all around her feet[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And Dead men coming throught the wall[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Well I'm the prince of this parish[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
I've been ruthless and I've been mean[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
But she blew my mind as she opened my eyes[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
She's my Cooksferry Queen[/tab]

[Solo]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Well she's got every rare perfection[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
All her looks beyond compare[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
She's got dresses that seem to float in the wind[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Pre-Raphaelite curls in her hair[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
She could get the lame to walking[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
She could get the blind to see[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
She could make wine out of Thames river water[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
She could make a believer out of me[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
All the wicked things I've been[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
She's my bright jewel of the alley[/tab]

She's my Cooksferry Queen[/tab]

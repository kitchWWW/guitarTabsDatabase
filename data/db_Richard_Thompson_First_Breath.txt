Let's love What's left
like new born First breath

Old star new shine
Old cup new wine

Sun rise Moon glow
Someday We'll know

Inch by inch
Word by word
The lock is sprung
That caged the bird

Let's love What's left
Last dance First breath
Last dance First breath
Last dance First breath

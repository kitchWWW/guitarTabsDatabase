[ch]G[/ch]) Ray Thaves at 2am ([ch]C[/ch]) sitting towards the back ([ch]Em[/ch]) of a ([ch]D[/ch]) Greyhound ([ch]C[/ch])
([ch]G[/ch]) He sits next to an overweight ([ch]C[/ch]) lady with metal braces on both her legs,
([ch]Em[/ch]) and she sits there ([ch]D[/ch]) coughing ([ch]C[/ch])
([ch]Em[/ch]) He tries to just look out the ([ch]G[/ch]) window into the desert
where it's ([ch]C[/ch]) 5 degrees below zero ([ch]G[/ch])

([ch]G[/ch]) Having to move back into his ([ch]C[/ch]) uncle's house in Las Vegas
([ch]Em[/ch]) with no ([ch]D[/ch]) money, ([ch]C[/ch]) no apartment,([ch]G[/ch]) and no car and no ([ch]C[/ch]) motorcycle,
([ch]Em[/ch]) his music ([ch]D[/ch]) collection gone, ([ch]C[/ch]) everything's been pawned
([ch]G[/ch]) And the guy behind him ([ch]C[/ch]) keeps getting up and going to the bathroom
([ch]Em[/ch]) says he's been ([ch]D[/ch]) up for days and the ([ch]C[/ch]) speed's still showing
([ch]Em[/ch]) Ray tries to just stare out the ([ch]G[/ch]) window,
snow covers everything and it's([ch]C[/ch]) 5 degrees below zero

([ch]G[/ch]) Above him is a sea of stars ([ch]C[/ch]) unseen because of the weather
([ch]Em[/ch]) He tries not to ([ch]D[/ch]) look at his reflection ([ch]C[/ch]) in the window,
([ch]G[/ch]) And there's two guys in front of him ([ch]C[/ch]) who are quietly drinking off a bottle
([ch]Em[/ch]) And he can ([ch]D[/ch]) feel that ([ch]C[/ch]) feel, feel that feel still pulling
([ch]G[/ch]) A girl across the aisle is ([ch]C[/ch]) giving herself an ink pen tattoo
([ch]Em[/ch]) her kid ([ch]D[/ch]) sits next to her ([ch]C[/ch]) and her kid is crying
([ch]G[/ch]) So he finally gets up and ([ch]C[/ch]) walks to the front of the bus,
([ch]Em[/ch]) to the ([ch]D[/ch]) bus driver ([ch]C[/ch])
[tab]([ch]C[/ch]) "Pull Over! ([ch]G[/ch]) Pull Over!" he yells at the bus driver, and
the bus driver he just pulls over[/tab]


(G) He gets off the bus in just his (C) T-shirt and leaves his coat
and all his things aboard
(Em) and as the (D) bus pulls away (C) he walks out into the desert
(G) And he can see the city lights (C) in the distance
(Em) so he (D) walks into the (C) opposite direction
(G) Swimming in a sea of rage that (C) dissipates with the cold
(Em) But hours now have (D) passed and he (C) doesn't know
which way to go
(Em) He tries to find the (G) highway but snow covers everything
and it's (C) 5 degrees below zero

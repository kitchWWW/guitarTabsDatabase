[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
Business man rich in his rolls-royce of gold[/tab]
Laughs at the beggar cause he’s poor and old
But the joke is on him as the homeless replies
I feel sorry for you with your money and lies

[tab][ch]C/G[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]   
He says look at my home the streets and the parks[/tab]
Look at my ceiling the stars in the dark
Take a look in the larder, the things that just grew
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
Take a look in the mirror, at me, you’ll see you.[/tab]


[tab][ch]C/G[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]   
Remember the weak, remember the poor[/tab]
Remember the junkie, remember the whore
Don’t just worship money or manner of things
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
Don’t just worship the bishop the lord and the kinggggsss[/tab]

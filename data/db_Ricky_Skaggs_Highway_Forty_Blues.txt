[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
Well these Highway Forty blues[/tab]

[tab][ch]D7[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
I've walked holes in both my shoes[/tab]

[tab]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Counted the days since I've been gone[/tab]

[tab][ch]D7[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
And I'd love to see the lights of home[/tab]

 
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
Wasted time and money too[/tab]

[tab][ch]D7[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Squandered youth in search of truth[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
But in the end I had to lose[/tab]

[tab]                        [ch]D7[/ch]
Lord above I've paid my dues[/tab]

[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Got the Highway Forty blues [/tab]

 
[tab]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
The highway called when I was young[/tab]

[tab][ch]D7[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Told me lies of things to come[/tab]

[tab]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
Fame and fortune lies ahead [/tab]

[tab][ch]D7[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
That's what the billboard lights had said[/tab]

 
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Shattered dreams my mind is numb [/tab]

[tab][ch]D7[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
My money's gone stick out my thumb[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
My eyes are filled with bitter tears [/tab]

[tab]                          [ch]D7[/ch]
Lord I ain't been home in years[/tab]

[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Got the Highway Forty blues[/tab]

 
[tab]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
You know I've rambled all around[/tab]

[tab][ch]D7[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
Like a rolling stone from town to town [/tab]

[tab]                           [ch]Am[/ch]
Met pretty girls I have to say[/tab]
 
[tab][ch]D7[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
But none of them could make me stay[/tab]

 
[tab]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
Well I've played the music halls and bars[/tab]

[tab][ch]D7[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
Had fancy clothes and big fine cars [/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
Things a country boy can't use [/tab]

[tab]                      [ch]D7[/ch]
Dixieland I sure miss you[/tab]

[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Got the Highway Forty blues[/tab]

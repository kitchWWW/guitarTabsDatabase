[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Doesn't feel like it's been long[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
It's been two years and then some[/tab]

Guess I'm slow at movin' on[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Moved away from our old home[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
It felt too wrong with you gone[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Miss the sunrise in our windows[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
And it's too late to write a lovesong[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
Drinkin' and dancin' into the night[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]

Wish I could say that I didn't mean to[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
But I gave in and I called you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
I said some things that weren't true[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]

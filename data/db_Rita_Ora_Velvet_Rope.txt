Guess we'll never know[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A/B[/ch]                     [ch]C#m7[/ch]
Is it hidden behind that velvet rope?[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F#m7[/ch]             [ch]A/B[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]
While I'm standing alone out in the cold[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]A/B[/ch]                         [ch]C#m7[/ch]
Or did you fool them all into thinking you're gold?[/tab]

(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
[tab]                     [ch]F#m7[/ch]                   [ch]A/B[/ch]

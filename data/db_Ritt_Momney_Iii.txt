[Verse 1]
[tab]       [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                     [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
All my friends, Are making their way[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
She’s in bed, And still feels the same[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am7[/ch]            [ch]D7[/ch]
But what's a feeling to the truth[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am7[/ch]              [ch]D7[/ch]
And I found no face in you[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                  [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
In you, But things always leave[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                 [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Some you'll choose, Some you will grieve[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am7[/ch]                    [ch]D7[/ch]
There will be dreams that don't come true[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am7[/ch]                    [ch]D7[/ch]
There will be things you thought you knew[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
You knew, Stay where you are[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Gmaj7[/ch]                   [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]   n.c.
Now I'm leaving you. But I won't go too far[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]        [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
I grew away from you, You're all alone in a mind made for two[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Emin7[/ch]     [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
But if the color starts to fade from view[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
Just put the paintbrush in your hand, Your hand[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
This year I changed in the sense that I didn't[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                [ch]Emin7[/ch]
This year I moved not by foot but by inch[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
This year I learned what she'd do to be smiled at[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                          [ch]Emin7[/ch]
This year the shape of my mouth never flinched[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
This year the good things were far less appealing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
This year the bad won me over for good[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
This year my tongue nearly lost all its feeling[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
This year my lips moved much more than they should[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
This year I grew till the sky filled my ears[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
With whispers of sadness I turned into songs[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
This year I learned I can sing to a crowd[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                          [ch]Emin7[/ch]
Much more honestly than I can talk to my mom[/tab]
n.c.
This year I wrote down some notes in my phone
n.c.
And later heard strangers recite every word
n.c.
This year I felt all their eyes and their ears
n.c.
I don't want to be seen I just want to be (Her and all my) heard


[Outro]
[tab]               [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Her and all my friends left me a year ago, Maybe more,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                      [ch]D[/ch]
I heard that time flies when you spend it though, so I (?)[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
I used to sleep and spawn tears, Those are gone[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                                     [ch]D[/ch]
I don't think I'll cry as long as I've still got my girlfriends and my songs here[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Speaking of the songs I'd like to thank you for the girlfriend[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                                                 [ch]D[/ch]
Speaking of the girlfriend thanks for staying here so long[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Speaking of the friends I'd like to thank you for the good times[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                                                      n.c.
And speaking of the her I’d like to thank you for the songs[/tab]

pray he never takes her away from me [x2][/tab]

and i know 82 years is a long long time
still i know thourght how to make her thourght just fine
i could be happy the hole rest of my life
i told jc how much i love her

pray he never takes her away from me [x2]

since the accident she knows there's nothing left
but alcohol let a simple promise to oblivion
still i gotta try and resist this substences abuse

prove to jc how much i love her
uh, jc, how much i love her
i told jesus how much i love her

why he had to take her away from me?
why he'd go and take her away from me? [x3]

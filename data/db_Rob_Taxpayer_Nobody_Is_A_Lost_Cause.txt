[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
My buddy Jeff blew his brains out[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
on the south shore of the lake[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]
A lifetime of whatever[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
was more than he could take.[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
He helped me build my house.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
He helped a lot of folks.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]
He gave his time and his money[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
He was perpetually broke.[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]
A few months before he did it,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
I was deep inside a hole,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                [ch]Em[/ch]
shame-filled for the things I had done.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]
He was the only one that saw me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
lost in the abyss...[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
Don't remember it exactly,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
but he said something like this:[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
"Everybody is broken, sad, and alone.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Everybody is drifting along without a home.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
Everybody is shattered and burdened with flaws.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Cm[/ch]
But nobody is a lost cause."[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
He had a tattoo on his arm[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
of a stupid cartoon man[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
poking out from behind a little wall.[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
If you asked him what it was,[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
he'd say, "That's Murphy.  You know Murphy's Law?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
Anything that can go wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
will go wrong."[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]
And it did.  And it will.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Again and again.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
For as long as we are all alive.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
When a person is stuck in a terrifying pit,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
only thing you can do[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
is try to help them out of it.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
"Everybody is broken, sad, and alone.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Everybody is drifting along without a home.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
Everybody is shattered and burdened with flaws.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Cm[/ch]
But nobody is a lost cause."[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
"Everybody is broken, sad, and alone.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Everybody is drifting along without a home.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
Everybody is shattered and burdened with flaws.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Cm[/ch]
But nobody is a lost cause."[/tab]

[Outro]

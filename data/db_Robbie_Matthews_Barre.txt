[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I'm learning how to play the guitar[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I know I'm going to be a big star[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
But people said - they know who they are[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
The best kind of chord to learn is the barre![/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
I've stretched all my fingers til they burn[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
Tried every angle and every wrist turn[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D7[/ch]
I think the movies lied when it became understood[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
A quick montage is all that it takes to get good![/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I want to play my guitar[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
On stage or on the roof of my car[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
But it feels like I won't get very far[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
If I have play the chord they call a barre..[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
You take your your fore-finger and lay it down flat[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Then move the other six it's as easy as that[/tab]
[tab][ch]D7[/ch]
You somehow stop other strings from being muted[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Feel the pain in the muscles that have contributed![/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Just so you know, it's spelled b-a-r-r-e[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
I think the other kind of bar is much more friendly[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D7[/ch]
I try and I try to get B or B minor..[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Wait... that sounded good, and couldn't be finer![/tab]

[Outro]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Now I'm going to play my guitar[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
In a park maybe, or under the stars[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Wow! I know I'm going to go far[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Now I know how to play a chord they called a barre...[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Now I know how to play a chord they called a barre...[/tab]

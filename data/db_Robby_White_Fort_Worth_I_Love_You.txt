[ch]A[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
I broke jail in Oconee, Georgia, changed my name to Jimmy Bill[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
I was wanted for some time that I had killed[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
See, I shot down Martha Hawkins, hell I robbed her of her pride[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
I chose Forth Worth as a place to hide[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                                         [ch]A[/ch]
Well, them Georgia jails don't have such a beautiful view[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                                     [ch]E[/ch]
And Fort Worth's such a wonderful town to disappear into[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
On the muscle up my arm there's a red and blue tattoo[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
It says, Fort Worth I love you (and I do)[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                            [ch]D[/ch]
Fort Worth town is the best I've found for a hangaround like me[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]
I get stoned and watch the rodeo on T.V[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
('cause) Here in Texas, killin' time's no crime, but now I'm in the clear[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
And I know Martha Hawkins won't find me here[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                                           [ch]A[/ch]
Well, them Georgia prisons don't have such a beautiful view[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                                     [ch]E[/ch]
And Fort Worth's such a wonderful town to disappear into[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Well, Saturday night at 8 o'clock I know where I'm gonna go[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                                                      [ch]E[/ch]
I'm a-gonna pick my baby up and take her to the picture show[/tab]
[tab]                                                          [ch]A[/ch]
Everybody in the neighborhood is dressin' up to be there, too, ooh, ooh[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]B7[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
And we're gonna have a ball just like we always do[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
Saturday night at the movies, who cares what picture you see[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]B7[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
When you're huggin' with your baby in the last row of the balcony?[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Well, there's Technicolor and Cinemascope, and a cast out of Hollywood[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                                                              [ch]E[/ch]
And the popcorn from the candy stand makes it all seem twice as good[/tab]
[tab]                                                                   [ch]A[/ch]
There's alway lots of pretty girls with figures they don't try to hide, hide[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]B7[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
But they never can compare to the girl sittin' by my side[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
Saturday night at the movies, who cares what picture you see[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]B7[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
When you're huggin' with your baby in the last row of the balcony?[/tab]

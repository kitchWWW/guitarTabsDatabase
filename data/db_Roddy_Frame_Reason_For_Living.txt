[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                   [ch]G[/ch]
Now you're back in my arms again, let your heart be rearranged[/tab]
[tab]                                          [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
while you were sleeping the reaper's been reaping, the times have changed[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]
Speak softly to me you have more power than the bomb[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
the tears in your eyes are just medals and prizes, the war is over[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]Bbdim7[/ch]     [ch]Bm7[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
Miracles will come and go watch it all work out        but don't give in[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
If you should climb to the top of the world just to take it on the chin[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
what would would it matter if the world were to shatter, is it the world you believe in[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
You crawl to the ends of the earth as the sceneries caving in[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
on knees burnt by gravel the seasons unravel, your reason for living   (S o l o)[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                                  [ch]G[/ch]
With flesh and blood and small change, we start a little something new[/tab]
[tab]                                               [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
rather lead and be mistaken than following and faking, for the sake of seeming true[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]Bbdim7[/ch]     [ch]Bm7[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
all the stars and satellites shine down on you        but which will you heed[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
If you should climb to the top of the world just to take it on the chin[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
what would would it matter if the world seemed to shatter, is it the world you believe in[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
You crawl to the ends of the earth as the sceneries caving in[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
on knees burnt by gravel the seasons unravel, your reason for living[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
If I should drown in the light of your eyes, well I'd rather die giving[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
walk the line with some grace say it wasn't a race ain't that a reason for living?[/tab]

verse 2
        A star above the city in the northern chill
        A baby being born to the overkill
        No say no place to go
        A T.V. and a radio

Pre-chorus
        Ambition and love wearing boxing gloves
        And singing hearts and flowers

Chorus   play once end on the C

        "in the round", its very easy, enjoy.

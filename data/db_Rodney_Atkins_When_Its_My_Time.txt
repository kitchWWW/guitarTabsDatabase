[Intro]
| ([ch]D[/ch])  | ([ch]G[/ch])  | ([ch]Em[/ch])  | ([ch]A[/ch])  |  x 2

[Verse]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
I was late for work, had to pull to the side while a funeral train of cars drove by[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
With their lights on, it was just my luck, it went on and on for miles[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
I kept checkin' my watch, grittin' my teeth, then suddenly it dawned on me[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
That who- ever this is, is gonna be missed for a long, long time,[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
It got me thinking[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
When it's my time to go, the end of my road I hope it looks like this[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
200 cars stretched out as far as the hearts I touched while I lived[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]F#m[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
And I hope I leave half as much love be- hind when it's my time[/tab]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
So I followed that last car down to the church, took off my ball cap, tucked in my shirt[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
I just had to see what kind of life could cause such as traffic jam[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Heard story after story, people laugh, people cry, it didn't take long to understand[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Why every pew was full, there's a lot of good souls made better for knowing him[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
And now I'm one of them[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
When it's my time to go, the end of my road I hope it looks like this[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
200 cars stretched out as far as the hearts I touched while I lived[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]F#m[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
And I hope I leave half as much love be- hind when it's my time[/tab]

Felt a hand on my back, turned a- round, someone asked, "Did you know him well?"[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
And I said, "Yeah, well enough to know"[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
When it's my time to go, the end of my road I hope it looks like this[/tab]

200 cars stretched out as far as the hearts I touched while I lived[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]F#m[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]F#m[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
And I hope I leave half as much love be- hind when it's my time[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Ooh, when it's my time[/tab]

Genre: 
Key: 


[tab]     [ch]G[/ch] 
On a highway to nowhere[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Big city lights in my rearview mirror[/tab]
Adjust my eyes
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
As the sun goes down I speak and I forget[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
The sound of the dark[/tab]
Listen to the rain
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
And the radio's off but no one complains[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
I drive all by myself and wait for the day[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Some may leave and some may lie[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Some they kneel and some they fly[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
Some they lead and some they fall behind[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
With nothing left to lose[/tab]

(second verse same as the first)
The things you forgive and learn to forget
In the pitch black dark
Recall what it meant to believe in things you can't feel with your hands

If there's fire on the ground or floods on the streets
And you're all out of words for the things you believe
As the daylight fades just turn your eyes towards me

Some may leave and some may lie
Some they kneel and some they fly
Some they lead and some they fall behind

[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
With nothing left to lose[/tab]
Nothing left to lose

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Don't make me wait[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
Make me wait[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
Make me wait without you[/tab]

Don't make me wait
Make me wait
Make me wait without you

With nothing left to lose
Nothing left to lose

Don't make me wait
Make me wait
Make me wait without you

Don't make me wait
Make me wait
Make me wait without you

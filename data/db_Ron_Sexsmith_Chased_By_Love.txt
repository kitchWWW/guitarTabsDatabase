[tab]Intro: [ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Verse 1:[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Well the sun came shining[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
Through my cell[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Am7[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
A book lies open upon my shelf[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
But I'm afraid I've lost the thread[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Am7[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch] C/[ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Can't seem to raise myself from bed today[/tab]

This whirlwind prisoner
I've locked away
Is blowing crazy around his cage
If I surrender to his cries
Would you pretend you don't recognize me?

Chorus:
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
From way back when[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
I'm the same boy that you knew then[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch] 
I just want to be chased by love[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am7[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch] 
Embraced by love[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cm[/ch]
Just like you[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
Just like you[/tab]

Verse 2: (same as verse 1)
I feel these chains of freedom
Chains of trust
Chains of mystery surrounding us
But I know you and you know me
You're not mistaken
I'm the one you think you see

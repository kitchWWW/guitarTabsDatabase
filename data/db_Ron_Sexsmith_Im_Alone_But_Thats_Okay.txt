When I found you I found myself [/tab]
G                           A﻿                        
I was gonna love you like nobody else
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch] 
But I never really had a clue[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
How to love a girl like you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]        
Two true believers we devise [/tab]
G              A﻿                 
A temporary paradise 
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Now our future's in the past [/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
I should've known it wouldn't last[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch] 
I should have been the better man[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch] 
You could have been a better friend [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch] 
I'm alone but that's okay [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
Guess the dice just rolled that way[/tab]

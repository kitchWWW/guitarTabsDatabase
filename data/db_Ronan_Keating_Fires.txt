Just stay on that road in that heartbeat
You're not alone in the dark, can you see me
Cause I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'm there in the light when you need me, to find your way home[/tab]

VERSE:
I'll never leave, you know I won't
I feel you're close, you're coming back to me
And summer may be over
But she leaves you her song
Hold on
Don't let go

CHORUS:
Just stay on that road in that heartbeat
You're not alone in the dark, can you see me
Cause I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'm there in the light when you need me, to find your way home

CHORUS:
Cause I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'll be lighting fires
Oh whoa

CHORUS:
Just stay on that road in that heartbeat
You're not alone in the dark, can you see me

CHORUS:
Cause I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'm there in the light when you need me, to find your way home

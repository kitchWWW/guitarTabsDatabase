Oh...[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F#[/ch]
There's a place I know that's tucked away,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]B[/ch]
A place where you and I can stay,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C#[/ch]
Where we can go to laugh and play,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#[/ch]
and have adventures every day![/tab]

[tab]  [ch]B[/ch]                                  [ch]F#[/ch]                 [ch]D#[/ch]
I know it sounds hard to believe, but guys and gals it's true![/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G#[/ch]              [ch]C#[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]
Camp Campbell is the place for me and you![/tab]


[tab]      [ch]Ab[/ch]
We'll swim through lakes and climb up trees,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Db[/ch]
catch fish, bugs, bears, and honeybees![/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb[/ch]
There's endless possibilities,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Ab[/ch]
and no, that's not hyperbole![/tab]

[tab]    [ch]Ab[/ch]                          [ch]Db[/ch]                [ch]Dbm[/ch]
Our motto's Campe Diem and that means I'm telling you...[/tab]

(n.c.)
We've got:

[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
archery, hiking, search and rescue biking,[/tab]
horseback, training that'll save you from a heart attack,
scuba diving, miming, keeping up with rhyming,
football, limbo, science, stunting,
pre-calc, spaceships, treasure hunting,
bomb defusal, no refusal,
fantasies, circus trapeze,
and fights and ghosts and paints and snakes,
and knives and chess and dance and weights,
[tab]     [ch]Ab[/ch]
it's Camp Camp![/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Another grey night[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
Blue lake soaks my pillowcase[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]
I wait, I wait[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#[/ch]
But you never get back to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
I'm dancing in my head[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
But I know the answer is no[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
‘Cause you don't, you don't[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F#[/ch]
Know how it feels to fall in love[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
And I couldn't look you in the eyes[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#[/ch]                               [ch]G#m[/ch]
‘Cause I knew I'd fall a thousand flights again[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]E[/ch]
And I ran ‘cause I knew that I'd lose who I am[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
And I know how far I thought I'd come[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F#[/ch]                                       [ch]G#m[/ch]
But with one beat of the drum, my heart's going wild again[/tab]

I close my eyes and I swear
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]
But I can't help[/tab]

I can't help but stare.

[Verse]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Oh I just did what I do[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
And got too attached to you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]
Now you're falling in love with someone that's not me[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F#[/ch]
Oh give me a moment to breathe[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
And I couldn't look you in the eyes[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F#[/ch]                             [ch]G#m[/ch]
‘Cause I knew I'd fall a thousand flights again[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]E[/ch]
And I ran ‘cause I knew that I'd lose who I am[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
And I know how far I thought I'd come[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F#[/ch]
But with one beat of the drum, my heart's going wild again[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
I close my eyes and I swear[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]
But I can't help[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]B[/ch]
I can't help but stare.[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F#[/ch]
I can't help but stare.[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G#m[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
I can't help i can't help but stare[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]     [ch]G#m[/ch]
Come back, no don't come back[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D#m[/ch]                         [ch]C#m[/ch]
I'm happy on my own without you lighting up my phone[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#[/ch]
But you still feel like home to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]                            [ch]D#m[/ch]
Every day's another fight when I can't get you off my mind[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m[/ch]                  [ch]F#[/ch]
I don't wanna look anymore.[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Another grey night[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]
Blue lake soaks my pillowcase[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I wait, I wait[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#[/ch]
But you never get back to me[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
And I couldn't look you in the eyes[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#[/ch]                                 [ch]G#m[/ch]
‘Cause I knew I'd fall a thousand flights again[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]E[/ch]
And I ran ‘cause I knew that I'd lose who I am[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
And I know how far I thought I'd come[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F#[/ch]                                        [ch]G#m[/ch]
But with one beat of the drum, my heart's going wild again[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]E[/ch]
I close my eyes and I swear[/tab]

[Outro]

I can't help but stare.

Verse 1:
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
Can you tell me something true?[/tab]

Tell me stories about people who could have been us[/tab]

Tales with happy endings where the ending's not the point[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]

[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
This is not a love song, or a tale of broken hearts,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]F[/ch]

But this is not a love song, it's just how things have to be[/tab]

[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]

Tell me what you had for breakfast, or something like that[/tab]

Can't we just go back to the way it was before[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
When I hadn't been so stupid to read in to something more[/tab]

And it's a good thing I was never one for fairy tales[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                               [ch]D[/ch]
I've made a small fortune and you squandered it all.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]

[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]

and Greyhound you're gone.[/tab]

That load on my mind got lighter, when you got on.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]Bm[/ch]

Thank God and Greyhound you're gone.[/tab]

INTRO:
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
(Seen through the eyes of a fool.)[/tab]

#1.
[tab][ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
If I see someone hold her tight, that's all right, [/tab]

they're just dancing.
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
If they're together in the moonlight, they're just [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
talking, not romancing.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                        [ch]A[/ch]
If I see her out with someone, it's just some old [/tab]

friend from school.

CHORUS:
[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Am7[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Am7[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
That's how it looks through the eyes of a fool.[/tab]

#2.
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                 [ch]D[/ch]
If her phone rings and she whispers, I can't talk now.. [/tab]

I don't care.
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]Am7[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
A personal matter and she'd rather not discuss it with [/tab]

me there.
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                         [ch]A[/ch]
If I see her smile at someone, that's not breaking any [/tab]

rule.

CHORUS:
[tab][ch]Dbm[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
That's how it looks through the eyes of a fool.[/tab]

BRIDGE:
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
They say that seeing is believing, believe me it's [/tab]

not true.
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
You can teach your eyes to only see the things you want [/tab]

them to.
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
So, I'd rather keep pretending, like a little child in [/tab]

school.
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
And I'll keep looking through the eyes of a fool.[/tab]

OUTRO:
[tab][ch]Em7[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Yes, I'll keep looking through the eyes of a fool.[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Honey please take time and charge your phone[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
 Make sure you're being productive when you're on your own[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
And think one step ahead, get to work, tie your shoes[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
And don't be late, don't forget to be proud of what you create[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
But oh baby please I've been craving it lately[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Oh the memories have got me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
Jonesing like crazy, crazy[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Cause it gets difficult, difficult[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
We all know it gets difficult being an adult[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
But follow mе, let's start a cult do some drugs[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Runaway from your typical difficulties[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Mi amor, whеn you leave make sure you close the door[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
 It's unlocked if you ever find yourself wanting more[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
I thought one step ahead, tied my shoes, went to work[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
And still was late, man I think I've got too much on my plate[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Cause it gets difficult, difficult[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
We all know it gets difficult being an adult[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
But follow mе, let's start a cult do some drugs[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Runaway from your typical difficulties[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]

[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
We all know it gets difficult being an adult[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
But follow mе, let's start a cult do some drugs[/tab]

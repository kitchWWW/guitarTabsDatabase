First tab. LOVE THIS SONG 

[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I left my heart on the top of a window sill[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch] 
It fell apart when the winds pulled it down [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
On the ground where the sun drove the colors deep [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
In the summer heat, the colors seem to drown [/tab]

[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
But you pulled up the colors with a simple tune [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
You breathed a song and you dusted off the sand [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
You put the pieces on your sleeve, you gave my heart to me [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
It looked so pretty that I fell upon my knees [/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
It looked so pretty that I fell upon my knees [/tab]

[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
And from the ground I saw your face [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
You spoke of love and you sang of grace [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]F#[/ch]
But come the night when the light is gone [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Its in the dark that my deeds are done [/tab]

[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
What I've done in darkness, I must turn away [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
This mended heart was meant for so much more [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Though the wind is telling me that it's ok [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
I'll stand my ground till I hear the kingdom come [/tab]

[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
So I will fight to keep the fire burning in the night [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
For I found words to keep me still [/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]F#[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
And though I'm prone to go and make the same mistakes [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
I hear your voice calling out my name [/tab]

[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
And from the ground I saw your face [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
You spoke of love and you sang of grace [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]F#[/ch]
But come the night when the light is gone [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Its in the dark that my deeds are done [/tab]

[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
And from the ground I saw your face [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
You spoke of love and you sang of grace [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]F#[/ch]
But come the night when the light is gone [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Its in the dark that my deeds are done [/tab]


[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
I'll fight to keep the fire burning in the night[/tab]

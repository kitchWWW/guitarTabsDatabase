Verse 1
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
This place is broken, So far from where it began[/tab]
Nothing like Heaven, Right now I don't understand

How You are working, I know I'll see in the end
For now I'm trusting, Only as much as I can
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
My heart is screaming out[/tab]


Chorus
[tab][ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
Your will be done[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]
Your kingdom come[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
My hope is in You[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Lord, don't delay[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]
Come have Your way[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
My hope is in You[/tab]


Verse 2
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Your thoughts are higher, Than the heavens above[/tab]
You hold the power, But You don't hold back Your love

From where I'm standing, I only see it in part
Just how You're moving, Help me believe that You are
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
My heart is screaming out[/tab]

[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
And all will be made new [/tab]

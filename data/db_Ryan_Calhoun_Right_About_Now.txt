There is no tab anywhere for this song so I thougth I'd figure out the tab for 
everyone. It's a great song to play. This is the best I could do.=)

Tuning: Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Bb, eb. 
 

Its in 3 so you can probably figure out the strumming pattern. 
 


Intro/verses:

[ch]Asus[/ch]/[ch]C#[/ch], [ch]Asus[/ch]/[ch]B[/ch], [ch]Asus[/ch]


Chorus:

[ch]E[/ch], [ch]Bm[/ch], [ch]C#m[/ch], [ch]Asus[/ch] 




Thats pretty much it. Just figure out the pattern and you'll get it.

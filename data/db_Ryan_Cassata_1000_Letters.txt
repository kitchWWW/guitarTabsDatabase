There's always calm before the storm 
Riding in the back with no seat belts on 
Falling in love at the break of dawn 
DAncing in the kitchen keep it turned on 
two more days until I'm gone 
The wings gonna take me, but not for long 
There's always calm before the storm 

Riding in the back with no seat belts on
take our dreams and please hold on 
when I come back well turn them on again 
Riding on the plane, I'll go so far 
Still were under the same old stars 
Don't worry I will light you up again

1,000 letters being sent your way 
1,000 kisses and words from me today 
1,000 letters, 1,000 letters
yeah they're on the way 

you tell my mom and tell my pa 
I won't be home 'til after dark
I'll take the last flight to the coast
I'm sure the mountains would miss me most 
I've changed my mind I'm not going home 
Leave the lights on I'll be back at ten
When I get there I'll be on my knees
Begging you to marry me 
I swear I'll never leave you again 

1,000 letters being sent your way 
1,000 kisses and words from me today 
1,000 letters, 1,000 letters
yeah I'm on the way! 

You can tell my Ma and tell my pa 
we got a house on the hill and a nice big car 
Livings good and lovings great
There never will be another lonely night 
were living fine and we've spent a dime 
to fix the place up nice for us to stay 
Don't worry Mom I'll visit soon 
Remember were under the same old moon 
For now All I can send to you is this 

1,000 letters being sent your way  1,000 kisses and words from me today 
1,000 letters, 1,000 letters
oh mom I'm doing fine  oh mom were doing fine

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                      [ch]C#m[/ch]
Laying down staring up at the moonlight, reminiscing on a new life, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]C#m[/ch]
And I ain't even sure what love feels like but tonight it just feels right[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]C#m[/ch] 
The chase I'm running in wont ever let me catch a break[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]C#m[/ch]
It's either run after my dreams or I get run down by my fate, I'll drink to that[/tab]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Nowadays everything is feeling temporary[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
People put their money first and happiness is secondary[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Binging on that lavish life and shit thats so unneccessary[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
Thinking they'll be happy when they laying in that cemetary[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Damn, well I'm here to lay that shit to rest[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#[/ch]
All that money, all that living it could make you second guess[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
If you didn't dedicate your life to something you obsess with[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]
But instead you put it to the side to get rich and depressed[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
The money's great it really is, if I could have it I would take it[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C#m[/ch]
But you're missing the important part, these dreams could reawake[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
And it's not about how long you live, nobody cares about your age[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
It's about how well you did, what you did and what you gave[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
And honestly I thought that hatin' was below me[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C#m[/ch]
'Til I heard that my own friends were claiming that they didnt know me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                
But I ain't have no heart to break, I'm trying to live a dream away[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C#m[/ch]
So I just keep up with the pace cause all I have left is the chase[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                      [ch]C#m[/ch]
Laying down staring up at the moonlight, reminiscing on a new life, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]C#m[/ch]
And I ain't even sure what love feels like but tonight it just feels right[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]C#m[/ch] 
The chase I'm running in wont ever let me catch a break[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]C#m[/ch]
It's either run after my dreams or I get run down by my fate, I'll drink to that[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Oh fuck it man, I'm out here losing my mind[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C#m[/ch]
I'm losing sleep on myself when I'm out here on the grind[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
It's hard to stay in the present with all that shit that's behind[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C#m[/ch]
It's hard to look to the future when it'll always be blind[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
I'll never know where I'll be, I could be dead in a day[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#m[/ch]
I could be rich in a week, I could be married in may[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
I could be dead and deceased or living life with a bae[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C#m[/ch]
I could be running on e, praying to god to escape[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
I swear to god I'm terrified everyday that I wake[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]
That I'mma look into the mirror, recognize a different face[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
Realizing that I lost myself out there during the race[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C#m[/ch]
Or mortified to see that I ended up losing the race to fate[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                                     [ch]C#m[/ch]
Yeah, and all these people need to learn what they're capable of doing and to know what they are worth[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
What they all should be pursuing and to know what they deserve[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C#m[/ch]
Life aint always easy cruising, it'll put you in reverse[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
And when you're laying in that death bed looking back[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C#m[/ch]
I can promise you the last thing on your mind is going to be cash[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
For everyone in a million never forget that there's a one[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
You gotta learn to get it done drop it all and start to run, for real[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                      [ch]C#m[/ch]
Laying down staring up at the moonlight, reminiscing on a new life, yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]C#m[/ch]
And I ain't even sure what love feels like but tonight it just feels right[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]C#m[/ch] 
The chase I'm running in wont ever let me catch a break[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]C#m[/ch]
It's either run after my dreams or I get run down by my fate, I'll drink to that[/tab]

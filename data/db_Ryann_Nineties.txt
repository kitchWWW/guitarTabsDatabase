[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
If this was still the '90s[/tab]
I'd be out in minutes
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
I'd just have to wonder[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
If you even existed, ooh[/tab]
What would I do?

[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
Have to get a rental car and drive to Arizona[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
I know I would never,[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
but if I really showed up, ooh[/tab]
What would you do?

What would you do? No

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
I'm feeling sentimental for things I never had[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
This book I read said[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
"Listen to your breath and be here right now"[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
Be here right now[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But how could I?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
You've got me outside of my body[/tab]
And I don't know where it is
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Feels like I'm going missin'[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Just floatin' down the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
Lost inside a daydream[/tab]

[Post-Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
This is fucked and we know it[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Maybe we should put it aside[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
But for now, let's keep goin'[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
Just floatin' down the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Lost inside a daydream[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Can you call me later?[/tab]
I've got nothin' to say
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
I just wanted to see you, baby, is that alright?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Ooh, what would you do[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
If I said I was fallin' in love?[/tab]
Maybe I'd be lyin'
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
Is this what it feels like[/tab]
Feelin' like you're dyin'?
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Ooh, nothin' to do[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
There's nothin' to do, no[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
We don't know where we're goin'[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
No, there's not a lighthouse[/tab]
Just our friends tryna be profound
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Sayin', "Be here right now"[/tab]
Be here right now

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But how could I?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
You've got me outside of my body[/tab]
And I don't know where it is
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Feels like I'm going missin'[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Just floatin' down the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
Lost inside a daydream[/tab]

[Post-Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
This is fucked and we know it[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Maybe we should put it aside[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
But for now, let's keep goin'[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
Just floatin' down the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Lost inside a daydream[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
If this was still the '90s[/tab]
I'd be out in minutes
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
I'd drive to Arizona[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
To find out what you're thinkin', ooh[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Ooh[/tab]

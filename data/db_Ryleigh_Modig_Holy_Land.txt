[Verse 1]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
I'm rolling up another cigarette[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
and it's four in the afternoon[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
I can't get you out of my head, and that's why she's in my bed[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
and I am pretending she's you[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
She used your old shampoo[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]D[/ch]
that's been sitting in one of my drawers[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And now she smells like you and I just don't know what to do[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
Cause my heart isn't her's it's yours[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
It feels like I have killed you and the blood is on my hands[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am7[/ch]                                            [ch]G[/ch]
Cause she's just an imposter sleeping in your holy land[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'm sitting on the edge of 21[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
and I've already had a few[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Cause I think about your hair while she wears my underwear[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe I need another drink or two[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
It feels like I have killed you and the blood is on my hands[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am7[/ch]                                            [ch]G[/ch]
Cause she's just an imposter sleeping in your holy land[/tab]

[Bridge]
[strum]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
I know you're not dead[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
But you still haunt me from the side of your bed[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
I know that it's not you and it's all in  my head[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
She's just an imposter in your holy land[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
It feels like I have killed you and the blood is on my hands[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am7[/ch]                                          [ch]G[/ch]
Cause she's just an imposter sleeping in your holy land[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
It feels like I have killed you and the blood is on my hands[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am7[/ch]                                          [ch]G[/ch]
Cause she's just an imposter sleeping in your holy land[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Sometimes it's wrong to walk away, though you think it's over[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
Knowing there's so much more to say[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
And suddenly the moment's gone[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
And all your dreams are upside down[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And you just want to change the way the world goes round, tell me[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Have you ever loved and lost somebody[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Wished there was a chance to say I'm sorry[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Can't you see, that's the way I feel about you and me, baby[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Have you ever felt your heart was breaking[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Looking down the road you should be taking[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
I should know, 'cause I loved and lost, the day I let you go[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Can't help but think that this is wrong[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
We should be together[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Back in your arms where I belong[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
And now I've finally realized[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
It was forever that I've found (forever that I've found)[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
I'd give it all to change the way the world goes round, tell me[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Have you ever loved and lost somebody[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Wished there was a chance to say I'm sorry[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Can't you see, that's the way I feel about you and me, baby[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Have you ever felt your heart was breaking[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Looking down the road you should be taking[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
I should know, 'cause I loved and lost, the day I let you go[/tab]

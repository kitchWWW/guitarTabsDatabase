[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]E5[/ch]
   That night on the car ride home,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]B/Eb[/ch]
I looked into your eyes and I could tell something was wrong.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#m7[/ch]
And now,      every time I get stopped at that light,[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I tear up cause it brings me back to that night.[/tab]

That night that you stopped loving me.

[tab]              [ch]E5[/ch]                                         [ch]B/Eb[/ch]
Your love was    so cold, fitting for the weather at the time.[/tab]

How stupid am I to try and reignite
[tab][ch]C#m7[/ch]
     Something that burned out so long ago?[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Asus2[/ch]
If there was something I could do to get you back, I’d do it tenfold.[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I just want you to love me the way that you used to.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C#m7[/ch]           [ch]Bsus4[/ch]            [ch]Asus2[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
The stories that we wrote down mean nothing to you anymore.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Asus2[/ch]                    [ch]C#m7[/ch]        [ch]Bsus4[/ch]      [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I hope you lie in your bed and you fall asleep lonely like I do.[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]E5[/ch]
   All my mistakes, and misunderstandings,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]B/Eb[/ch]
They show that I care, they show that I’m trying[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C#m7[/ch]
To figure you out and why you tore me down.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I’d cross an ocean for you but you’d rather see me drown.[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]E5[/ch]
And maybe this empty space is where I belong,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]B/Eb[/ch]
And I wish I could erase all the wrong lines that I’ve drawn.[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C#m7[/ch]
Cause now you’re messing with me, and you don’t give a fuck.[/tab]
      (mute)
So I’m done playing your games cause I’ve been your pawn for far too long.


[Chorus]

[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I just want you to love me the way that you used to.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C#m7[/ch]           [ch]Bsus4[/ch]            [ch]Asus2[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
The stories that we wrote down mean nothing to you anymore.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Asus2[/ch]                    [ch]C#m7[/ch]        [ch]Bsus4[/ch]      [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I hope you lie in your bed and you fall asleep lonely like I do.[/tab]


[Bridge]

[tab]  [ch]C#m7[/ch]  [ch]B/Eb[/ch]      [ch]E5[/ch]
Forever  in  my vision,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Asus2[/ch]
But always out of reach.[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C#m7[/ch]
If only you’d leave my mind,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]B/Eb[/ch]   [ch]E5[/ch]        [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I’d finally get some sleep.[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]Asus2[/ch]
'Cos I just want you to love me the way that you used to.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C#m7[/ch]           [ch]Bsus4[/ch]            [ch]Asus2[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
The stories that we wrote down mean nothing to you anymore.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Asus2[/ch]                    [ch]C#m7[/ch]        [ch]Bsus4[/ch]      [ch]Asus2[/ch]
I hope you lie in your bed and you fall asleep lonely like I do.[/tab]

Hey old friend, I came to see you today[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
I’m sorry I couldn’t be here when they laid you down[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
The way things are going at work I just couldn’t get away[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
I can’t believe the way this small town is growing everyday[/tab]

Remember that time your mamma caught us with those cigarettes [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
Every time your girlfriend called you got upset[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Did you ever marry, do you have any kids?[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
You talked about joinin the Army did you ever find the nerve?[/tab]
[tab]                                                [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
We were so hell bent on going to State, did you ever go that far[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
I took a job in the oil field by then, I needed the cash[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Remember that one time that guy punched me in the mouth[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
I never thought we’d make it out of there alive[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
It’s crazy, just the other day, I had you on my mind[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
I saw your folks in church last June, hadn’t seen them in years[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
They told me what your sister went through[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
I had to fight back the tears[/tab]

She was strong enough to deal with us two 
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
she could beat anything[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Remember that time the police chased us through downtown[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
Told me not to worry “I’ll lie for you” [/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]

I’ll try not to be a stranger when I come back to town[/tab]

I’ll set this bottle of Jim Beam by your headstone and flowers
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
I know the seal is broken but I couldn’t drink alone[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]

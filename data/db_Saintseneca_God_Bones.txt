As recorded by Saintseneca
(From the 2009 EP SAINTSENECA)


[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
Our dreams deflate to the tune of a hiss[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
They still buzz round your head like insects with a death wish[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
You were liquored up on whiskey and drunk on love[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
Hell was hot underneath and Heaven heavy above[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I couldn't tell you why I lie like I do[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Sometimes I'm not sure who I am[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
There is thunder in his eyes and lightning in his fists[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
And he's strangling me with the water tied around his wrists[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
And I am living and dying in a lie (and alive)[/tab]


[Interlude]
[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
If you find the bones of God would you show them to me?[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
Because if it isn't true then it ain't worth believing[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
You can throw me in the water and tell me to swim[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
But if God cries tears then drown me in them[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I couldn't tell you why I lie like I do[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Sometimes I'm not sure who I am[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
There is thunder in his eyes and lightning in his fists[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
And he's strangling me with the water tied around his wrists[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
And I am living and dying in a lie (and alive)[/tab]

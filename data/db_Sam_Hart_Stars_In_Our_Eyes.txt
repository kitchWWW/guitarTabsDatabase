[verse]

[ch]G[/ch]

was it ever gonna be easy

    [ch]D[/ch]

was it ever gonna make you

[ch]C[/ch]

fall into pieces

     [ch]D[/ch]

or hide away with the broken hearted

 

[ch]G[/ch]

cause i'm gonna take you farther

    [ch]D[/ch]

farther than you've ever seen

[ch]C[/ch]

out your window

    [ch]D[/ch]

to places shining brighter than the sun
 

[chorus]

[ch]C[/ch]

if they try to catch us

        [ch]D[/ch]

they will see how far we can fly

[ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]

Ooooooh.

[ch]C[/ch]

if they ever find us

[ch]D[/ch]

it'll be by the stars in our eyes

[ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]

stars

                        [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                

stars in our eyes

[verse]

[ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]

one day in the summer

        [ch]C[/ch]

i will come runnin just to find you

       [ch]D[/ch]

and take your hand so we can both be free


[ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]D[/ch]

free to breathe your own air

                   [ch]C[/ch]

free to hold on and on forever

         [ch]D[/ch]

while they say everything goes away
 
[chorus]

[ch]Dm[/ch]

one jump is all it takes 

              [ch]C[/ch]

to leave behind everything that you know

                    [ch]G[/ch]

but you can never look back

              [ch]D[/ch]

you can never go home


[chorus]

I thought I would just revise the version that was already posted... it just didnt sound
quite right. This version sounds a lot more like it. 	

Normal Tuning 
No Capo


Intro: D          G
        
  D                          G
We, we were always on the run
               D
From that old witch up the street
                      G
In the days when I was young

D                             G
Ride, ride our bikes on into town
           D                   
For some hockey cards
                             G
And whatever trouble may be found


A		G
I can never bring them back
	    D	      G 	   A		    Em A
But these days remain inside the very heart of me  
A		    G
My memories are white and black
D			   G   	 	  A            Em A
But the song's the same it plays in every part of me 

D                         G
Down, down was only a direction
       D                 G
and sad, sad was only on tv
  D                           G
And I, had faith and I had protection


(Chorus)

  A	       D
I still look back
    A	                      G                      A  
The summer sun shining, A light was always shining on me
	D     		A                          D
I was gone with the feel of her lips on my very first kiss
	 A           D	
And it seems so long
	  A                            G			 
Since I left it all behind in the back of my mind, 

in the back of my mind 


D                            G
Choking on cigarettes in the park
D                              G
Chasing my old dog around the yard
D                   
Hanging out on the street
        G
until dark and then its time to go home


(Chorus)

A                  G                   D               G
Snow was always falling down and the sound remains inside
           A          Em A
The very heart of me
A                   G
My mother waving from the porch
          D                 G              A       Em A
And the sight of it still plays in every part of me

(Bridge x2)

End on D

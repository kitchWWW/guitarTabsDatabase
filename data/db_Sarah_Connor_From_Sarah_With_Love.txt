For so many years we were friends  
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch] 
And yes I always knew what we could do  [/tab]
 
But so many tears in the rain  
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch] 
Felt the night you said  [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#[/ch]                    [ch]Bm[/ch] 
That love had come to you  [/tab]
 
I thought you were not my kind  
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch] 
I thought that I could never feel for you  [/tab]
 
 The passion and love you were feeling  
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch] 
And so you left  [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#[/ch] 
For someone new  [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch] 
  And now that you're far and away  [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
   I'm sending a letter today  [/tab]
 
[tab]                  [ch]Dm[/ch] 
From Sarah with love  [/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Bb[/ch] 
She'd got the lover she is dreaming of  [/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F/C[/ch]   
She never found the words to say but I know that today  [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]                  
She's gonna send her letter to you  [/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Dm[/ch] 
From Sarah with love  [/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Bb[/ch] 
She took your picture to the stars above  [/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Gm[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch] 
And they told her it is true  [/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]Dm/B[/ch] 
She could dare to fall in love with you  [/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch] 
So don't make her blue when she writes to you  [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]F#[/ch] 
From Sarah with love  [/tab]
  
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]     
  So maybe the chance for romance  [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch] 
Is like a train to catch before it's gone  [/tab]
 
And I'll keep on waiting and dreaming  
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F#[/ch]   
You're strong enough to understand  [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch] 
  As long as you're so far away  [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
   I'm sending a letter each day  [/tab]
 
[tab]                [ch]Dm[/ch] 
From Sarah with love  [/tab]

[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
He's the first taste of something you shouldn't have[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
He's the first lie you tell to your mom and dad[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
He's the reason you love the smell of polo and peppermint[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
He's the lips that taught you how to kiss[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
He's the reason you know how to drive a stick[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
He's the last time you ever felt innocent[/tab]

Chorus:
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
It's a scene from a Saturday matinee[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                                    [ch]F[/ch]
It's a song that remembers those summer days[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Even if that cowboy rides away real slow[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
The boy never stays[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
And the love never goes[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
He's the reason ferris wheels make you sad[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
He's a box full of taped-up photographs[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
He's the feeling that always feels like seventeen[/tab]

[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
He's a name that you hardly ever hear[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
He's a face that you haven't seen in years[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
That you meet up once in a while in your dreams[/tab]

Chorus

[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
You never fall quite the same again[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
After the first time[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
Forever ends[/tab]

Chorus

[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]
Oh the love never goes[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
He's the first taste of something you shouldn't have[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch] 
He's the first lie you tell to your mom and dad[/tab]

[ch]Am[/ch]

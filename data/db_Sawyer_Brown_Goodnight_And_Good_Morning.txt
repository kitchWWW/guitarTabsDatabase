[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Billy was known as a wild child[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
His hometown was Born to Be Mild[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Truth be told, Billy's alright[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
But one particular Friday night[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
He had a little date, stayed out late[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
Mama and Daddy sit with folded hands[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He comes in[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
It's where've you been[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E7[/ch]                                    [ch]A7[/ch]
And "What do you have to say for yourself, young man?"[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
He said, "Good night and good morning[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I've been tested but not arrested[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A7[/ch]
Wake me up about lunchtime."[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Neighbors stand out in the yard[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
You can hear opinions forming[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
He said, "Good night and good morning."[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
What goes around comes back again[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Billy got married and they had twins[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
They barely sleep when they sleep at all[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A7[/ch]
They tiptoe up and down the hall[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Pat a little cake, one's still awake[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
Mama and Daddy throwing up their hands[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Rocking that chair, going nowhere[/tab]
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]                       [ch]A7[/ch]
Talk about your ever-changing plans[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Well, they said, "Good night and good morning[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Stories' read, prayers are said[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]A7[/ch]
Wake me up about lunchtime[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Telephone's out in the yard[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
And the baby bottle warming."[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
They say, "Good night and good morning."[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
He worked graveyard shift at Walmart[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Greeting shoppers at the door[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Night court, truck stops, and diners[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
All the way to Baltimore[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
He finally found his calling on the late-night radio[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
He entertains insomniacs[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
On The Black Sheep Billy Show[/tab]


[Out-Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
He says, "Good night and good morning[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Caffeinated and highly rated[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Wake me up about drive time[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Out there on the Interstate, it's loud and it's informing."[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
He says, "Good night[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
Good night[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Good night and good morning."[/tab]

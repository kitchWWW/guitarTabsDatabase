[Verse 1]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]E[/ch]
Poor Pete is a bit self-conscious and he thinks that he's a vampire.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
He gets into his off-white Saturn and heads into the suburbs.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                                      [ch]E[/ch]
He looks at himself in the mirror, like a girl putting makeup on.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bm[/ch]                                               [ch]A[/ch]
He wants to buy a brand new pair of teeth, but they don't accept coupons.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]F#m[/ch]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
Is this gonna be the night that his daily horoscope comes true?[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]F#m[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
He knows Venus is in retrograde, but not if the moon is new.[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]
Poor Pete isn't fashion forward, but he likes to think he's ultra cool.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
He winks at a girl named Siouxsie while she's playing bumper pool.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]E[/ch]
She looks at him rather blankly, before mouthing the words, "yeah, right."[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                                       [ch]A[/ch]
She knows poor Pete's not the kind of guy who will ever get it right.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]F#m[/ch]                                     [ch]E[/ch]
So this isn't gonna be the night that his daily horoscope comes true.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]F#m[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
He knows Venus is in retrograde, but not if the moon is new.[/tab]

[Bridge]
[ch]A[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] x2

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]F#m[/ch]                                     [ch]E[/ch]
So this isn't gonna be the night that his daily horoscope comes true.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]F#m[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
He knows Venus is in retrograde, but not if the moon is new.[/tab]

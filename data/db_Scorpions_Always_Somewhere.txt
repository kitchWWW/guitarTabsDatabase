          Hi, guys this is my first tabbed song. I'm really happy I could do this since
I'm only 17. The reason I'm doing this is because some ass-hole has tabbed the solo of
this song and is claiming it to be perfect which it isn't. Secondly I've tabbed the song
in its entirety. So you don't have to look elsewhere for the chords, the lyrics, the
solos etc. (yeah! this means solos and chords included!) I expect you guys to give me
your full support and rate this song as soon as possible. So here we go now----
        
        This is the first part of the song, the rhythm part that is played by Rudolf
Schenker. Thanks to Jeff Roush (roush@stortek.com) for the first and second rhythm part.
We'll call the first part "A" and the second part "B" There are no double-digit nos. here.


[Part A]

                     E|------------3-----------------------|[/tab]


[Intro]

This part consists of the intro. Only this part is played in the intro, not the B part.

This is the Mathias Jabs part: -

     The last note on the B string at the 10th fret should be sustained.[/tab]


[Part B]
 
[tab]                    e|-------------3--3--0--0--0--0--0----|
                    B|-----1--1--0--3--3-----1--1--1--1---|
                    G|------0--0-----0--0-----2--2--2--2--|
                    D|-------2--2-------------------------|
                    A|--023---------------0---------------|
                    E|------------3-----------------------|[/tab]

This part of the rhythm comes only in the verses (except for once in the intro).
So this is how the rhythm goes: -
                        1) Part A twice without drums
                        2) Part A twice with drums
                        3) Part A once with solo 1
                        4) Part B once with end of solo followed by Klaus Meine singing

For the verses play part "A" first followed by part "B" repeat the pattern till the chorus

These are the lyrics of the song: -

                               Arrive at seven, the place feels good
                               No time to call you today.
                               Encores at eleven, then Chinese food,
                               Back to the hotel again.

Some of you'll might prefer sliding down the ---15p13-12-13p12-10part. It's a good idea,
but it won't sound perfect. That's why I prefer to pull-off. After this part comes the
second verse: -
                  I call your number; the line ain't free,
                  I'd like to tell you, come to me.
                  And life without you seems like a lost dream.
                  Love I can tell you how I feel.

Keep alternating with the rhythm part (Part A &amp; Part B)


[Chorus]

These are the power chords for the chorus. They're pretty good but I wonder if it'll
sound good on an acoustic guitar.

The lyrics of the chorus are: -
                                Always somewhere
                                Miss you where I've been.
                                I'll be back to love you again. (Repeat again)

Now comes the solo part. For this Rudolf Schenker keeps playing only the first rhythm
part (Part A) throughout the solo.
This is the Mathias Jabs part: -

This ends the main solo (whew!). This tab is more than accurate. The pull-off's slides
etc. are all perfect and will help you get the same sound. But you'll have to listen to
the song to get the timing right. Also please note that all numbers are double digit
except the open string, which is marked as "0". The last note (10 on the B string) has
to be sustained till the singing begins.


[Verse 3]

                       Another morning, another place
                       The only day off is far away.
                       But every city has seen me in the end
                       And brings me to you again.


[Chorus]
           
                      Always somewhere
                      Miss you where I've been.
                      I'll be back to love you again.
                      Always somewhere
                      Miss you where I've been.
                      I'll be back to love you again, Ooh ooh. 


[Solo]

Then comes the small solo part for the CODA (the ending or outro for the ignorant). For
this part Rudolf Schenker plays the A part twice. The solo that Mathias Jabs plays is
somewhat related to the first solo. There is some kind of distortion pedal used that
makes the guitar sound like electric sparks flying. So you can't hear the solo clearly.
But it's okay of you don't play it. You need to play the rhythm part with another
guitarist simultaneously and slow down in the end. But for all those perfectionists here it is

[tab]e|-0-0------0--0----||--3-----------------------------------------------------|
B|----3------3--2---||-5-3h5p3-3h5-5p3-5p3-5p3-1-3p1-3p1-3p1-0----------------|
G|---------3--2--0-2||----------------------------------------2---------------|
D|------------------||--------------------------------------------------------|
A|------------------||--------------------------------------------------------|
E|------------------||--------------------------------------------------------|[/tab]

To play this last part you'll have to refer to the song. I've left out the timing since
it's quite hard to put down. I've separated both the parts by double lines. The first
part is the A part of the rhythm and the second is the second time it is played. As I
said before I've left out the timing so don't think that the timing is perfect. If you
don't get the part then play the rhythm part with another guitarist with a bit of
distortion and end it slowly. The song ends on A minor.

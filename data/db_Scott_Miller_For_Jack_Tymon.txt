Standard Tuning

This tab sounds almost exactly right.  I looked forever for a tab, but had to try to tab 
myself.  It's plenty accurate when playing around with some friends.

And may your heart be so pure its one that God wants to know.[/tab]


May your schooling be good, and if its not
May the times be easy and you still smart.
May your friendships be so that they almost feel like home
And your heart be so pure its one that God wants to know.

And may you have the joy of passing something on
Like the laugh of your father or the courage of your mom.
But if that never happens and you end up alone
May your heart be so pure its one that God wants to know.

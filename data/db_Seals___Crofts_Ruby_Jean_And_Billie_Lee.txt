Seals And Crofts - Ruby Jean and Billie Lee
 
 
INTRO: [ch]D[/ch] 
 
Oh, Ruby Jean
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Last night I dreamed I was running[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Somewhere beyond the stars[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
I called out to you[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
And you answered softly[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G/B[/ch]   [ch]Gm/Bb[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
You are the children's eyes[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And I'm the days gone by[/tab]
 
 
 
Oh, Ruby Jean
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
It doesn't seem like a long, long time[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
Since we were born again[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
Into the dazzling light[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Uniting black and white[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G/B[/ch]   [ch]Gm/Bb[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
You are the rich brown earth[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I'm the flowers that grow[/tab]
 
 
CHORUS:
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
We'll have children (Lua), of the kingdom (Joshua)[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
They won't be torn by war[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
Nor will they kill or hate, or hesitate to love (Justice)[/tab]
 
 
 
Oh, Billie Lee
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
It's destiny that we meet again[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
Here on this earthly plain[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
I'll see all the worlds with you[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
But you'll have to help me through[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G/B[/ch]   [ch]Gm/Bb[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
You are the straight and narrow path[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And I'm the wayfarer[/tab]
 
 
 
Oh, Billie Lee
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
We shall be free in the years to come[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
To help build the promised land[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
We'll go where the day springs run[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
Forever and live as one[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G/B[/ch]      [ch]Gm/Bb[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
He is the object of our longing[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And we're his creation[/tab]
 
 
CHORUS:
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
We'll have children, of the kingdom[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
They won't be torn by war[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
Nor will they kill or hate, or hesitate to love[/tab]

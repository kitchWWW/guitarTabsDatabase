My father came here from his home in Ireland,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G7[/ch]
He was quiet but they said that he was wise.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]C7[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
He and Mother did their best, gave us a home and all the rest,[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D7[/ch]             [ch]G7[/ch]
But to talk to us he never had the time.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G7[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Sure, he'd say "Pass the butter." or, "Come here young man."[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G7[/ch]
Or, "Keep quiet." or, "No you can't have a dime."[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]C7[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Until the day when I was leavin' when Dad finally found a reason[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D7[/ch]            [ch]G7[/ch]
For sharing his philosophy of life...[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G7[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
He said: "A monkey fart should smell like a banana,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G7[/ch]
English farts should smell like cups of tea;[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]C7[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
The farting of a fairy should be very light and airy,[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D7[/ch]                   [ch]G7[/ch]
When a father farts I hope you'll think of me.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G7[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
An Irish fart should always lilt with laughter,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G7[/ch]
It should melt your heart and melt your shorts as well,[/tab]
         [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]C7[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]               
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
A lion's fart should roar with power, cuckoos should fart every hour,[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D7[/ch]             [ch]G7[/ch]
A nun's fart should have meaning but no smell;[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G7[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
A strong man's fart should sound out like a trumpet,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G7[/ch]
A pretty girl's should barely even squeak,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]C7[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
But the person you can trust is the one who'd rather bust[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D7[/ch]                            [ch]G7[/ch]
Than ever let one rip right on the street..."[/tab]


[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G7[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
Well, from my old man this really was an earful,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G7[/ch]
I tried to understand just what he meant;[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]C7[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
His words were primitive but strong so I wouldn't get them wrong,[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D7[/ch]           [ch]G7[/ch]
He was saying to be careful as I went.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G7[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
He was saying to be happy as I could be,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G7[/ch]
He was saying watch my step and as I pass,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]C7[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
To beware who I look up to, and whatever else I might do,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D7[/ch] (Hold)                                        [ch]G7[/ch]
Know that most of what you get from folks is just escaping gas...[/tab]

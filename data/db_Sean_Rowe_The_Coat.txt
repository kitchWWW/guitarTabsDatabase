Sean Rowe - The Coat
My first tab, I mostly upload this because, although the chords are easy, there are no lyrics for this song 
anywhere on the internet (believe it or not). Chords are fairly basic anyway. There's some general finger 
picking going on throughout the chords, but it's not that difficult to figure out.

Enjoy!

EDIT: I noticed that I flipped the tabs upside down, so I flipped them back. Nooby mistake.


Capo on first fret
Verse:  [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch] 
Chorus: [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch] 
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
The C is played 3 3 2 0 1 0[/tab]

There's also this rather handy fingerlift in the G that goes 3 0 0 0 0 3 into a hameron 3 2 0 0 0 1
Altogether, the riff looks roughly like this:

[tab]E|-----3-------------------0--|
B|-----0-------------------0--|
G|-----0-------------------0--|
D|-----0-------0-----------2--|
A|-----2--0h2-----2--------2--|
E|--3--3-------------3--0--0--| The base snares (E and B) are rather optional on the full chords.[/tab]

This repeats on the Em, then switches to the C, with the hameron on the index finger before the chords repeat:

[tab]E|-------------------3--|
B|--0h1--------------0--|
G|-------0-----------0--|
D|----------2--------0--|
A|-------------3-----2--|
E|----------------3--3--| It goes back into G.[/tab]

As for the lyrics...

Verse:
[tab][ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
I didn't have the heart to sell it[/tab]
So I just gave your coat away
I took it to the Salvation Army
Where holy goners go to pray

I gave you my last drop of feeling
I made myself a shepherd's pie
And I've been sleeping in my blue jeans
I comb my hair to the other side

Chorus:
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
I had a dream we were together[/tab]
My baby blue, your boy in black
When you see your mother in Chicago
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
Tell her I'm happy to give you back[/tab]

Verse:
I haven't smoked since I was fourteen years
I haven't lied since I was ten
But in my head I am a felon
I take a drag before I go to bed

I held your hand at the gravesite
Your beauty lost where your body lay
And the day I knew you would believe in me
I burned a tattoo on my leg

Chorus:
There's more air in Chicago
You can be on the other side
Because I'm not so good at failure
In case your mother asks you why

I had a dream we were together
My baby blue, your boy black
When you see your mother in Chicago
Tell her I'm happy to give you back
Tell her I'm happy to give you back


Love to all guitarist and singers out there! Cheers!

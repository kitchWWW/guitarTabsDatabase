i'm not attractive today
i'm not a sight for sore eyes
i'm not an Adam or Eve
i'm just a nervous young thing
hear my voice strain as i sing
my will won't bend and then break
the crate will break and i'll fall
i couldn't help it at all

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Em7[/ch]
i've got a license to confuse[/tab]
what do we get to lose?
a license to confuse

:Verse Riff:
i guess i got what it takes
to help me make this mistake
it took a while but i learned
it took a twist but i turned
and now it's clear that i'm blind
another mountain to climb
another distance to fall
i couldn't help it at all

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Em7[/ch]
i've got a license to confuse[/tab]
what have you got to lose?
a license to confuse

[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
i shouldn't sound so forlorn[/tab]
regret the day i was born
cos here i am and i have been
i only need a few friends

:Verse Riff:
my hands are sweating all day
like i've been letting me down
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
like i've been letting me slide[/tab]
just some nonsense on my mind
and a license to confuse
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]Bm[/ch]
nothing i can lose[/tab]

[ch]C#m[/ch]    [ch]Bm[/ch]     [ch]C#m[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
bust it build it for a need[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
here's my license that's my right[/tab]

Here are all the lyrics and the opening riff for Sebadoh's "Together or
Alone."  Hopefully someone else out there will get jacked enough to figure
out the rest (currently my ear is baffled).

Repeat a couple of times with slight variations


It was never my intention
To blindly feed the boy cocaine
I know romance isn't everything
But I'm obsessing just the same

Because today I don't feel worthy
You seem so beautiful and strong
These unsure hands could never soothe you
Too afraid of doing something wrong

And this confusion runs me down
Until I feel like another stranger
And could I help you grow
I guess we'll never know

Set up for the let down
These things happen all the time
I'm not longing to explore it again
I'm too scared of what you'll find

And this confusion runs me down
But I'll smile when I'm around you
Cause there's so much we could do
Together or alone, not afraid of being alone

Hope someone figures out the rest, there seems to be 4 different chord
progressions, but currently, they elude me.  N-joy.

Setup for the let down
But these things happen all the time
And I'm not longing to explore it again
I'm too scared of what you'll find

(Same as last chorus)

And this confusion wears me down
But I'll smile when I'm with you
Cause there's so much we could do
Together or alone
I'm not afraid of being alone

     Lou in my opinion writes the best pathetic love songs for people like me.
     I'll get out other Sebadoh songs as soon as I get motivated enough to do
     it.

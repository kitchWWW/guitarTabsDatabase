And then you came in
and you would say
we would sees the day.
And that all worries, all worries fade away.
And we would meet some guys
with the best hairstyles
we would have the time of our lives.

We were young
we were never apart,
true soulmatehearts.
We were having fun
But it was more than that,
you could read my mind.

I truly called ya
everyday for eight years.
And then I told ya
every little mental fear
And after that,
I died a bit.

'Cause those were the days
the joy of my life,
remember that, yeah.
And now we are older, yeah,
but I will never forget.

Those were the days
the joy of my life,
remember that.
And now we are older, yeah,
but I will never forget.
How could that do that (x3)

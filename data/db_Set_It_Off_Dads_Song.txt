[Verse 1]
(Riff)
Do you believe in happy endings?
(Riff)
Or the mendings of human hearts?
(Riff)
Oh I believe in both, I'm certain
(Riff)
Because these curtains are state of the art
(Riff)
If you'd occasionally happen to spy on me
(Riff)
You'd think I'm having one sided conversations
(Riff)
But I hear him talking back
(Riff)
You'd think I may even lack some sanity
(Riff)
But maybe I can't let go
(Riff)
And so I'll say

Sorry that this one came out so sad[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Every tear I had was shed for the man[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
That gave me a better sense of life and meaning[/tab]

To motivate, there's no short-cuts to success[/tab]

[Verse 2]
(Riff 2)
I see a cold seat on the couch where I remember
(Riff 2)
That just four years ago around December
(Riff 2)
You sat me down and held me next to you, so close
(Riff 2)
How I long for things to be restored
(Riff 2)
To back when times weren't quite this hard
(Riff 2)
In the car that song you sang to me
(Riff 2)
Never rang so loud before


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]F#m[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, what I'd give for just another hug from you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F#m[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]
You may be gone, but love will never die[/tab]

And so I'll say


[Chorus]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]F#m[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Tears can't run dry when I start to cry[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]F#m[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
When I hear people speak of how you'd be so proud of me[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]F#m[/ch]
And how I hope this song will reach your ears[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I battled all my darkest fears[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]F#m[/ch]
I once was blind, but now it's clear[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
Wherever I go I know that you'll be near[/tab]

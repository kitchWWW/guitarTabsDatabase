[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
When pretending lends a helping hand[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C/E[/ch]
We hold it close, so close, and never let it go[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
Then, the pen begins to write a story[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C/E[/ch]
With an end that bends right out of our control[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab] [ch]Fm[/ch]
How did we get so jaded? I don't know[/tab]

Was it the white lies feeding our egos?
[tab] [ch]C/E[/ch]
I never valuated minutes I burned through[/tab]

Is that just how it goes?
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
Seconds I wasted, I was fixated[/tab]

You're devastated, sorry to say
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I can't fix it, is this where I give in?[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]Fm[/ch]                  [ch]Db[/ch]     [ch]Eb[/ch]
I'm falling through the hourglass[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Cm[/ch]        [ch]Fm[/ch]              [ch]Db[/ch]      [ch]Eb[/ch]
And I don't think I'll ever make it back[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Cm[/ch]           [ch]Fm[/ch]               [ch]Db[/ch]
So I throw stones at walls I'll never climb[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Ab[/ch]           [ch]Eb/G[/ch]
Victim to the sands of time[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Db[/ch]                       [ch]Eb[/ch]
Falling through the hourglass[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Cm[/ch]
The hourglass[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
Time is strange, it's ever-flowing[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C/E[/ch]
Never going back, it moves, but only in one way[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Fm[/ch]
Turn the page, look back at what you wrote[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C/E[/ch]
Do you still feel the same?[/tab]

I'll bet your mind has changed


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
How did it get so scary? I don't know[/tab]

Was it the hard life starving our egos
[tab] [ch]C/E[/ch]
I never valued minutes I burned through[/tab]
 
Is that just how it goes?
[tab] [ch]Db[/ch]
Seconds I wasted, I was fixated[/tab]

You're devastated, sorry to say
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I can't fix it, is this where I give in?[/tab]

(Let's go!)

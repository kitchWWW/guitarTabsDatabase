[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
I've come out three times first as queer and then as trans[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Both times met with acceptance[/tab]
And metaphorical clapping of hands
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Third time was met with disbelief an awkwardness so chronic[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
They thought I must be joking when I said I'm an alcoholic[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
They said I was too young as if there's an age limit for addiction[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And they drink way more than me[/tab]
And there's absolutely nothing wrong with them
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I can't say that I agree[/tab]
When our friendship's based on getting drunk
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
And sober conversation's a ship of silence that can't be sunk[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
'Cuz I drink when I'm happy[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
And I drink when i'm sad[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
And I drink when life is going well[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And when it turns out bad[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I drink to remember[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
And I drink to forget[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
My mum said that if I carry on[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I'll probably end up dead[/tab]
[ch]Bm[/ch]

[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
I first realised there were problems when I woke in a strangers bed[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I didn't know where the fuck I was and I couldn't feel my head[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I lost most of my money and I lost most of my clothes[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
And with that I found my pants and took to the open road[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
I tried to call my friends but none of them picked up[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
They were probably still out clubbing[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Or probably just too drunk[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
So I called the one woman on whom I can rely[/tab]
'Hi mum it's me I'm lost' I said and then I began to cry

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]F#[/ch]           [ch]Bm[/ch]
Look around what can you see she asked and I could see Big Ben[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]F#[/ch]                    [ch]BM[/ch]
And I found a train station and promised this won't happen again[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
When I promised that I meant it my drinking career would end[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F#m[/ch]              [ch]F#[/ch]
But it didn't stop me doing the exact same thing[/tab]
That next weekend

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
'Cuz I drink when I'm happy[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And I drink when I'm sad[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
And I drink when life is going well[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
And when it turns out bad[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I drink to remember[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
And I drink to forget[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
My mum said that if I carry on[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
I'll probably end up dead[/tab]

[Vers 3]

[tab][ch]BM[/ch]
If you think it's not a problem then let me tell you this[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I promised my best friend I'd stopped drinking[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
That same night I got pissed[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
I missed her exhibition because I was so hungover[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
I doesn't take a genius to work out that friendship's over[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
When you wanna put down the bottle[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
But you've lost all the willpower[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
And you slip on the bathroom floor[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
And knock yourself out in the shower[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And you try to kill yourself[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
'Cuz you're convinced you won't be missed[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
The next morning you realise[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
You only felt that way 'cuz you were pissed[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
When you're abusive towards your friends[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
And abusive towards your partner[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
And you wake up with no recollection of that behaviour after[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
If you've still got the audacity to tell me I'm okay[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Then my friend stay the fuck outta my life[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]F#[/ch]
And stay the fuck outta my way[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
'Cuz I drink when I'm happy[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And I drink when I'm sad[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
And I drink when life is going well[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
And when it turns out bad[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I drink to remember[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
And I drink to forget[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
My mum said that if I carry on[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
I'll probably end up dead[/tab]

**I couldn't find any good versions of this song on the net; the tabs I found were 
in the wrong key.  
[tab]This should carry you through pretty good.  The ([ch]G#m[/ch]  [ch]F#[/ch]) at the end of each verse 
are denoting that [/tab]
is played only the second time while leading into the chorus.  Enjoy!

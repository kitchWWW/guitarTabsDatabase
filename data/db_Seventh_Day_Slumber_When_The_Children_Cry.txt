I-
[tab][ch]G9[/ch]      [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Little child[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Dry your crying eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]C9[/ch]         [ch]G/B[/ch]
How can I explain[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am9[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
The fear you feel inside[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D/F#[/ch]
Cause you were born[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Into this evil world[/tab]
[tab][ch]C9[/ch]            [ch]G/B[/ch]
Where man is killing man[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am9[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And no one knows just why[/tab]

(Chorus)
[tab][ch]C9[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
What have we become[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em9[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]      
Just look what we have done[/tab]
[tab][ch]C9[/ch]      [ch]G/B[/ch]
All that we've destroyed[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am9[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch] (sus)
You must build again[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em9[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
When the children cry[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G9[/ch]
Let 'em know we tried[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Cause when the children sing[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C9[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Then the new world begins[/tab]

(repeat intro)

II-
(Do verse 1 Chords)
Little child
You must show the way
To a better day
For all the young
Cause you were born
For the all the world to see
That we all can live
With love and peace

III-
(do chorus chords pattern)

No more presidents
And all the wars will end
One united world under God
When the children cry
Let 'em know we tried
Cause when the children sing
Then the new world begins

What have we become
Just look what we have done
All that we've destroyed
You must build again

No more presidents
And all the wars will end
One united world under God

When the children cry
Let 'em know we tried
And when the children fight
Let 'em know it ain't right
When the children pray
Let 'em know the way
Cause when the children sing
The new world begins..

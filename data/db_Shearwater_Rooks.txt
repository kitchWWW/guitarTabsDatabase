when the rooks were laid in piles by the sides of the road
[tab]         [ch]Emin[/ch]
crashing into the aerials tangled in the laundry lines[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dmaj[/ch]                                             [ch]Emin[/ch]
and gathered in a field they were burned in a feathering pyre[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dmaj[/ch]                                                 [ch]Cmaj[/ch]
their cold black eyes[/tab]
                 [ch]Bmaj[/ch]


when the swallows fell from the eaves and the gulls from the spires
[tab]         [ch]Emin[/ch]    
the starlings in millions would feed on the ground where they lie[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dmaj[/ch]                                                      [ch]Emin[/ch]
and the ambulance men said "there's nowhere to flee for your life"[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dmaj[/ch]                                                     [ch]Cmaj[/ch]
so we stay inside[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bmaj[/ch]
and we'll sleep until the world of man is paralyzed[/tab]
          [ch]Amin[/ch]                     [ch]Bmaj[/ch]       [ch]Emin[/ch]

(Same chords as verse for trumpet solo)


Oh the falconer awakes to the sound of the bells
[tab]       [ch]Emin[/ch]                                [ch]Gmaj[/ch]
overhead and southbound[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Amin[/ch]
they're leaving his life[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Bmaj[/ch]
and each empty cage just rings[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Emin[/ch]
in his heart like a bell[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Gmaj[/ch]
underneath these cold stars[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Amin[/ch]
in their trembling light[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Bmaj[/ch]
and he cries "amen,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Cmaj[/ch]
let their kingdom come tonight,[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Bmaj[/ch]
let this dream be realized."[/tab]
                     [ch]Emin[/ch]

And end on Gmin

Genre: 
Key: 


Capo on 1st fret

[ch]F[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Bb[/ch]   quietly


[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]
When you fall at the rocks[/tab]

At the bend at the river
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
With the blood from your nose[/tab]

Running hard on your fingers
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
And through the rest of your life[/tab]


[ch]F[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Bb[/ch]


[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
The electric charge[/tab]

Of a change in the weather
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
You were touching my arm[/tab]

You were holding a feather
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]Bb[/ch]
And then I opened my eyes[/tab]


[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
As the World goes racing, suddenly changed[/tab]
[tab]                                                [ch]C[/ch]
As the shock of the axe, it leaves you trembling[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
Like a busting shell in the small of your back[/tab]
[tab]                                                    [ch]C[/ch]
Or a job that's hard on the cast of your little lie[/tab]

And an animal life was surging away


[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]
And you were back on the road[/tab]

Through the worst of the Winter
[tab]           [ch]Dm[/ch]
Through the Valley of Lies[/tab]

Passing through like an arrow


[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
Oh, if your vision collapsed[/tab]

And a storm from the river
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
Like a golden medalion[/tab]

Clutching tight in your fingers
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]
But on the slope of the edge[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bb[/ch]
Will you recover your life[/tab]


[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
You could stand on the back of a shuddering beam[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
With a pistol firing shots into the air[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
You could run in the blood of the Sun's hard rays[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]Dm[/ch]
You could drive the mountains down into the bay[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]Am[/ch]
Or go back to the East where it's all so civilized[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bb[/ch]
Where I was born to the life[/tab]


[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]
But I am leaving the life[/tab]

I am leaving the life

I am leaving the life

I am leaving the life
[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]
I am leaving the life[/tab]

I am leaving the life

I am leaving the life

I am leaving the life
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]Bb[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
I am leaving[/tab]

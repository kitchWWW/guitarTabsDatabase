Verse 2

When you called me baby
I'm needing you already
You don't even recognize you're gone
I hate this cloud I'm under
And I can't stand the thunder
I always prayed on the happiness you brought
Sands in hourglasses hit the ground
Millions of them, lost and never found

Chorus 2

If I were smart
I wouldn't have a heart
If I were smart
I wouldn't have a heart

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]E7sus4[/ch]  [ch]E7[/ch]
But his emptiness was real, he wanted more[/tab]
[tab][ch]C/G[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
But when his chest was pounding, he wished he'd never found it[/tab]



[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]E7sus4[/ch] [ch]E7[/ch]
Cause the hurt came hard and tears began to pour[/tab]

Oooooohhh

Chorus 4

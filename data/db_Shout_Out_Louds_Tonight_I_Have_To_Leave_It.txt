Don't come up to me and say you like it.[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
It's better if you say you hate it, that's the truth exactly.[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
When we go out dancing I don't want to be bothered,[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
I just want to be bothered with real love.[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]C#m[/ch]
So I heard it's no good to run,[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]C#m[/ch]
but it feels so much better now that it's done[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]B[/ch]
and tonight I have to leave it.   [/tab]

[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]      
So I've heard you know how to write it,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]                                    [ch]A[/ch]
does it mean you're good at putting things on paper?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Rumours say that you're very sorry.[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
Oh no you're not sorry, no you're not.[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]C#m[/ch]
So I heard it's no good to run,[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]C#m[/ch]
but it feels so much better now that it's done[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]   :|
and tonight I have to leave it. [/tab]

[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
Why don't you give love?[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
Why don't you give love?[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]E[/ch] 
Tonight I have to leave it.[/tab]

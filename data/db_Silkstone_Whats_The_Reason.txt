G               C            D
Hiding from the blue in your eyes
Bm\F#    Em            Am             C         D
I never told you that I don't need a reason to be in
G             C             D
Love with the smile on your face
B7           Em        Am
Guess I just want you around to keep
   C           D
my feet on the ground

    G                   D\F#
And I Say why can't you tell me
             C
What's the reason
          Am    D        G
Tell me what is on your mind
                D/F#
I try not to be uptight
                C
But I need to know now
          Am        D    G
Tell me what is on your mind

(Intro riff)

G               C            D
Is it something we've got to mend
   Bm\F#            Em    Am
Or should we do it over again
       C              D
Do you need some more time to
G            C         D
Learn how to love in return
B7          Em        Am
If only you gave me a sign
       C           D
Then I know i'd be fine

    G                    D\F#
And I Say why can't you tell me
            C
What's the reason
         Am     D        G
Tell me what is on your mind
               D/F#
I try not to be uptight
                    C
But I need to know now
          Am    D\F#     Em
Tell me what is on your mind

          Bm           G         C
Don't be afraid, it's never too late
                  Am      D/F# Em
But I don't wanna see you hesitate
                 Bm       G              C
It's a matter of time, before you'll be mine
               Am          D/F#       Em
But until that day I won't cross that line
       Dm         Dm\C     C          G      Am
Then life will be so much better for you and me
   B7
Just. let us be

[Intro [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] - pause]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]
When I was young my father would say[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Time bends its back for no one my son[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]                            [ch]Bb[/ch]
And bright skies they only fool a man who are blind[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
So look through the smile and see what's behind[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
Now that you left, all my dreams - drifted away[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
I try to move past but life's not the same[/tab]

[Pre-chorus]
[tab]     [ch]Bb[/ch]
If I only knew then[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
the things I know now[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
I'd take it all back[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]
and turn it around[/tab]

[chorus]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
Cause I have so much to say and more to give today[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bb[/ch]
this is no life to live (you gotta give)[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
Cause I have so much to say and more to give today[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bb[/ch]
this is no life to live (you gotta give)[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]Bb[/ch]
Must be a better way - a better way[/tab]
[[ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]]

[v2]
Now I sit here in a cage all my own
It's a new life, it's a brand new home
It's made out of steel, it's built out of fear
It's closed up to you and it's part of the deal

[Pre-chorus]

[chorus]

[Lead: [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] 4x]

[bridge]
Turn back the clock [Dm]
and put it all back [C]
I'll make the time last. [Bb]

[chorus 2x]

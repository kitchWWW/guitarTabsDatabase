when im crusing through, moving through
I can see that these children need new clothes and shoes
I can see that these children need education, Im not a fool
cause I've got the strength and I've got the vibes
I've got my children and my beautiful wife
life is for love life is for living
the bless from above is so much I keep giving
the creating of the earth,oh the earth let us enjoy it
praise selassie I and don't destroy it..whoa
Bbm  / /         G#  / / (CHORUS)

things are so kindly so tempting watch the words from your mouth
pocket is empty still jah can work something out
don't know where the next line coming still we got lyrics jumping out
the people I grew up with I keep falling out
say my prays because jah will provide us
system is so hard me nah commit no murder or suiside
dear as I am give thanks for my life jah gonna bless me is my god
ohhhh dont you deprive
you got to open up your eyes
jah jahs example should never you go despise

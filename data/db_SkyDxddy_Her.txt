[Intro]
[ch]Em[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I've been seeing stars[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Every time I get up it's been getting hard[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
To keep on playing dress up[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
I'm body positive[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Until it's mine[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Fighting for an hourglass[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
And running out time[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
Just an innocent compliment[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I bet they didn't mean it[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Even if they did[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I bet I still wouldn't believe it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Thought when I got older[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
That this feeling would be gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
But I'm losing touch all at once[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
With everything I once was[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
If I could go back in time[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
I would tell her she looks divine[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
And I would guide her 'til she changed her mind[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
And never questioned who she was[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]
And we'd go run outside[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
And play for hours in the sun[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
And I'd tell her all about the woman[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
That she will become[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
And I'd say you're so much more than just a body[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
That needs measuring[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
So instead of counting calories[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
You can count on me[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I think that I'm addicted to this sickness[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
And I'm slowly dying[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But I'm the only witness[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
And I'm losing more than just a gap between my thighs[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Fighting for an hourglass and fighting for my life[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
Just an innocent compliment[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I bet they didn't mean it[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Even if they did[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I bet I still wouldn't believe it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
Thought when I got older[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
That this feeling would be gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
But I'm losing touch all at once[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
With everything I once was[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I've been unlearning[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Unhurting[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Untelling myself I have to earn it[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Is it worth it?[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Is it worth it?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
It's not worth it[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]
I've been unlearning[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Unhurting[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Untelling myself I have to earn it[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Is it worth it?[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Is it worth it?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
It's not worth it[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
If I could go back in time[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]

And I would guide her 'til she changed her mind[/tab]

Intro: [ch]Cm[/ch]

Once I had a love and it was a gas 
Soon turned out had a heart of glass 
Seemed like the real thing, only to find 
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind 

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
Once I had a love and it was divine [/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]C[/ch]
Soon found out I was losing my mind[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]Am[/ch]
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind [/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Csus4[/ch]
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind [/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]
In between [/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]C[/ch]
What I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine [/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]F[/ch]
Love is so confusing there's no peace of mind [/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]G[/ch]
If I fear I'm losing you it's just no good[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Cm[/ch] 
You teasing like you do [/tab]

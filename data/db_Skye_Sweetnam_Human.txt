Intro: [ch]Bm[/ch]

[tab][[ch]Bm[/ch]]You know what Simon says
He tells you what to do[/tab]
What if he told you to
[tab]Take off all your [[ch]F#[/ch](244322)]clothes
And dance In your birthday suit[/tab]
[tab][[ch]Bm[/ch]]Sure it's the latest craze
We all get influenced[/tab]
The little secret
[tab]They don't want you to [[ch]F#[/ch]]know
No no[/tab]

We're only [Em]human
[tab][[ch]D[/ch](557775)]Separated by our [[ch]A[/ch]]thoughts
So hang on [Em]to them[/tab]
Or you'll [[D(557775)]]find you might get [[ch]A[/ch]]caught
[[ch]F#[/ch]]Caught up in the

[tab][[ch]Bm[/ch]]Hype Monkey see and monkey do
Mustn't get brainwashed[/tab]
By what's surrounding you
Didn't you [[ch]Em[/ch]]know that
[tab]Every little [[ch]Bm[/ch]]thing's contagious
Oh yes[/tab]
Every little thing's contagious

It's when you watch TV
In everything you see
The virus seeping though
And you start to want
What they
Tell you you should want
It's in the air you breath
It's hidden up their sleeves
They're even marketing
What i say right now
Watch out

We're only human...caught up in the
Hype...contagious

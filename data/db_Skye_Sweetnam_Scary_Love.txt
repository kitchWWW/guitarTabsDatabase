Verse(same as intro)
what is love my love
Tell me do you know?
To me its dirt and blood and seed
That's how my garden grows

What is this pain inside
my veins they turn to frost
Is there an operation, please
And how much does it cost

Scary love
It's scary love

(Intro)x2
What is love my love?
Tell me why it burns
Like rage and fire inside of me
Yet causes no concern

I'm quite used to it
The ashes on my hands
At least I've felt the pain of love
but no one understands

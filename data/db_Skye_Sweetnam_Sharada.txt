[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
  Once upon a time there was a girl [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
  You really wouldn't call her typical [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
  Had her own definition of cool [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
She lived in her own world [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
  She had her own style her own rules [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
  She played along like it was usual [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
  Nobody even really knew her name[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
Her life was one big game [/tab]
 
[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]         [ch]Am7[/ch]
She got her head in the clouds [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]    [ch]Am7[/ch]
Sharada, Sharada [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Dm7[/ch]         [ch]Am7[/ch]            
Don't know when she'll come down [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]    [ch]Am7[/ch]
Sharada, Sharada [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm7[/ch]    [ch]Am7[/ch]
She can't get to bed [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]    [ch]Am7[/ch]
Sharada, Sharada [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]
She's got this song stuck in her head [/tab]
 
-her head, her head, song stuck in her head- 
 
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
  Dreaming all day [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
That's all she did [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
  Ever since she was a little kid [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]  
  All the teacher's thought that she was slow [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
She was just dreaming about her show [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
  And when they told her she's delirious [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
  She didn't care [/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]
She's just oblivious [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
  She likes to make everyone curious [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
One day she's gonna be famous [/tab]
 
[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]Dm7[/ch]         [ch]Am7[/ch]
She got her head in the clouds [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]    [ch]Am7[/ch]
Sharada, Sharada [/tab]

[tab][[ch]C[/ch]]
You met her at a party on Saturday night[/tab]
She was drinking Advocaat
Her skin was smooth
And her jeans were tight
You didn't think she'd go that far
Ah well, she might have looked like a princess
[G]Why'd ya have to [F#]give her [G]your [C]add[E]ress
[D]'Cause you ain't safe when you get home
[E]She gonna [D]call ya on the tel[C]e[A]phone              x 2

[tab]G -7-6-4---7-6-4---7-6-4-----------|
D -------7-------7-------7-5-4-----|
A -----------------------------7-5-|[/tab]

Chorus:
[D[Hey boy, that's Balwyn callin'                x 3
[D]Get on the [C]phone, [D]'till ya been [F#]stall[D]in'        x 2

It's just too easy when ya got to her flat
And she kicked off her platform shoes
You played around like a cat and a rat
And now you got the Balwyn blues
Well, you thought that she'd be a one nighter
[G]But now she wants to [F#]squeeze [G]you [C]tight[E]er
[D]'Cause you ain't safe when you get home
She gonna call ya on the telephone              x 2

Chorus

She sure knows when she's got a good catch
And she just won't let go
She's been searchin' for the perfect match
Her ambition with your dough
A brick veneer prison is waiting for you
[G]You just [F#]smile while [G]she turns the [D]screw
You ain't safe when you get home
She gonna call ya on the telephone              x 2

Chorus

Hey boy that's Balwyn callin' (quiet)   x 4

Chorus

Get on the phone
And get out of Balwyn

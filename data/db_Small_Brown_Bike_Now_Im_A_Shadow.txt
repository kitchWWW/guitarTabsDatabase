the rest is up to you. If you don't have the Small Brown Bike/Casket Lottery
split yet, your an idiot. It's one of the best splits i've ever boughten. Just
pick the damn thing up. I figured i'd get atleast this much up so it gives you
all some ideas. I saw them play this live so i know atleast the 1st guitar part
is right. They fuckin' rock live! GO SEE THEM! I might do the rest someday, but
i'm tired.

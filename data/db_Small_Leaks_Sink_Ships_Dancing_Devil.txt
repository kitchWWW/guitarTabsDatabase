  [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]


[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He whispered in his ear[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
He told him what he wants to hear[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
But this poor boy, he may stay strong[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He had his own concerns[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
But he fell apart from words[/tab]

Yeah, God, those words
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
All those reckless words[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Here in the crops of the Garden of Eden[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
You're the fool, you're the fool[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Here in the crops of the Garden of Eden[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
You're the fool, you're the fool[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
You're the fool, you're the fool[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                               [ch]C[/ch]
I've been looking for you , but you've gone far away[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Now the light in my eyes starts to dissipate[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                            [ch]C[/ch]
When I knock on your gates, will you let me in?[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
I just want to stay, stay just for a bit[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                           [ch]C[/ch]
And bless your silly son for all his wicked ways[/tab]

He's got the world on a string
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
But his heart is out of place[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
I have watched men go back to their old ways, their old ways[/tab]

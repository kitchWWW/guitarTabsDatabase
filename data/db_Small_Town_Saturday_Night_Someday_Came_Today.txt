Hm-m-m-m-mmm
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Someday I will find[/tab]
My ticket outta here
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Wake up one mornin’[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
And just start packin’[/tab]
Yea-I’ll make up my mind
And I’ll lay down my fear
Stop waitin’ for the next bad thing to happen
I’m ready for the rainbow to begin
I just got through a storm of tears
[tab]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
I thought would never end[/tab]

CHORUS
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
Someday was a dream that always seemed to turn out wrong[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
But now it’s not so far away[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                        
Puttin’ off tomorrow[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]    
Is 24 hours too long[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
I guess my someday came today[/tab]

Maybe I’ll take a train
To a place I’ve never been
Or I could watch the sun fall into the ocean
I finally feel alive
Throw my heart into overdrive
Get up and get this life in motion
I’ll do everything I’m meant to do
Cause I’m past the pain and sorrow that kept it all from comin’ true

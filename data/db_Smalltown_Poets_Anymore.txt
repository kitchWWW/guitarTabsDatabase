                        Verse 1
[tab][ch]E5[/ch]
Cover it up with a question mark,[/tab]

Cover it with a crowd,
[tab]         [ch]G#5[/ch]      [ch]A5[/ch]       [ch]B5[/ch]
Keeping myself among the proud[/tab]

I don't believe anyone could love,

Anyone less if they tried.
[tab]            [ch]G#5[/ch]      [ch]A5[/ch]     [ch]B5[/ch]    [ch]A5[/ch]
I smiled at you and died inside, inside.[/tab]
(pre chorus)
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]
I heard the voice I knew,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                         [ch]B[/ch]
Covered it over with thoughts of you,[/tab]
(chorus)
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
Never keeping silent anymore, silent anymore, anymore.[/tab]

                  Verse 2
Silently think of a prayer for me,
Voice it inside your head.
Maybe I need to hear it said, it said.
Sometimes the word condemns the thought
So they are held a lot.
(pre chorus)
Whether it's God or it's you,
I need to speak and be spoken to,
(chorus)
Can't stand this silence anymore, silence anymore, anymore.

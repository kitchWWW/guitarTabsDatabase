[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
You didn't wanna know me[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
Said you didn't wanna know me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]
But you hide behind the lies[/tab]

You're in disguise, I can't describe
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
The feeling when I said to you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
Do you remember what I said to you?[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]Am[/ch]
You said you wanted to hang out for coffee[/tab]

But you didn't even reply

I'm not even worth it am I?


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
Deep down when no one's around[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
You've got a heart of gold[/tab]

Where is it now?
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
I don't have another way to get to you[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
Charlotte, I see a piece of you in all of my friends[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]F[/ch]
It's over now so why am I still thinking back[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
To all the times when all we did was laugh[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]
and cry for hours[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
You let me down[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
So Charlotte, would you still care[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
If you knew I was hurting?[/tab]

I miss my friend, it's like I'm missing
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]
Parts of me I didn't know[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
And now I've got to let them go[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
But I, I just wanna know if you're still fine[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
I kinda miss your family[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
Your dad was always there for me[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
He drove us anywhere we wanted[/tab]

Singing songs like karaoke
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
But that was six years ago[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
Where did all the time go?[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
I wonder if you've changed your hair[/tab]

Do you still live a stop from mine

Maybe it's a matter of time


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
'Cause deep down when no one's around[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
You've got a heart of gold[/tab]

Where is it now?
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
I don't have another way to get to you[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]

I just wanna know if you're still fine[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
'Cause if not, I'm there in a hurry[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
You moved on but you're part of my story[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
Everything is coming back to me now[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
Thought I'd be there when you marry[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
Does your therapist know about me?[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause mine does, mine does[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
If you knew I was hurting?[/tab]

I miss my friend, it's like I'm missing

Lyrics:
Pinch my arm to see if I'm awake or asleep
No there's nothing wrong
I'm just living through the hell of a bad week

I'm gonna go out drinking with my friends
To forget your sins
You might me innocent
But my head is filling in the blanks

Oh why are you wasting time on her?
Come waste your time with me instead
Why are you wasting time on her?
When you could waste your time with me
Come waste your time with me

You shouldn't have asked me
If you expected me to lie
But how can you ask me
To accept what makes me die inside

Oh why are you wasting time on her?
Come waste your time with me instead
Why are you wasting time on her?
When you could waste your time with me
Come waste your time

Oh why are you wasting time on ghosts?
Come waste your time with me instead
Why are your thoughts so far away?
When I am right here in your bed
You've got to kill those ghosts today
Why are you wasting time?
Why are you wasting time on ghosts?

Pinch my arm to see if I'm awake or asleep
No there's nothing wrong
I'm just living through the hell of a bad week

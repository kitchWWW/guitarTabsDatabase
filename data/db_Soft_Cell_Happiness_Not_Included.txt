[Intro]
[ch]A[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
[ch]A[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
We can't sanitize our history[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
Just because it's not what we want it to be[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
England was built on sorrow and pain[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Slavery and ill-gotten gain[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
We gotta look around and recognize[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Who we are now, how far we've come[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Recognize those who deserve it[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And live with those who don't[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
So wash your hands and sing happy birthday[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
Hand gel won't sanitize your sins[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
So much we enjoy are built on broken backs[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
We can't turn away and paper over the cracks[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
Before you get deluded[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
Read the small print of life[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Happiness not included[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Happiness not included[/tab]


[Interlude]
[ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 4]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
No one's gonna save us, I've come to set us free[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
When they're piling up their bodies and they're pointing at me[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
And you told me last night that I didn't have to fear[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
That if that is the case, just what the fuck we're doing here[/tab]


[Verse 5]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Staring at the dark, taking stock of our lives[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
Troopers stealing control, even sharpening our knives[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Getting up and ready when it all comes down[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
Get ready to duck so hit the ground[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Look around now[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Look around now[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Look around now[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Look around now[/tab]


[Verse 5]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Everything and it's seen as offensive[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
That's why we're always on the defensive[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
Our social media makes us slaves, like[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Children we have to be told to behave[/tab]


[Verse 6]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
We only see in black and white[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Retching up the drama for the thrill of the fight[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
And we kill, kill, kill in the rush of the game[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
Shooting all the soldiers again and again[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Before you get deluded[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
Read the small print of life (look around now)[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Happiness not included (look around now)[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Happiness not included (look around now)[/tab]


[Verse 7]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Times are moved in shifting sands[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
The future's in another lunatic's hands[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
It's turning on my TV again[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
They're watching all the people in pain[/tab]


[Verse 8]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
News is like crack cocaine[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]
Everybody getting high again and again[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I don't wanna know about the politician talks[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I don't even know just how the magic works[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Look around now[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Look around now[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Look around now[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Look around now[/tab]


[Verse 9]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
So put your grief in a tweet with the crying emoji[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]
And so many words with nothing to say[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And don't look at me you Hollywood whores[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
When you're back there sweeping the restaurant floors[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
Before you get deluded[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
Read the small print of life[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Happiness not included[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Happiness not included[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
Before you get deluded[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
Read the small print of life[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Happiness not included[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Happiness not included[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Look around[/tab]


[Outro]
[ch]A[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]E7[/ch]                                     [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
I really love your dark dark eyes especially with that charming smile of yours[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]E7[/ch]                                     [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
I really love that messy hair you get when you just roll out of my bed[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                    [ch]Em[/ch]
But there's one thing I haven't told you yet[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]                                      [ch]E7[/ch]
I'll love you even more when things are bad[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
You said I don't deserve to have someone like you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I'm only human and you're the moon[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]
I'll never know how to treat you right[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Sooner or later you'll leave my side[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]E7[/ch]
If I could go back in time[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]A7[/ch]
I would still say yes I do[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Cuz I would go through hell[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Just to be with you[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]E7[/ch]                         [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
I really hate it when you lie especially when you're seeing her again[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]E7[/ch]                            [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
I really hate it when you say you love me while you're laying next to her[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                    [ch]Em[/ch]
But there's one thing that will never change[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]                                      [ch]E7[/ch]
Is the love from me that you've been taking for granted[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
You said, "Baby I'll change, I'll come back to you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
This is just a phase all these girls and booze[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]
Please believe me when I say[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
My heart belongs to you."[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]E7[/ch]
If I could go back in time[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]A7[/ch]
I would still say yes I do[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Cuz I would go through hell[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Just to be with you[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]                           [ch]A7[/ch]                     [ch]Dm7[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
I know things aren't looking good but I'm not giving up on you on us on our love[/tab]
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]                                 [ch]A7[/ch]
Maybe you dont see it working out for us right now[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
But I'll show you how beautiful love can be[/tab]

I would still say yes I do[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]F#m7[/ch]
Last night I had a dream,[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]
You were whacked out on coke and speed,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m7[/ch]
The smoke had stained your teeth,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
You were so rushed you could hardly speak,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bm[/ch]
It made me so sad to see you,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Looking so old,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m7[/ch]                                     [ch]A[/ch]
Is this what happiness is like when it's taken its toll.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]           [ch]F#m7[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
But this is never the life I thought you aspired to believe,[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]            [ch]F#m7[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Oh, what has rock and roll, led you to believe,[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]       [ch]F#m7[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
This is never the life I thought you aspired to lead,[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]            [ch]F#m7[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]F#m7[/ch]
Oh, what has rock and roll, led you to believe.[/tab]


[Interlude]
[ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]Esus2[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]Esus2[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]
[ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]Esus2[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]Esus2[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]F#m7[/ch]
I saw you the other day,[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]Esus2[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]Esus2[/ch]
I just wanted to sit and talk a while,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#m7[/ch]                                                [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]Esus2[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]Esus2[/ch]
Oh, I missed you so much it's like I wanted life to be confirmed by your   smile,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]
And it made me so sad to see you,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Looking so old,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m7[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
Is this what happiness is like when it's taken its toll.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]           [ch]F#m7[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Oh, this is never the life I thought you aspired to believe,[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]            [ch]F#m7[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Oh, what has rock and roll, led you to believe,[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]       [ch]F#m7[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
This is never the life I thought you aspired to lead,[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]            [ch]F#m7[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]F#m7[/ch]
Oh, what has rock and roll, led you to believe.[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
Is this what happiness is like?[/tab]

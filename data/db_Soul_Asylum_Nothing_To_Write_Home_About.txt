[tab]       [ch]B[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Dear mother, what can I say?[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]
It's been so long since I went away[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]B[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
And, yes, I miss the comforts of home[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]
But I guess I'm better off on my own[/tab]


[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]B[/ch]
No one told me people could be so cruel[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                     [ch]B[/ch]
Nobody told me about any of this in school[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Still nobody understands[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
The things that I don't understand[/tab]


[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
I've nothing to write home about[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Nothing I have figured out[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Still I have the same old doubts[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Nothing to write home about[/tab]

Dear John, that ain't my name
I'm just hanging 'round to take the blame
I'm filled with guilt, I'm filled with shame
Too much or not enough, it's all the same

And no one wants to talk about the loss
No one wants to talk about the cost
And everyone just looks away
Just like any other day

I've nothing to write home about
Nothing I have figured out
Still I have the same old doubts
Nothing to write home about

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Who can teach me how to change my ways?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Who will come and save the day?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Who will tell me what to say[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
When there's nothing left to say?[/tab]

[ch]B[/ch]_[ch]A[/ch]_[ch]G[/ch]_[ch]A[/ch]_[ch]B[/ch]_[ch]G[/ch]_[ch]A[/ch]_[ch]B[/ch]

Nobody told me about any of this in school
No one told me I'd be taken for a fool
And everyone just looks away
And tries to make it through the day

I've nothing to write home about
Nothing I have figured out
Still I have the same old doubts
Nothing to write home about

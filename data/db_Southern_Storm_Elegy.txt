[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
Blink in your eye is shining now[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]
And your look is searching around[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]B[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
Like my own[/tab]

Your answer to my question's known
Cause your hope in me has long time gone
And I'm still just another abnormal form

Life is not dream at all
It is just a filthy war
It is just a pain of soul

So squeeze the beauties from the life
Cause life is just passing by
Another town in a cosmic tour

[tab][ch]D5[/ch]
Like a mother to a child[/tab]
[tab][ch]E5[/ch]   [ch]F5[/ch]  [ch]G5[/ch]      [ch]A5[/ch]
You gave me the strength and you know I'll die[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C5[/ch]                         [ch]B5[/ch]   [ch]A5[/ch]  [ch]A5[/ch] [ch]B5[/ch] [ch]C5[/ch] [ch]D5[/ch]
But I'm still just another abnormal form[/tab]

Why all the questions leave the trace
Cause in my head your answers are pain
In my heart your word is blade

VERSE 2
We hitched a ride that would turn out suiside
I had my 45 replica gun.
I didn't think we'd ever need it,
Didn't know he had a real on loaded.
You went in first, took the worst,
Couldn't hear me shouting you
To stop above the busy traffic passing by,
We promiced that together we would die.

[tab][ch]C7[/ch]
I went in next, took a bullet in the chest,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
so I hit him on the head with the only thing that was anywhere near me,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C7[/ch]
A tin of baked beans and a woman's weekly.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I got the cash, picked you up and made a dash, we didn't get too far.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C7[/ch]
We made it to the parking lot,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
40 cops in front of us, guess who got shot.[/tab]

VERSE 3
Lying there dying in each other's arms,
Oh you said to me,
"Don't worry about a thing my little sweetheart,
We're together, we shall never be apart."
You took a chance on a loser like me
And you never let me down.
And whether we're in heaven or hell
I know it's better now than in separate cells.

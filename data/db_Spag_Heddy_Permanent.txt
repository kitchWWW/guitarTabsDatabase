Artist: Spag Heddy
Song: Permanent
Genre: 
Key: 


not my favourite song, used to listen to it when i was 10 and was playing about with the guitar and found
this
 melody
this is only the lead at the start of the song after the piano chords come in,
almost definately also not in the right key, but i dont know what the key is and dont like the song enough to
find out :)
also the rhythm is messed but its my first tab i dont know how to do this shit x

First tab/chord sheet, corrections welcome.

* Album version key. Dylan plays this acoustically live in standard tuning but transposes down one half
steps which results in the key of C instead of the album Db

[Verse 1]

[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Well, we're gonna waste the days[/tab]

Getting outpriced of our apartments
[tab]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]
Hoping we don't go homeless[/tab]

We sure as shit ain't moving home
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
Watching television, we're stealing from our parents[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
So many opinions on how we live[/tab]
[tab]                                                 [ch]D[/ch]
But there's no option for even how to get out of bed[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And my bleak mind[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Says it's cheaper just to die[/tab]

The prick inside my head's
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Laid off and daring me to try[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
My bleak mind says this is all you got[/tab]

Hoping all this time, but all you'll find is
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
It gets harder, doesn't it?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
It gets harder, doesn't it?[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
I won't see the doctor[/tab]

Until I'm down on my knees
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
Blacking out in strip malls to avoid[/tab]

Taking care of what's in front of me So
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I'll live my life off points[/tab]

From credit card financing
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
You'll stay stuck losing your jobs[/tab]

Let's watch these options pile up
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Or let's ask for help[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And my bleak mind[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Says it's cheaper just to die[/tab]

The prick inside my head's
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Laid off and daring me to try[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
My bleak mind says this is all you got[/tab]

Hoping all this time, but all you'll find is
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
It gets harder, doesn't it?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
It gets harder, doesn't it?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
It gets harder, doesn't it?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
It gets harder, doesn't it?[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
We replaced my broken mattress[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
With another hand me down[/tab]

Talking nightly about nothing
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Feels like giving up somehow[/tab]

Haven't we faced enough
[tab]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
To know this is how it goes?[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
We're mediocre, we're losers forever[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
We're losers forever[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And my bleak mind[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Says it's cheaper just to die[/tab]

The prick inside my head's
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Laid off and daring me to try[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
My bleak mind says this is all you got[/tab]

Hoping all this time, but all you'll find is

It gets harder, doesn't it?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
It gets harder, doesn't it?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
It gets harder, doesn't it?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]
It gets harder, doesn't it?[/tab]

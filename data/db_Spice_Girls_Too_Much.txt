[VERSE]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]A7[/ch]
  Love is blind, as far as the eye can see[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dmaj7[/ch]                   [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
  Deep and meaningless, words to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]               [ch]A7[/ch]
  Easy lover, I need a friend[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dmaj7[/ch]              [ch]Dm[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]
  Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end.[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]E[/ch]
Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
But sometimes illusion aint no revolution[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
That aint no release for me.[/tab]

[CHORUS 1]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]A7[/ch]
Too much of something is bad enough[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]                         [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
But something's coming over me to make me wonder[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]A7[/ch]
Too much of nothing is just as tough[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]                           [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied.[/tab]

[VERSE]
[tab]                        [ch]A7[/ch]
  Unwrap yourself from around my finger[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dmaj7[/ch]                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
  Hold me too tight or left to linger[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                [ch]A7[/ch]
  Something fine built to last[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dmaj7[/ch]                           [ch]Dm[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
  Slipped up there I guess were running out of time too fast[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]E[/ch]
Yes my dear you know he soothes me (moves me)[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
There's no complication, there's no explanation[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
It's just a groove in me.[/tab]

[CHORUS 2]

What part of no dont you understand, (understand, understand)[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]A7[/ch]  [ch]Dmaj7[/ch]
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
Boy who thinks he can.[/tab]

[same as CHORUS 1]
Too much of something is bad enough,
But something coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied.

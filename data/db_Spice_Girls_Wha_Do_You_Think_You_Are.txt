The race is on to get out of the bottom , [/tab]

The top is high so your roots are forgotten 

Giving is good as long as you're getting, 

What's driving you it's ambition and betting, 

I said who do you think you are? 

Some kind of superstar, 

You have got to swing it, shake it, move it, make it, 

who do you think you are? 
[tab]( [ch]F#m[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch] ) 
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, [/tab]

show me how good you are, 

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, 

who do you think you are? 

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, 

show me how good you are. 
[tab]( [ch]F#m[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch] ) 
You're swelling out in the wrong direction, [/tab]

you've got the bug, superstar you've been bitten, 

Your trumpet's blowing for far too long, 

playing the snake of the ladder, but you're wrong. 
 
I said who do you think you are? 

Some kind of superstar, 

You have got to swing it, shake it, move it, make it, 

who do you think you are? 

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, 

show me how good you are, 

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, 

who do you think you are? 

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, 

show me how good you are.

You have got to reach up, never lose your soul, [/tab]

You have got to reach up, never lose control.

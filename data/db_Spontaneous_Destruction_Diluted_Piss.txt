Lyrics

I went to see the doctor today
He found that I like to drink my own urine all the time
He suggested that I reconsider what I'm drinking
Milk or coke would be fine

Chorus
But I don't know what to do
I can't stop drinking my own diluted piss

Oh so you actually dilute before you consume it
Well that's not as bad as I first thought
To tell you the truth I do the exact same thing
I know I shouldn't cos I'm a doctor but what the hell

Chorus

Slow bit
I got some bad news today
Doctor Woctor had passed away
He drank his own piss without diluting it first
He must have been lying... what a dick

Chorus

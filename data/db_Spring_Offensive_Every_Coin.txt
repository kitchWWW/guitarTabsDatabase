Intro: [ch]C#m[/ch]

[tab]  [ch]C#m[/ch]                                [ch]C#m/E[/ch]
Their orders fell from their mouths like spit[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m/B[/ch]                               [ch]C#m[/ch]
Circle like wolves but speaking like me.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                    [ch]C#m/E[/ch]
I hoped this was a case of collect and retreat,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m/B[/ch]                                            [ch]C#m[/ch]
But they took off my suit and tipped the coins from my wallet[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m[/ch]                                              [ch]C#m/E[/ch]
Well I swear I saw one smile as I found myself on my knees[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m/B[/ch]                                                  [ch]C#m[/ch]
He said I looked so tired and that I should stay there and eat[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m[/ch]                                                  [ch]C#m/E[/ch]
He said I should be grateful, that I should try to swallow hard[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m/B[/ch]                                         [ch]C#m[/ch]
I looked up from the floor and I said I just don’t know where to start[/tab]

[tab] [ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]F#m[/ch]
Please take a drink it seems to help[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m[/ch]
The hundreds I’ve seen coughing up on their wealth[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]                                   [ch]F#m[/ch]
Get the first one down and the others will follow[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m[/ch]
As long as it takes every coin must be swallowed[/tab]

[tab] [ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]F#m[/ch]

Get the first one down and the others will follow[/tab]
As long as it takes every coin must be swallowed
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]F#m[/ch]                        [ch]C#m[/ch]

I reached for pennies at first because they look so small[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m/B[/ch]
But their taste was so bitter I had to spit them out on the floor[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                              [ch]C#m/E[/ch]
I tried to force down a pound but I started to choke[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m/B[/ch]
You see the weight and the gold, it sticks in your throat[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                     [ch]C#m/E[/ch]
Well a hand on my back and a voice in my ear[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m/B[/ch]
Says credit cards are next so the work starts here[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                                   [ch]C#m/E[/ch]
Just open your mouth and push it down hard[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m/B[/ch]                                                    [ch]C#m[/ch]
Well I looked up from the floor I say there’s just too much I can’t.[/tab]

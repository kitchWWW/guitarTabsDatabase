This song is pretty damn cool.  I enjoy it very much.
It has a very weird guitar part, but the rest is just 
basic chords. The intro is also the outro, and is also
half of the chorus. You'll see what I mean...

It is standard tuning...

[ch]E[/ch]
[ch]A[/ch]

[ch]G[/ch]
[ch]B[/ch]
[ch]E[/ch]

The chords that are used are as follows...

                                          
[tab]    | [ch]E[/ch] | [ch]C[/ch] | [ch]D[/ch]  | [ch]E2[/ch] |                               
    |---|---|----|----|                                   
    |---|---|----|----|                                
    |-9-|---|----|-1--|                                      
    |-9-|10-|-12-|-2--|                                       
    |-7-|10-|-12-|-2--|                                     
    |-0-|-8-|-10-|-0--|            [/tab]

The chord (E) I will use as refernce throughout 
the tab as a certain riff.  And wherever you see
The (E) you play that riff.

The "E" riff...

This is the closest I can get it, and I don't think
it is 100% correct, I don't think it will ever be 
100% correct, unless the members of SW tell me what 
it is.  Use a wah pedal... (distortion)

--------9---------9-----------
--9-----9------9--9-9---------
--7-------7--7-7----7---------[/tab]
-0--0-0---0-0--0-0--0--------- That is the best I can
                               do. It sounds close enough
                               to me...
                               Thats not exactly the 
                               precise order. But enough
                               to get you started.

There is a little solo in this song.  I can't quite tell
if it's guitar or not, either way. I will figure it out.
But not right now, it will come soon once I have time, and 
can get intimate with the song.

Here's the lyrics and when to play and switch chords.  Everywhere I go I see your face

  And every sound I hear is the sound of your voice

  Why are you haunting me
 
  Why are you haunting me  (E) play both E's

  (intro riff)
 
  Everything about me is a lie

  At least it feels that way

  When I look in your eyes now...

  The truth scares the shit out of me

  Whoever said love is real and love is blood

  Has never felt the way that I feel

  What does it matter

  What's done is done and I should get on with me life

  Well I don't know what it means

  And I can't seem to make myself forget

  Was it something that you said

  Or is it all the guilt inside my head

A very simple song, not much guitar.  They use harmonics
and the rest revolves around an E.

I don't really know how to tab harmonics, but if you
place your finger right at the beginning of the fourth
fret you will get the correct harmonic.

Whenever you hear a guitar its playing an E, except at
the chorus..

Words...


  Some nights I feel like I have died

  Or something deep inside is dying

  I try to understand my crimes

  But there's nothing that really matters

  I don't want to believe in you

  I can't believe in you

  I don't want to believe in you

  I can't believe in you

  I don't want it

  I don't need it

  I don't want it

  I don't need it

  I don't want it

  I don't need it

  I don't want it

  But I can't stop myself

  Now endless questions fill my head

  Some nights i'm frightened by the answers

  No, you can't hurt me nothings real

  No pain you cause can last forever

  I don't want to believe in you

  I can't believe in you

  I don't want to believe in you

  I can't believe in you

  I don't want it

  I don't need it

  I don't want it

  I don't need it

  I don't want it

  I don't need it

  I don't want it

  But I can't stop myself

  One night I swore i'd die for you

  There's nothing else i'd rather die  for

  But I try to live another night

  There's to much hate to be forgotten

  I don't want to believe in you

  I can't believe in you

  I don't want to believe in you

  I can't believe in you

  I don't want it

  I don't need it

  I don't want it

  I don't need it

  I don't want it

  I don't need it

  I don't want it

  I don't need it

  I don't want it

  I don't need it

  I don't want it

  I don't need it

  I don't want it

  But I can't stop myself

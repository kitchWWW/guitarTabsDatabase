[Intro]
[ch]G[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch]
It was just like strapping 'em on and starting again[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Coaching these kids to the top, and calling them men[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
I was a third round pick in the NHL[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
And that's three years of living in hell[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
And going up flying, and going home dying[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch]
My life was over the boards and playing the game[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
And every day checking the papers and finding my name[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
And dad would go crazy when the scouts would call;[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
He'd tell me that I'd have it all[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
Ninety nine of us trying, only one of us flying[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And every kid over the boards listens for the sound;[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
The roar of the crowd is their ticket for finally leaving this town[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
To be just one more hopeful in the Junior A[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Dreaming of that miracle play[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
And going up flying, going home dying[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                                             [ch]G[/ch]
I tell them to think of the play and not of the fame[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
If they've got any future at all, it's not in the game[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
'Cause they'll be crippled and starting all over again[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Selling on commissions and remembering[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
When they were flying, remembering dying[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And every kid over the boards listens for the sound;[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
The roar of the crowd is their ticket for finally leaving this town[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
To be just one more hopeful in the Junior A[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Dreaming of that miracle play[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
And going up flying, going home dying[/tab]

(Repeat chorus)

Stan Rogers
Album: From Fresh Water (1984)

[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You say, "We'll-meet again, Lock-keeper![/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
We're laden even deeper that the time before[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Oriental oils and tea brought down from Singapore."[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
As we wait for my lock to cycle[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
I say, "My wife has just given me a son."[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
"A son!" you cry, "Is that all that you've done?"[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
She wears bougainvillea blossoms[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
You pluck 'em from her hair and toss 'em in the tide,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Sweep her in your arms and carry her inside.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Her sighs catch on your shoulder[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
Her moonlit eyes grow bold and wiser through her tears[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
And I say, "How could you stand to leave her for a year?"[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]Am[/ch]
"Then come with me" you say, "to where the Southern Cross[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Rides high upon your shoulder."[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]
"Come with me!" you cry,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
"Each day you tend this lock, you're one day older[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]     Stop
While your blood grows colder."[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
But that anchor chain's a fetter[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
And with it you are tethered to the foam[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
And I wouldn't trade your life for one hour of home.[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But I'm stuck here on the Seaway[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
While you compensate for leeway through the Trades;[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
And you shoot the stars to see the miles you've made.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And you laugh at hearts you've riven,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
But which of these has given us more love or life,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
You, your tropic maids, or me, my wife.[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]Am[/ch]
"Then come with me" you say, "to where the Southern Cross[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Rides high upon your shoulder."[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]
"Come with me!" you cry,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
"Each day you tend this lock, you're one day older[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]     Stop
While your blood grows colder."[/tab]

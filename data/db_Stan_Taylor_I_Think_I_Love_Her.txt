[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Her mother worked late[/tab]
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]
Her Daddy was long gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
The man who took his place[/tab]
[tab][ch]E7[/ch]
The damage he'd done, she'd never not know[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm7[/ch]
She couldn't run away[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Em7[/ch]
It's all she'd ever known[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm7[/ch]                      [ch]Em7[/ch]
Twenty years later let's see how[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E7[/ch]
she's grown[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
Overexposed in the sunlight[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E7[/ch]
With her tan skin watch her dancing[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am7[/ch]
Everybody knows, what she taste like[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E7[/ch]
But her body stays tight so it's hard not to like[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Dm7[/ch]
I think I love her[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em7[/ch]
And I think she loves me[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Dm7[/ch]
But she's got these demons darlin[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]
She can't release[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]

[tab]        [ch]E7[/ch]
That I was the one to save her soul[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Dm7[/ch]

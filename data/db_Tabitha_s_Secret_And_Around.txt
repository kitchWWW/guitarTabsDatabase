C                                                &lt;un-hand muted>

VERSE 2 (same as the frist verse):

Eighty six the candles, I'm scared of the bright lights
Girl, try not to touch me, so you don't feel me
Or you can touch my shoulder, put your lips to my ears and scream
Is there anyone home, won't you answer me 

CHORUS:

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I guess I've changed but yeah couldn't you[/tab]

Given all we've been through well[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch] 
Heaven knows I've been around and around[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I guess I've strained well how bout that[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Here's my life, here's a doorstep[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Heaven knows I've been around and around[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                            [ch]C[/ch]

[Verse]

[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
I gave it all up for you[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#m[/ch]
Came home at a decent time[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
Lost my bad attitude[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
'Cause I really wanna treat you nice[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
And maybe it's good for you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]
But something just don't sit right[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
I gave it all up for you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
And I wasted all of my time[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A/C#[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch]
When I could have had mad mad hoes[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]A[/ch]
Could have been filling up the bench on my roster[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A/C#[/ch]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
Been mile high club with the CEO[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Then came back home to a doctor[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
And I always cum last[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A/C#[/ch]
But I stay with your ass[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Got a heart by your name in my phone[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]A/C#[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch]
Even though we both know[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]  [ch]A/C#[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
I could have had mad mad hoes[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]
I don't get no butterflies[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
It don't make me smile when I look at you[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
But I don't look at other guys[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]
I promised that I would stay loyal to you so I do[/tab]


[Chorus 2]

[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A/C#[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch]
When I could have had mad mad hoes[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A/C#[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
Got down with the dude at the studio[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
Then came home to somebody hotter[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
And I always cum last[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A/C#[/ch]
But I stay with your ass[/tab]

Now I know im gun' get down on the floor
Experiencing what you cant ignore
But something bout this beat just got me hooked
Come over here and take a closer look

Coz I cant get enough, I cant get enough
I cant stay on the ground (woah)
I cant get enough, I cant get enough
This is taking me now

Its taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground (x2)

I do this for,
Its just for the thrill,
I got this high, were bout to get a feel

This move has got me way over the sun
Im dancing like I am the only one

Coz I cant get enough, I cant get enough
I cant stay on the ground (woah)
I cant get enough, I cant get enough
This is taking me now

Its taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground (x2)

The musics got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky

Its taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground (x4)

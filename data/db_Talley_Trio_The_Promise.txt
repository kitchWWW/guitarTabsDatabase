[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]                                      [ch]Db[/ch]             [ch]Ab[/ch]
A hand of fear gripped the crowd, that day at Jairus' home[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Eb[/ch]                  [ch]Ab[/ch]
When the doctor shook his head and said she's gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
You could feel that mother's heart break[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Db[/ch]                [ch]Ab[/ch]
You could hear them cry and mourn[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Eb[/ch]                [ch]Ab[/ch] 
Their little girl was only twelve years old[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
Somewhere in the distance[/tab]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]                   [ch]Ab[/ch]
Outlined against the sun[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Eb[/ch]              [ch]Ab[/ch]
There came a Man on a mission from the throne[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch] 
They said "look somebody's coming"[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Db[/ch]                [ch]Ab[/ch]
But what they did not know[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Eb[/ch]              [ch]Ab[/ch]
It was their Promise coming down that dusty road[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
There's a Promise coming down that dusty road[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]Eb[/ch]
From His holy hand healing virtue flows[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Ab[/ch]
He's got the keys to what you need[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Db[/ch]              [ch]Ab[/ch]
Death and hell He will defeat[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Eb[/ch]              [ch]Ab[/ch]
There's a Promise coming down that dusty road[/tab]


[Verse]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
The wonder turned to mocking[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
When Jesus did speak[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
'Cause He said your daughter's not dead She's just asleep[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]
Then He turned to the unbelievers[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
And He told them all "go home"[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]
They heard Him say "Leave Me and death alone."[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
And then He laid His hand upon the child[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
And He looked death right in the eye[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
He said, "All power in Heaven[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]
and earth it belongs to me"[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
And with a voice that sounds like thunder[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
He hurled death asunder [/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
He said "my child rise and be healed"[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
There's a Promise coming down that dusty road[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]Eb[/ch]
From His holy hand healing virtue flows[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Ab[/ch]
He's got the keys to what you need[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Db[/ch]              [ch]Ab[/ch]
Death and hell He will defeat[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Eb[/ch]              [ch]Ab[/ch]
There's a Promise coming down that dusty road[/tab]

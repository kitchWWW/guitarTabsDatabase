"Erica"
By Tattle Tale

There are basically only three chords played in this song.


[tab]e|--5-----4---1--2---|
B|--5-----5---2--3---|
G|--6-----6---3--4---|
D|--7-----6---4--4---|
A|--7-----4---5--2---|
E|--5-----X---X------|[/tab]



After the last chord, go back to the second chord, then back to the first.
Just repeat these and listen to the strumming pattern on the song.

Alright, it keeps saying my tab is too short or the tablature field is empty so I am
to fill up space.

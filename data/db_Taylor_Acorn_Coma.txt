CAPO 2

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
How the hell did I get here?[/tab]

What's the day, what's the year?
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
I barely recognize this bed that I just woke up in[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
Dress yourself up as a dream[/tab]

Sweet talked 'til I fell asleep
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
Convinced myself it was more peaceful just letting you in[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Hid your red flags well and damn I bought it[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
'Cause I spent four years in knowing what I wanted[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
I might as well have been dead[/tab]

The way you fucked with my head
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Couldn't tell up from down[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
No voice to make a sound[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
I must've not been awake[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Too numb to see your mistakes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
You probably liked it that way, hey[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
I blame myself, I should've known[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
I must've been stuck in a coma[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
         I should've known[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
How the hell did I get here?[/tab]

The hold you had on me, it disappeared
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
It's like the curtains opened up and let the sunlight in[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
Now I see you for the person you are[/tab]

You only wanted me when I was in the dark
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
You had the advantage that you were conscious[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I walkin' round nearly unresponsive[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
I might as well have been dead[/tab]

The way you fucked with my head
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Couldn't tell up from down[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
No voice to make a sound[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
I must've not been awake[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Too numb to see your mistakes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
You probably liked it that way, hey[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
I blame myself, I should've known[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
I must've been stuck in a coma[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
         I should've known[/tab]

[Bridge]

Hid the red flags well and damn I bought it[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
Can't get those four years back but damn I wanna[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
I might as well have been dead[/tab]

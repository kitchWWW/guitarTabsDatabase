SONG:   LEFT YOU INSTEAD
ARTIST: TAYLOR ACORN
VIDEO:  https://youtu.be/KMurZCF37yc
TAB BY: DON CZARSKI

NOTE: I prefer to play this without a capo and using barre chords. However, I
      did place a version (below the first tab) with a capo on the 3rd fret to
      make it perhaps easier to play with easier chords.

                          LEFT YOU INSTEAD

Always my fault when you're feeling sorry for yourself[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
You can take that and go to hell[/tab]

I'd stay patient while you sat and wasted the past three years[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
Now I'm out of tears to cry[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]             [ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
I hate that I spent all this time[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]Dm[/ch]
If I could get into your head[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]
And plant the same seed that you did[/tab]

[tab]                     [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
What if I left you in-stead, yeah[/tab]

I'd go ahead and make the first move[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
Before you make your next mistake[/tab]

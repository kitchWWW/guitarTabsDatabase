Artist: Teddy Grey
Song: I Love Lasagna
Genre: 
Key: 


The G is an all-finger G, played with the B string fretted on the third fret.

During the intermissions, the original cuts the guitar and just keeps the drum beat. I find it best to play
the continued G chord palm muted, but you can play around with this.

For the final chorus, he switches from the regular strum pattern to slower finger picking. Best emulated with
a forward-back-forward roll on the bass note, high E and B strings.

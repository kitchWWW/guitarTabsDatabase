[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Daug[/ch]
When I think about, and remember how[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
There was no way out and you rescued me[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
There's no reason why[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
You loved me then and you love me now[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
Least, no reason I can see[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]Daug[/ch]
You had always been my closest friend[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]
Even though I'd never defended that[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I was so far away[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
As far as ever I could stray[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
But You were there to bring me back[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
Thank you Jesus[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
For the grace that you have given us[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
We could ne'er repay[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
But from my heart I'd like to say[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
That I thank you[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]Daug[/ch]
There's so much to learn about how to turn[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
All Your words of life that burn in me[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Into a living fountain[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Flowing deep and flowing clean[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
So that all can come and drink[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]Daug[/ch]
But I know You're right there[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Willing to prepare[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]E[/ch]
This open heart of mine to carry on[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
to the place where I can be[/tab]

Your servant, be Your friend
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
One that you can depend on[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
Thank you Jesus[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
For the grace that you have given us[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
We could ne'er repay[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
But from my heart I'd like to say[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
That I thank you[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]						[ch]C[/ch]
I know you can and you should but you won't dear[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]						[ch]C[/ch]
took out a part of your heart when they don't cheer[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]					[ch]Bb[/ch]
was it a medal you got when you woke there?[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]F[/ch]	[ch]A[/ch]
on your own dear[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]						[ch]C[/ch]
When you were young you was hung up and lied to[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]				  [ch]C[/ch]
every man with a plan got inside you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]					       [ch]Bb[/ch]
was it the bottle you dropped when they found you?[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]F[/ch]	[ch]A[/ch]
on your own dear [/tab]

[tab]	  [ch]D[/ch]	[ch]G[/ch]	      [ch]D[/ch]
And it's clear right on the page[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]		  [ch]G[/ch]
this is your battlescar[/tab]
[tab]	  [ch]D[/ch]	[ch]G[/ch]	      [ch]D[/ch]
and it's clear, clear as the day[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]		  [ch]G[/ch]
you got your battlescar[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]			      [ch]D[/ch]
hey I know, ya I know, ya I know[/tab]


[tab][ch]D[/ch]					[ch]C[/ch]
Now that youâ€™re tossed on a sea of emotion[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]				[ch]C[/ch]
every cut is as deep as the ocean[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]					[ch]Bb[/ch]
was it a drag when you woke up to no one?[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]F[/ch]	[ch]A[/ch]
on your own dear [/tab]


[tab]	  [ch]D[/ch]	[ch]G[/ch]	      [ch]D[/ch]
And it's clear right on the page[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]		  [ch]G[/ch]
this is your battlescar[/tab]
[tab]	  [ch]D[/ch]	[ch]G[/ch]	      [ch]D[/ch]
and it's clear, clear as the day[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]		  [ch]G[/ch]
you got your battlescar[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]			      [ch]D[/ch]
hey I know, ya I know, ya I know[/tab]


[tab]     [ch]Bb[/ch]				[ch]F[/ch]
The fun that you don't really need[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]		   [ch]Bb[/ch]			      [ch]F[/ch]
opens you up like books that you don't even read[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]			[ch]Bb[/ch]
and pays you a lot to talk[/tab]
[tab]		      [ch]F[/ch]
when you don't even know[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]			[ch]A[/ch]
this scar will fade in time[/tab]


[tab]	  [ch]D[/ch]	[ch]G[/ch]	      [ch]D[/ch]
And it's clear right on the page[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]		  [ch]G[/ch]
this is your battlescar[/tab]
[tab]	  [ch]D[/ch]	[ch]G[/ch]	      [ch]D[/ch]
and it's clear, clear as the day[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]		  [ch]G[/ch]
you got your battlescar[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]			      [ch]D[/ch]
hey I know, ya I know, ya I know[/tab]

Artist: The 88
Song: No One Here
Genre: 
Key: 


Tabbed by Sam de Brunner
Tuning: Standard
No Capo
Based on the piano version (oddly named acoustic version on youtube)


Playing these transitions makes the song sound better, however the song still 
sounds great without them as until recently I didn't use them so don't worry if it 
is too confusing to read and work out:

In the transition from G to Em strum a G chord, then quickly strum one open chord 
with no strings held down, then an Em.

In the transition from Em to G strum an Em, then an open chord with no strings 
held down, then another Em, then another open chord with no strings held down, 
before going on to the G chord.

In my opinion this technique of playing sounds best (and most like the actual 
song) if the chords with no strings held down are strummed up from the high e 
string to the low E string, while the other chords are all strummed downwards 
however feel free to play it whatever way feels right for you.

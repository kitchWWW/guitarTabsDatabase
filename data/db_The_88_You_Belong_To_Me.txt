[tab][ch]G[/ch]/[ch]Eb[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
I treat it like a high school dance[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
Waiting in the wings for my big chance[/tab]

[tab][ch]Fmaj7[/ch]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
But I would only stare at my shoes[/tab]

[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
You belong to me I belong to you[/tab]


I could tell an antique lie
Full of all the things I want to hide
But that would only lead to the truth
You belong to me I belong to you

[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
But I'm lazy and I'll pull you down[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Where you won't want to be[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
And I'm tasting what's pouring out of you[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]   [ch]Cm[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
    What am I supposed to do?[/tab]

I could play a trick so strange
Cover up my ears and pray for rain
But that would only give you the blues
You belong to me I belong to you

[Verse 1]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]Bm[/ch]
I thought I made it clear as crystal[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]
It doesn't have to be this hard[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]Bm[/ch]
But you ain't good at reading signals[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
When they come straight from the heart[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 1]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
You've been thinking, you've been thinking[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Bm[/ch]
Overthinking, you've been thinking, babe[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Just a little too much[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bm[/ch]
I wish you knew what I want[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
I been looking, I been looking[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
I been looking in the mirror[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Making little touch ups[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]Bm[/ch]
And I hope you know that I want you[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
I've been sitting here waiting[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]Bm[/ch]

[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]
I've sent out invitations[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]

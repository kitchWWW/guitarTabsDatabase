[tab]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
The great British mistake was looking for a way out,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]Bb[/ch]
Was getting complacent, not noticing the pulse was racing.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
The mistake was fighting the change, was staying the same.[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]              [ch]Bb[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
It couldn't adapt so it couldn't survive.,[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]F[/ch]
Something had to give.[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]
The people take a downhill slide into the gloom.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Into the dark recesses of their minds.[/tab]

[ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Bm[/ch] 
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                            
  I swoop over your city like a bird.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                 
  I climb the high branches and observe.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                         
  Into the mouth, into the soul.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                  
  I cast a shadow that swallows you whole.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]Bm[/ch]    
  I swoop, I climb,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]       
 I cling,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
   I suck, I swallow you whole.[/tab]

String out the drip-feed, they're losing their world,[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]
They're losing their hard boys and magazine girls.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bb[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Advert illegal, T.V. as outlaw, motive as spell.[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
They'll see the books burn. They'll be 4-5-1.[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]Bb[/ch]
It's people against things and not against each other.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bb[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Out of the pre-pack, into the fear, into themselves.[/tab]


[Verse 5]
[tab]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]
They're the great British mistake.[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]
The genie's out of the bottle, call in the magician.[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
They didn't mean to free him, devil behind them,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
devil in the mirror, chained to their right hands.[/tab]


[Verse 6]
[tab]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
They're the great British mistake.[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]
They'll have to come to terms now, they'll take it out somehow.[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Bb[/ch]
They'll blame it all on something.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bb[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
The British mistake - when will it be over?[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
How can they avoid it, avoid it, avoid it?[/tab]

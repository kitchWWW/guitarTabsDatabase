Artist: The Antlers
Song: Parade
Genre: 
Key: 


This is the main guitar part that's repeated throughout the first section (~2 minutes) of the song 
(as best as I can hear it). Some of these chords sound a little off on their own. If you play along 
with the song though, they'll make more sense.

standard tuning

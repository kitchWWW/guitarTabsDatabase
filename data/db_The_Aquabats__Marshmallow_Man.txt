[tab] [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Hey big fella I see you're outta jail[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
You got a brand new hat[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
You're walking big You're walking tall[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
With your brand new baseball bat[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]
You've got your beeper[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
You've got your gun[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
And a whole bunch of cool tattoos[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Start fights at the pits at all the shows[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
So everybody will look at you[/tab]


(CHORUS CHORDS)
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
You're ignorant It's knowledge you lack[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
You gotta fight everything you can[/tab]


(You're such a fool)
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
A big puffy head You're the marshmallow man[/tab]


(VERSE CHORDS)
Straight outta Compton Is your battle cry
But you're from a suburban track
Didn't your mom and dad teach you
That ghetto stuff is really whack?
What happened to the little Puffy headed boy we all once knew?
Marshmallow man you better watch yourself
Before someone steps on you


(CHORUS CHORDS)
Check yourself before You wreck yourself
A little man with a gun in his hand
(You're such a fool)
Big marshmallow man

Intro [G*] x4

They say you're got to lose a couple fights to win [[ch]C[/ch]]
[[ch]D[/ch]]It's hard to tell from where I'm sitting [[ch]G[/ch]]
They say that this is where the fun begins [[ch]C[/ch]]
[[ch]D[/ch]]I guess it's time that I was quitting[[ch]G[/ch]]

[[ch]Em[/ch]]A slight figure [[ch]D[/ch]] of speech
[[ch]G[/ch]]I cut my chest [[ch]C[/ch]] wide open
[[ch]Em[/ch]]They come and [[ch]D[/ch]] watch us bleed
[[ch]G[/ch]]Is it art like I was [[ch]C[/ch]] hoping now?

G*

They said "I hope that you will never change"
I went and cut my hair
They say "Don't take your business to the big time"
I bought us tickets there

A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it art like I was hoping now?

What did you expect
And what did you forget
That to live you let go of me with each step
It becomes a progression I won't let regret manifest
To aggression
Are you to assess what I've been? What I am? Or become?
Did you stop to accept how pathetically dumb
It can be to
Attack those around 'cause you're
True to color, a town, a time, or a place?
It's not you, it's not mine
And besides it is gone
And you never will find it again
But I don't want to fight
I just ask let me be
I won't give the chance to be my enemy
So go home
Think it through

A jet plane and a big idea
I jump over the sea
What ifs hot on my trail
But that can't catch me, no

A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it art like I was hoping now?

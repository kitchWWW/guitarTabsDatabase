[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                               [ch]G[/ch]                                   
I know that you're smiling, baby, I don't even need to see your face[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                           [ch]G[/ch]
Sunset at the shoreline, we are laughing, breaking up, just like the waves[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
Are you feeling, feeling, feeling like I'm, feeling like [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
I'm floating, floating, up above that big blue ocean[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                       [ch]G[/ch]
Sand beneath our feet, big blue sky above our heads, no need to keep[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
Stressing from our everyday life, on our minds,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]              
We have got to leave all that behind[/tab]
[ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Well, I have got a sister, and she has got a baby, with brand new eyes[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                                                           [ch]G[/ch]
And her daddy is an engineer, and they just took her to the sea for, the first time[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
Now they're under, under, underneath a big umbrella[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                              [ch]D[/ch]
Summer, summer, summer time to help us forget, nine to fives[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
We have got to leave all that behind[/tab]

[Solo]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
I have, worries, to give to the sea[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
We can, walk dear, the pier is farther than it seems[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Midnight at the shoreline, fireworks above us, a screaming bloom[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                                                    [ch]G[/ch]
They're sent by some teenager, and kid whoever you are, I am thanking you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
Now we're dancing, dancing, dancing with no music[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
What is happening, happening, happening and no feelings[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
Except this is right[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
We just had to leave all that behind[/tab]

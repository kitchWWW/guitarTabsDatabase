beside the yellow line[/tab]

'Bout five years ago,
I came about this way, but I doubt they'll know my face
The land hasn't changed
The stars still pierce the black, and I'm glad that I came back
Beside the yellow line

The mind of a girl,
It's hard to understand, but I guess 'cause I'm a man
Her heart fears are unknown,
Until I am gone, gotta leave her all alone
Beside the yellow line

And the call of the road,
Unlike the railroad tracks, unlike the airplane path
Her voice floats, through the land
and it takes me by the hand, so once again I stand
Beside the yellow line

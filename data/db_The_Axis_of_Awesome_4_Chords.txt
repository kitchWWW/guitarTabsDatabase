Lyrics/
My life is brilliant, my love is pure.
I saw an angel, of this I'm sure.
Wherever you go, whatever you do,
I will by right here waiting for you.
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling.
This is the way you left me.
I'm not pretending.
No love no hope no glory,
No happy ending.
Thanks, you were fuel for thought.
Now I'm more lonely than before, but that's OK.
People killed and people dying,
Children hurt and women crying.
If you practice what you preach,
You can turn the other cheek.
'Cause you are amazing.
Oh we did amazing things.
If I could, then I would.
I'll go wherever you will go.
Don't let the days go by.
So tell me why should I let you go.
'Cause we are gonna be, forever you and me.
And where I go I just don't know.
I gotta gotta gotta take it slow.
Say you're gonna stay, now I need to know it.
And I wanna TV embrace.
And she will be loved.
Yeah she will be loved.
Oh I can't live, with or without you.
Whenever I fall, at your feet.
You let your tears...
Am I not pretty enough?
Is my heart too broken?

When I find myself in times of trouble,
Mother Mary comes to me.
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner.
I'm starting with the man in the mirror.
Can you feel the love tonight?
I come from a land down under.
Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong.
Do I cry too much? Am I too unspoken?
Take on me! (Take on me.)
Take me on! (Take on me.)
I'll be gone
In a day or two!

Save tonight, and find the break of dawn.
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone.
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you.
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do.
I know she's playing with me.
Well that's okay 'cause I got no self-esteem. (Oh way ohh yeah)
It's alright. (Yeah)
To tell me.
What you think. (Ohh)
About me. (Yeahh)
I won't try. (Yeah)
To argue. (Yeah)
Or hold it. (Ohh)
Against you. (Yeah, yeah)
It's too late too apologize.
It's too late.
Take your canvas bags.
Take your canvas bags.
Take your canvas bags to the supermarket.
Take your canvas bags.
Nothing's right I'm torn.
I'm all out of faith.
This is how I feel.
I'm cold and I am shamed.
Lying naked on the floor.
Illusion never changed into something real.
I'm quite awake and I can see
I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane.
I'm a birdplane.
I'm a birdplane. A mother fuckin' birdplane.

Doesn't that sound familiar?
Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver,
The way that things have gone? 
And doesn't that seem peculiar,
'Cause everyone wants a little more? 
It's something I do remember
to never go this far.
That's all it takes to be a star.

END.

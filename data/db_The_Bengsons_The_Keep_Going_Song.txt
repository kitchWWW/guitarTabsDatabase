[Verse 1]
               
Heyheyayay
                                    
I am Abigail, and this is Shaun
                                                 
And we’re so glad that you’ve turned this on
                                       
And welcomed us into your home and
                                  
You are welcome into our home
                                              
We’re in Dayton Ohio-oooooh (Dayton Ohio)
                                                   
In Shaun’s parents’ house. (My parents’ house)
                           
Shaun’s parent’s house
                                      
We’re in Louisville when the shit
        
Hit
                                                
And we packed our three year old into a car
                       
We drove kinda far
                  
We drove here
                                                      
And we are so lucky and blessed to be safely here
                                                         
And we thought we’d be here for like ten days, tops!
                                          
(What did we know?) What did we know?
                                          
(What did we know?) What did we know?
                             
We thought we knew a lot
                             
We thought we knew a lot

[Chorus]
                              
Woooo! Keep going on song
                                                    
This is the keep going keep going keep going on
                       
Keep going on song
                                                    
This is the keep going keep going keep going on
                       
Keep going on song


[Verse 2]
                                  
And we’ve been mostly healthy
                                   
We’ve been okay. Are you okay?
                                   
Are you alright? Are you okay?
                                   
Are you alright? Are you okay?
                                      
I hope your body is whole tonight
                                  
And if your heart is breaking
                              
I hope it’s breaking open
                                  
And if your breath is shaking
                               
I hope it’s shaking though
                                            
And I hope that you’ve watched a lot of
                            
Really great television
                       
Like, a lot of it!
                                                
And I hope that you find a hand lotion that
                                         
Actually makes your skin feel better
                                           
And I hope that you have enough to eat
                                     
Hope you’re getting enough sleep
                                            
And I hope you have enough good company
                          
Or enough good memory
                            
To last you a long time

[Chorus]
                                        
Keep going keep going keep going on
                       
Keep going on song
                                                               
We sing the keep going keep going keep going keep going on
                       
Keep going on song


[Verse 3]
                                                 
Let’s bring some joy into the room. Why not?
                                     
We could try it. We could try it
                 
Or some rage
                   
And some grief
               
And relief
                              
Ooooh-woah I hold my rage
                             
I pray my rage is a fire
                            
That cleans my mind out
                                 
And makes me ready to listen
                              
I pray my pain is a river
                            
That flows to the ocean
                                   
That connects my pain to yours
                                                  
And I pray I pray my happiness is like pollen
                                                    
That flys to you and pollenates your joy oh boy
                             
Oh boy is that possible?
                              
I don’t know I don’t know
                                   
We are making this up as we go
                                   
We have to make it up as we go


                        
The keep going song
                           
The keep going on song
                          
Oh we’re making it up
                                
We’re making it up as we go
                                        
Keep going keep going keep going on
                       
Keep going on song


[Verse 4]
               
And I pray
                       
When we meet again
                               
That the world has changed
                                                    
Into the world that we are imaging now together
                                         
And I pray that the world has become
                                                      
The world that we’re planting inside of ourselves
                   
For each other
                      
For our ancestors
                     
And for our kids
             
Oo-oo-oh
                             
And we’re going to start
                         
We’re going to start
                              
This is a rough beginning
                        
That’s all I’ve got
                         
Is a rough beginning
                 
To offer you
                                               
We’re going to start by singing some songs
                                
In this tiny space together
                                                
We’re just going to sing some songs for you
                                        
And we hope that when you hear them
                                          
You will feel a little bit less alone
                                             
And we will feel a little bit less alone
                
In the work
                    
And in the hurt
                                            
And we will be together tonight somehow
                     
Whenever this is
                     
Wherever this is
                                
We will be together tonight


            
For the
                                        
Keep going keep going keep going on

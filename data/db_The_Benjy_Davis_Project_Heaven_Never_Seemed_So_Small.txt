If you had told me long ago how lucky I would be I'd say forget it man. If you should 
me years from now that love has passed you by I'd say go get it.

I see it all, and heaven never seemed so small[/tab]

If you asked me if i would spend the rest of life with you I'd say "Lets live it girl." 
from your mouth I love so much came hurtful words I hate, I would forgive them.

Cause books can not explain the way

She makes me feel inside

Looks are just a part of her,

Her heart is where I hide

And here's a thought for those of you

Who think that love is blind

I see it all, and heaven never seemed so small

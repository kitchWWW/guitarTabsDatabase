Prove You Wrong

By: Benjy Davis

Intro: [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I called you something terrible[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
Told you not to call[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]
Held you like I didn't care[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
While you tried not to fall and I[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
Done you wrong, I know the song[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
And I know how it ends[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
And I'm sorry, I'm so sorry you're my best friend[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
Watched you drive away[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
Even wave goodbye[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]
And I was fine with everything I said[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
When I got back inside[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I was confronted by this heartache[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
And I know exactly why - and what I'll do[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Gonna treat you like I want somebody else to.[/tab]

CHORUS:
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
I'm gonna be a better man[/tab]
Than the one I was last night
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
I'm gonna show you who I am[/tab]
I'm swallowing my pride
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
I know right now you think I'm just another waste of time[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
I'm gonna prove you wrong, no lie[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Say goodbye to the old me, hello Mr. Right[/tab]


This world has been a whirlwind
Driving blind and dodging trains
And I was scared and you were scared and we were both scared of the same thing
I want to see you out, put on that old dress
I need to get you in the candlelight of an old Italian restaurant
Your eyes bring out the room, babe
Go ahead, it's safe to assume
It's safe to assume

CHORUS

[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
Didn't mean to leave you out[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Just to remove any doubt......[/tab]

CHORUS

*Side Note*
   -When I tabbed this song, I capo-ed the third fret to try and get more of the high
is heard on the mandolin.  It stays in the key of G.  The only change is that the G is
in an "E-major formation" and the C is played in an "A-major formation".  The change 
the open sounding chords to ring, like the mandolin.  Of course, all of the other chords
be played as bar chords (which I think Benjy does in some of the song anyway, but 
at the Chorus E-minor walk-down part) There was a diminished chord at the end of the bridge 
I couldn't quite get (probably because of my capo set-up) but the C fills in decently.

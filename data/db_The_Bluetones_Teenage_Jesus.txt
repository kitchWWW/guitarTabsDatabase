Teenage Jesus by The Bluetones
Tabbed by Mike McConnell

[tab][ch]A[/ch] , [ch]Bm[/ch] , [ch]C#m[/ch] , [ch]D[/ch]
I knew a teenage Jesus.[/tab]
He was a friend of mine.
He gave me all the answers, he fed me bread and wine.
Me and the other disciples, we understood his mind.
He had so many secrets.
He had such little time.

[tab][ch]E[/ch] , [ch]D[/ch]
And I’ll keep in my head all the words that he said.[/tab]
And I’ll keep in my heart all his love.
And I’ll be at his side in just a while.
I knew a teenage Jesus.

I brought him to the dream.
He had the coolest sandals that I have ever seen.
“I want to be like you.”
I said “I want to be a star.”
He took my hand in his hand and said “You already are.”

And I’ll keep in my head all the words that he said.
And I’ll keep in my heart all his love.
And I’ll be at his side in just a while.

Hallelujah.
Um and hallelujah.
Hallalujah.
Um and Hallelujah.

I’ll keep in my head all the words that he said.
And I’ll keep in my heart all his love.
I said I’ll keep in my head all the words that he said.
And I’ll be at his side in just a while.
Happy Birthday Jesus.

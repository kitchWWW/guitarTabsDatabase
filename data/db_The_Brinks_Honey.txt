[Verse 1]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
Swimming in the river, open my eyes[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Thinking the past was out of my sight[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe we'll get there, might as well try[/tab]
[tab]                                                  [ch]C[/ch]
I'm drunk and this cigarette's burning with the high[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Wherever I fit in, is where you belong[/tab]
[tab]                                          [ch]C[/ch]
Come on baby bounce to the feeling, get born[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
She was all naked, passenger seat[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
Horn from the Cadillac going beep beep[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]Dm[/ch]
Ooh-ooh, drip, drip like honey[/tab]

Ooh-ooh, drip, drip like honey[/tab]
[tab]                                                 [ch]C[/ch]
She's the kind that make me wanna, make me come alive[/tab]

[tab]                                                    [ch]C[/ch]
She's the kind that make you wanna, make you wanna ride[/tab]


[Post-Chorus]

Don't bend yourself out of shape
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Don't get your right mind erased[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Looking all faded, riding on the wind[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Cm[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Thinking over this for what it could have been[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe we'll uncover there's a dark side[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Searching your skin 'til we're gonna feel right[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]Am[/ch]
I see you in the mirror, I see you in the stars[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]C[/ch]
I feel you in the thunder, drumming my heart[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]D[/ch]
It's everything we wanted, wanted to believe[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Casual love, no casualties[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
On a tidal wave, Hollywood skin[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
Baby she was sex, she was on her way in[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
She was all naked, passenger seat[/tab]

Horn from the Cadillac going beep beep

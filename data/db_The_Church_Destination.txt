THE CHURCH: “DESTINATION”
Chords by Ney Young

Intro: [ch]Am[/ch]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Our instruments have no way of measuring this feeling[/tab]
Can never cut below the floor, or penetrate the ceiling
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
In the space between our houses, some bones have been discovered[/tab]
But our procession lurches on, as if we had recovered

[ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] (2x)

[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
Draconian winter unforetold[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
One solar day, suddenly you're old[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Your little envelope just makes me cold[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]  
Makes destination start to unfold[/tab]

[ch]Am[/ch]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Our documents are useless, or forged beyond believing[/tab]
Page forty-seven is unsigned, I need it by this evening
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
In the space between our cities, a storm is slowly forming[/tab]
Something eating up our days, I feel it every morning

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] (4x)
Destination, destination[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]  
It's not a religion, it's just a technique[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
It's just a way of making you speak[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
Distance and speed have left us too weak[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
And destination looks kind of bleak[/tab]

[ch]G[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] (2x)
[ch]Am[/ch]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Our elements are burned out, our beasts have been mistreated[/tab]
I tell you it's the only way we'll get this road completed
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
In the space between our bodies, the air has grown small fingers[/tab]
Just one caress, you're powerless, like all those clapped-out swingers

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] (4x)
Destination, destination[/tab]

[ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]

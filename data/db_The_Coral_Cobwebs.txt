I'll take any corrections to the lyrics!

INTRO
[ch]E[/ch]

VERSE 1
There's a place where the creatures play I'm going there at the end of the day
[ch]E[/ch]				        [ch]Bm[/ch]		   [ch]C#m[/ch]		 [ch]F#m[/ch]

Who knows what I'll find, in the cobwebs of my mind.
 [ch]B[/ch]			         [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]			          [ch]E[/ch]

There's a face in the photograph in the attic beside the mask
[ch]E[/ch]			        [ch]Bm[/ch]		  [ch]C#m[/ch]	          [ch]F#m[/ch]

Closer to the tide in the cobwebs of my mind.
[ch]B[/ch]		     [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]			     [ch]E[/ch]

BRIDGE
From the watch house to the marshes far away the signs to how we make
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch] 								            [ch]G#m[/ch]
and she'll show me the way[/tab]
         [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]

VERSE 2
We'll stick together through the thick and thin, let's go out that's where I begin
[ch]E[/ch]				                   [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]C#m[/ch]                 
[tab]              [ch]F#m[/ch]
now I'm lost inside in the cobwebs of my mind.[/tab]
[ch]B[/ch]	                 [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]E[/ch]

 [ch]E[/ch]

There's a place where the music plays, I'll meet her there at the end of the day
Who knows what she'll find in the cobwebs of my mind.
When she moves her beauty falls in the garden the masters call
She knows where I hide in the cobwebs of my mind
She reads my eyes, she reads my eyes

Repeat Solo to fade

[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Oh, cruel is the snow that sweeps Glencoe,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
and covers the grave o' Donald.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]

and murdered the house o' MacDonald.[/tab]


[Verse 1]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
They came in the blizzard, we offered them heat,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
a roof o'er their heads, dry shoes for their feet.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
We wined them and dined them, they ate o' our meat,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
and they slept in the house o' MacDonald.[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
and covers the grave o' Donald.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
And cruel was the foe that raped Glencoe,[/tab]

and murdered the house o' MacDonald.[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
They came from Fort William with murder in mind,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
the Campbell had orders King William had signed:[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
Put all to the sword, these words underlined,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
And leave none alive called MacDonald.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Oh, cruel is the snow that sweeps Glencoe,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
and covers the grave o' Donald.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
And cruel was the foe that raped Glencoe,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
and murdered the house o' MacDonald.[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
They came in the night when the men were asleep,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
this band of Argyles, through snow soft and deep.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]
Like murdering foxes, among helpless sheep,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
they slaughtered the house o' MacDonald.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Oh, cruel is the snow that sweeps Glencoe,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
and covers the grave o' Donald.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
And cruel was the foe that raped Glencoe,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
and murdered the house o' MacDonald.[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
Some died in their beds at the hands o' the foe,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
some fled in the night, were lost in the snow.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Some lived to accuse him, what struck the first blow,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
but gone was the house of MacDonald.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Oh, cruel is the snow that sweeps Glencoe,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
and covers the grave o' Donald.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
And cruel was the foe that raped Glencoe,[/tab]

and murdered the house o' MacDonald.[/tab]

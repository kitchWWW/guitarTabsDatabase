Verse:
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]    
Is now time to say the goodbyes and the thank yous?[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]    
Is now the time to fade into the bluest of the blue blues?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
And oh, it'll feel bad for a while, they say (That's what they say) [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]       
And the worst night is the first night alone, oh[/tab]

chorus:
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
Oh what a thing, oh what a thing we had; everything. See?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
Oh what a thing! (Oh what a thing!)[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]
Nothing was wrong, no, till you were gone and I was alone[/tab]

verse:
Is now the time to say: "I guess we just ran out of breath"?
Is now the time to say: "Baby, this ain't no matter of life and death"?
But that is not true and I can't lie to you my love
Plus, I ain't talking when you're walking away

chorus:
Oh what a thing, oh what a thing we had; everything. See?
Oh what a thing! (Oh what a thing!)
Nothing was wrong, no, till you were gone and I was alone

[tab]             [ch]Dm[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
Oh, tell me, was it too much of a good thing, baby?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
Oh, I would do the same mistakes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                              [ch]Em[/ch]
Or did you had enough of the perfection maybe?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]G#[/ch]
Oh, I would do it all over again[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]C#[/ch]   [ch]Fm[/ch]          [ch]Bbm[/ch]                [ch]C#[/ch]         [ch]Fm[/ch]
Because, oh what a thing, oh what a thing we had; everything. See?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bbm[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]
Oh what a thing! (Oh what a thing!)[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C#[/ch]     [ch]Fm[/ch]                [ch]Bbm[/ch]  [ch]Bbm[/ch]/[ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]Bbm[/ch]/[ch]G#[/ch]
Nothing was wrong, no, till you were gone,      till you were gone[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bbm[/ch]/[ch]G[/ch]    [ch]F#[/ch]       [ch]C#maj7[/ch]

Lyrics
I will keep the bad things from you
I will keep a straight face honey
you can keep your last name if you want to
and I will give you all my money
I could take a plane right to you
if i could just stop running
what if all this was true?

I will keep the bank from calling
I will keep those bastards from you
I will keep your smile from falling
this time the casualties were few
'cause we kept the bastards brawling
we kept our hearts from view
this time we're problem solving

catch it while you can
its the feel good hit of the summer
catch it while you can
'cause there won't be another

you keep the band names coming
I'll make the jokes real funny
we'll keep the skeptics humming
and someone else will take the money
we'll keep the hamsters running
I'll be the sour in your tummy
who'll wipe the nose that's running

catch it while you can
its the feel good hit of the summer
catch it while you can
'cause there won't be another

I will sleep above the covers
I will love you like no other
I will be your dad and mother
I will give you older brothers
I will feed you fries with steak sauce
I will keep the price below the cost
I will lead the way from all is lost
I will keep the bad things from you 

catch it while you can
its the feel good hit of the summer
catch it while you can
'cause there won't be another... won't be another...

I'll keep the bad things from you...
I'll keep the bad things from you...
I'll keep the bad things from you...

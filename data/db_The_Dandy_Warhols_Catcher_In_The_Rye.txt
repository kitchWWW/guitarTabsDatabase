Song that catched my eye, if you know what I mean. Very easy to play and still alot of fun! Just make quick up
and down strokes and catch the groove. I use powerchords because they sound better in my opinion

If there is any feedback contact me at my UG page! 

Dandy's rule O.K? Enjoy the song! :) 

Cheers.

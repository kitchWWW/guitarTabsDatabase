[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Nothing is wrong here so I'm climbing up the walls[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]A[/ch]
Trying to kill this silence with gun blasts and alcohol[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
I've been laughing, I've been crying, I've been living, I've been dying[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
They say tell the truth, they're lying, Hallelu[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                                            [ch]A[/ch]
Hallelu, Hallelu, praise the lord and pass the ammunition too[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
They say Jesus is coming, he must be walking, he sure ain't running[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Who can blame him, look how we done him, Hallelu[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
What will it take to have this place on bended knee[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
You run to the forest, you can bet I'll burn the trees[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
I will poison the water 'cause it's only getting hotter[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
And we came for sons and daughters, Hallelu[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                                            [ch]A[/ch]
Hallelu, Hallelu, praise the lord and pass the ammunition too[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
They say Jesus is coming, he must be walking, he sure ain't running[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Who can blame him, look how we done him, Hallelu[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Trials and tribulations, that's just bread and wine[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
Getting my hands dirty, that does not take off the shine[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch]
On this farm to get your filling, there's got to be a little killing[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
So I am ready and I'm willing, Hallelu[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                                            [ch]A[/ch]
Hallelu, Hallelu, praise the lord and pass the ammunition too[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
They say Jesus is coming, he must be walking, he sure ain't running[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Who can blame him, look how we done him, Hallelu[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
If you're waiting on salvation you'll need candles and libations[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Train ain't coming in the station, Hallelu[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
They say Jesus is coming, he must be walking, he sure ain't running[/tab]

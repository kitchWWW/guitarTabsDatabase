[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Word has come from Dublin City[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
She's lost her sweet angry boy[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch] 
Born with a spirit his flesh could not contain[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Brendan Behan is dead[/tab]

   
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
No stranger to life, he lived bright enough[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
No stranger to the glass in his hand[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
No stranger to the cause he fought for all his life [/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Brendan Behan is dead[/tab]


[ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]


[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
A hungry feeling came over me stealing[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
While the mice were feeding in my prison cell [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
And the old triangle went jingle jangle[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
All along the banks of the royal canal[/tab]


[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
On a fine spring evening as I lay dreaming [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
And the lad was weeping for his gal Sal[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
And the old triangle went jingle jangle[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
All along the banks of the royal canal[/tab]


[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
And the wind was sighing as the day was dying[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
And the lad still crying in his prison cell[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]
And the old triangle went jingle bloody jangle[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
All along the banks of the royal canal[/tab]


[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
In the women's prison there are seventy women[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
And I wish it was with them that I did dwell[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
Then that old triangle could go jingle bloody jangle[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
All along the banks of the royal canal[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
Then that old triangle could go jingle bloody jangle[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
All along the banks of the royal canal[/tab]


[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
Ireland has lost her sweet angry singer[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
No longer his poems fine design [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Will ring out in Gaelic, or sound through the Main[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Brendan Behan is dead [/tab]

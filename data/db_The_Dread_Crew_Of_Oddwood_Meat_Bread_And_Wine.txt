Join us around the fire as we tell heroic tales[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
Of times before, away from shore, yes times when we set sail[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                                   [ch]B[/ch]

And women more charming than you'd possibly believe[/tab]

Mead for good measure, since meat is only food[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Juicy roasted chicken, pork-filled sausages and beer[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                  [ch]B[/ch]
If we're still awake we'll play our instruments all night[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
And sing of mighty men and queens and daring fights[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                                       [ch]B[/ch]
We'll fill your dreams with pirate ships, with whales and giant squid[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
And cities burning to the ground through evil deeds we did[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Mead for good measure, since meat is only food[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]

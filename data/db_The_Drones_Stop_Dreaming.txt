[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
It ain't like you saw it coming[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
It ain't like you were all there[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
In that space between chance and trying[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
There ain't much time to get things straight[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
I've seen you beat yourself to stupor[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
And I've seen you sleeping late[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
You got a right to say times have worn you down[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
But don't be heavier than they[/tab]

[Chorus 1]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
You should get your shit together[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
You should really have a try[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]Fm[/ch]
Cause that sun it also rises[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
And you'll look like shit man[/tab]

When you meet that light

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
You and most no one else Don't get along too well[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
And you'd like to think that you can't[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]Em[/ch]
But there's a stranger I know wants to meet you[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
He's got the same name as yours and he's wearing your pants[/tab]

[Chorus 2]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
You should get your shit together[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
You should really have a try[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]
You'll be waking up old[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Fm[/ch]
By a stranger so cold[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
And that's no way nobody[/tab]
Be needing to go

[Instrumental]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] x2

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I said[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Stop dreaming and get on[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Stop dreaming and live on[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
There is still something left[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]
Beneath the ribs in your chest[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
Your just in need of some reminding[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]Em[/ch]
It ain't all about loss and a loneliness[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
There's a time and a place[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
For a grown man to cry[/tab]

[Chorus 3]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
You should get your shit together[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah you should really have a try[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]Fm[/ch]
That sun it also rises, man[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You're gonna look like shit[/tab]
When you, you meet that light

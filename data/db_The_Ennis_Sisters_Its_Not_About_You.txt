[Intro]
[ch]A[/ch] - [ch]D[/ch] - [ch]A[/ch] - [ch]D[/ch] - (4x's)


[Verse 1]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
I'll pick up what's left of my broken heart,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]
Pack it out back in the trunk of my car,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C#m[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]Esus/E[/ch]
And follow the white line 'till I'm feeling fine again,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
I'll let the rain drown my sorrows tonight,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
But when I wake up I'll let the light,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C#m[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]     [ch]Esus/E[/ch]
Try to convince me I'm back on my feet again,[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
It's not about you, I'm finally walking,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]
I'm singing inside, I can't hear you talking,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]C#m[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
And you can't believe it's true, It's not about you[/tab]


[Verse 2]

I'll do what I can not to turn back now
I've come this far and I know somehow
I'll keep on looking 'till I find me again


[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
It's not about you, I'm finally walking,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]
I'm singing inside, I can't hear you talking,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]C#m[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
And you can't believe it's true, It's not about you[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
I'm going to drive all night,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C#m[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]
Sort through this thing 'till I make it right,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You can't believe it,[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch] - [ch]A[/ch] - [ch]F#m[/ch] - [ch]D[/ch]
Can't even believe it's true,[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch] - [ch]F#m[/ch] - [ch]D[/ch]
It's not about you.[/tab]

Arms of Mary  
 
[tab][ch]A[/ch]		 [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]		 [ch]D[/ch] 
The lights shine down the valley, the wind blows up the alley[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]D4[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch]
Oh and I wish I was lyin’ in the arms of Mary [/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]             
She took the pains of boyhood and turned them into feel-good[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]  
Oh how I wish I was lyin’ in the arms of Mary[/tab]

Chorus:
[tab]             [ch]C#m[/ch]		      [ch]F#m[/ch]
Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]			[ch]E[/ch]
She put me right on my first mistake[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C#m[/ch]			  [ch]F#m[/ch]
Summer wasn't gone when I learned all she had to show[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]
She really gave all a boy could take[/tab]

So now when I get lonely, still looking for the one and only
That's when I wish I was lyin’ in the arms of Mary

Chorus

The lights shine down the valley, the wind blows up the alley
Oh and I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary
Lyin’ in the arms of Mary, Lyin’ in the arms of Mary
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lyin’ in the arms of Mary

[Verse 1]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
My ball and chain[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
She moves against the sea again[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F#m[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]
Silent and obscured, shallow and unsure[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
Shaboom, shaboom[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]
Her heart it goes[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
It raps against her chest again[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F#m[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]
Muddles out the pain, cast like wind and rain[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
She moves, she moves[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
My libido is sprung, and my heart, it did long[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
For your wondrous touch[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
But as night it drew on, I could hear the faint sound of a crowd[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]B[/ch]  N.C.
Hark! Their voices they sang:[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Go get Romeo, his Juliet is on her back[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Cmaj7[/ch]
And she is giving away, she's giving away, she's giving away[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Everything that they had[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]B7[/ch]
Oh, go get Romeo, his Juliet is on her back again[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
My ball and chain[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
She drove me to feel young again[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]              [ch]F#m[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]
Oh the way she moves, seduction through and through[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
Shaboom, shaboom[/tab]
[tab]N.C.            [ch]Am[/ch]
She stomped her boots[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
To the sound of an erotic aged guitar[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
And the sound of my heart came out in unison, but[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#m[/ch]                       [ch]B7[/ch]
Far away, they sang: she'll be back in his bed again[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Go get Romeo, his Juliet is on her back[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
And she is giving away, she's giving away, she's giving away[/tab]

Everything that they had[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Bm[/ch]  [ch]B7[/ch]
Go get Romeo, his Juliet is on her back again[/tab]

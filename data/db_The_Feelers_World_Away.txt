[tab][ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
I made faces in the window[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]        
And I believe now[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]              
I'm not living in the shadow[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]               
And I can see you now[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]          
I'm coming in on a roller coaster ride[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]                     
I feel alive yeah[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                                
I'm shattering your arm with your head with your face in the clouds[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]           
I believe now[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]           
I believe now[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                          [ch]G[/ch]          
When you said that you're never going back again[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]E[/ch]     
I was playing in the water[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]E7[/ch]                 
You were just another world away[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                          [ch]G[/ch]          
When you said that you're never going back again[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]E[/ch]     
I was playing in the water[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]E7[/ch]                 
You were just another world away[/tab]

And so on..


Just play along with the song to get the timing.
It's in four, so it shouldn't be too hard.

Well I died in penn station tonight, oh lord
Well I died in penn station tonight, oh lord
In penn station tonight

Oh how sweetly I do sleep
On the bathroom tile where the porters sweep
With a nickel in my hand
Like the star of Bethlehem, Oh Lord
Like the star of Bethlehem

And I know on track number seven
There's a train to take me to heaven, Lord
But a faster train's coming near
That the devil engineers, Oh Lord
That the devil engineers

(For the "Chatter" Section here just a C going)

Well I died in penn station tonight, Oh Lord
Well I died in penn station tonight, Oh Lord
In penn station tonight

And I know on track number seven
There's a train to take me to heaven, Lord
But a faster train's coming near
That the devil engineers, Oh Lord
That the devil engineers

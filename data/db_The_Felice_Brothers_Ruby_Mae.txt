For the accordion arpeggios, play Em as 333453… think of it as Dm moved up a whole step
And the chord played in the beginning is a Bbm

Capo 4

That Ruby Mae[/tab]

In the open window breeze
She pulled her stockings above her knees
Such a lovely girl was she
That Ruby Mae

Solo, same chords

On a lonely winter night
I followed her under Christmas lights
So low down was I
To Ruby Mae

Solo, same chords

In the bitter morning air
I hid her body there
In the heart of old Times Square
So she’d not lose her way

Her name was Ruby Mae
She danced the cabaret
Such a lovely girl was she...

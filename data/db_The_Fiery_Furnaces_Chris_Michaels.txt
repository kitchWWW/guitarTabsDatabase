Tabbed by: The Valrus
Email:     valrus@bluebottle.com

Tuning:    Standard

Notes:     TOOK... FOREVER.
           Divided into sections for your delectation, since this is about
           six songs in one.
           Most sections are verse-chorus-verse-chorus with identical chords
           for the two V-C pars; this is indicated in the tab. I included
           ALL the lyrics; email if you think I should remove the ones
           that don't actually have chords above them. That said, here we go:

[repeat above chords]
Well Tony took it all in stride
Said "don't be silly" but wondered who had spied
Jessica, driving down Wolf Road
Roll up the windows baby, talk in code.

I'm the little bird at your back door, said your true love's let you down.
I'm the little bird through your chimney, said that he's been runnin' round.
He's working up the courage so to leave you.
He's getting ready to say he don't love you.

On the top of a Naracan Dam
Started our picnic then Bam!
My Devi 'n me had to scram
Quick down to Madras aâ€™lamb
Thought as a tindal that I could blend
As I got to pretend
From laziness, the gang defend
Pick up your pick axe and rend!

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Pete was a lonely mongrel dog[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A7[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
who lived in central Wigan.[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
He had a great thought one winter's day[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
while out for bones a-digging :[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
He'd change his life and he'd change his ways[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]A7[/ch]
and a sailor-man he'd be,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
So he packed his tail and buried his bones[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
and off to sea went he.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Off to sea went, off to sea went,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]D7[/ch]
off to sea went he-e-e,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Off to sea went, off to sea went,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
off to sea went he.[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
He joined an English mon-o'-war[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A7[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
as first mate to the captain,[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
They travelled far to many lands[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A7[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
where the trees were tall and champion.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
He roamed the seas until he found[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]A7[/ch]
it wasn't what he'd dreamed:[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
There was no place to bury his bones[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A7[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
and his tail was a permanent green.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
He'd change his life and he'd change his ways[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]A7[/ch]
and a soldier he would be,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
So he buried his bones in the ocean deep[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
and off to war went he.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Off to war went, off to war went,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]D7[/ch]
off to war went he-e-e,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Off to war went, off to war went,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
off to war went he.[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
He joined the Royal Artillery[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A7[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
as mascot to the battery.[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Em[/ch]
Well he combed his hair and polished his tail[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
and did things very exactly.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Well they marched him up and down the square[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]A7[/ch]
and stood him to attention,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
But when he'd chased the cook-house cat-[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A7[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
they put him in detention.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
He'd change his life and he'd change his ways[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]A7[/ch]
and an airman he would be,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
So he swapped his guns for a set of wings[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A7[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
and off to fly went he.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Off to fly went, off to fly went,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]D7[/ch]
off to fly went he-e-e,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Off to fly went, off to fly went,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
off to fly went he.[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
He joined the Royal flying lads[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A7[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
as assistant navigator;[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Em[/ch]
At finding his way from here to there[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A7[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
there never was anyone greater.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
He flew through the air at incredible speeds[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]A7[/ch]
and sometimes upside-down,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A7[/ch]
And after a while he thought it was[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]
much safer on the ground.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
He'd change his life and he'd change his ways[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]A7[/ch]
and go back to his digging,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
So he packed his tail and left his bones[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A7[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
and sniffed his way to Wigan.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
He'd change his life and he'd change his ways[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]A7[/ch]
and he'd go back to his digging,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
And spend his days in simple ways:[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A7[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
With his tail â€˜neath the trees of Wigan[/tab]

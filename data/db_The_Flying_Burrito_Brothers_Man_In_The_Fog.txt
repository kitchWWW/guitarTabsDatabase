[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
She calls me the man in the fog[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Take me she says just one time[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]
Our seats our so close in the dark[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]A[/ch]
And this feeling's not mine[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]D[/ch]
I can't stop this feeling's not mine[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
I came by her place once before[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Thought I would go for a ride[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bb[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
I saw through the screen on the door how[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
Her old mama cried[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
She wouldn't let me inside[/tab]

SOLO

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
My daughter is in such a fog[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
She seems to be under a spell[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bb[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
It's all I can do just to keep you away if I can[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Soon as you're gone she'll be well[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
A note came along in the mail[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Be under my window at nine[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bb[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
I got up the money for bail[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Baby, everything's fine[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
We're gonna make it this time[/tab]

SOLO

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
We can get lost in the crowd[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Places we already know[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
Like all the parks[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
And the taverns where old people go[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
Waiting for winter's white snow[/tab]

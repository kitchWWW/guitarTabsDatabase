Artist: The Frames
Song: When Your Minds Made Up
Genre: 
Key: 


I'm not going to tab the picking. One, because I don't think Glen uses standard chords
this one. And two, I'm too lazy to figure out exactly what he's doing, but these chords
to work. So just employ your own picking pattern or strumming pattern. Do something 
and make the song your own, since songs like these are so emotional I don't think we
try and recreate it but rather mold it to yourself.

God Bless

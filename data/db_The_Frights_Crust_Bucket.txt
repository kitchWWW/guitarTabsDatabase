[tab]             After school                     messing around and you're so cool
             They dont know                   about all that shit we do
             I won't tell                     if you promise you won't too
             It's not so hard                 after all that we've been through (strum an E chord)

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]         [ch]C#[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]
   Waking up,      and it's hard to give a fuck[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]           [ch]C#[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]

Verse 2 (just bass)
I'm alone, and I got my family
And they wont stop asking when you leave
'Cuz they know, the drug's taking over me
And I can't overdose if you're not right there with me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
(just bass)
We don't know what we're doing to our heads
Every night when i'm laying in your bed
I get scared and I start to think of you
Is it true, do you think of me too?

[Chorus]

Bridge - back to 6/8, play the intro part
Now that you're gone, I think I know what i did wrong
Now I've moved on, I think I know what i did wrong
Now that you're gone, I think I know what i did wrong
Now that you're gone, now that you're gone
oh oh     (strum an E chord right here)

[ch]D[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]

[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
When you said you loved me, did you really love me [/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
or did the words just spill out like drool on my pillow?[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]
‘Cause I was naked when you said those words[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bb[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
But I felt covered in your whispered worship[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
And as you passed out fast on my shoulder,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
I imagined a child waiting so sad and still for his mom to arrive. [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
Did she leave you an orphan, in that big, brown leather chair? [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bb[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
Said, "Don’t you move a muscle, kid, I’ll be back in twenty years,"[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
You were scared, you were lonely, but you must’ve been aware;[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
Life is a series of calluses, this is just another layer. [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                                [ch]Bb[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
So, build ’em up, tough it out, yeah, that’s your skin – don’t let anyone under there.[/tab]

[ch]D[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]
[ch]D[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]

[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]Bm[/ch]
When you said you needed me, did you really need me[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Bb[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
or was it just someone, oh you’ll take anything[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]
Am I first on that list of yours, or am I second or third?[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Bb[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
So who’s that ahead of me, some harlot from Pittsburgh?[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Or Detroit, Santa Fe or San Diego[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
I know you’re so alone but how much affection does one guy really need?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
Did you date a lot in high school? Were you always chasing girls?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch]
Couldn’t you find some young valentine to steal your heart for good?[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
Were you content or contemptible? Are your memories pleasant?[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bb[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
Or is it a string of endless flings of bitter resentment?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]                                      [ch]Bb[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
Seems that what you want and what you need doesn’t mean a thing, we’re just here for the taking.[/tab]

[ch]D[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]
[ch]D[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]

[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]Bm[/ch]
When you said you’d hurt me, did you think you’d hurt me?[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
Are you really that cocky, yeah what a heartbreaker[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
Well I got my armor, yeah I’ve been through some battles before[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Bb[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
And I met your old girlfriend, she said baby don’t bother[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
She told me you told her you’d hurt her[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
Funny, how familiar, so how much of this relationship was rehearsed?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
Did you act out as a child? Were you always crying wolf?[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bb[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]
Attention starved, you tried too hard, just to get someone to look[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
Now you’re a wolf in second hand clothing, I’m a sheep in a pleated skirt[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
It’s an awkward form of payback, but if it works for you it works.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]                                     [ch]Bb[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
It’s that I recognize your off-white lies, still I lie beside you, and that’s what really hurts.[/tab]

[ch]D[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]
[ch]D[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]

[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]Bm[/ch]
When you said you’d leave me, why haven’t you left me?[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Bb[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
What are we still doing here, so desperate for company?[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
There’s a Greyhound on Jackson Street, there’s an airport in Council Bluffs[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Bb[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
Hell, there’s a car in the driveway. Fifty ways to get lost.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
But as I hold you and listen to you sleeping[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]                         [ch]Bb[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
I’m starting to wonder if I really believe that you’ll ever really leave.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
Would you leave me an orphan in your big brown leather chair?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
The one you lugged around from town to town for all these years.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
It’s a trophy of your childhood, like a shark tooth or gator skin boots[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
But this one holds you prisoner. It holds me prisoner too.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                    [ch]Bb[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
What we need to set us free is to let go of each other, let go of everything.[/tab]

[ch]D[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]
[ch]D[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]

[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]Bm[/ch]
When I said I loved you, it was because I loved you.[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bb[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
When I said I needed you, well, I really need you.[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]Bm[/ch]
Yeah, I guess you hurt me, for once you’re a man of your words.[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Bb[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
Well, guess what – I’m leaving – I can’t be your prisoner.[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
I can't be your prisoner - oh no (x12)[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                                             [ch]C/G[/ch]
	Was it bitter then,with our backs against the wall[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                                        [ch]C/G[/ch]
	Were we better men,then we'd ever been before[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                                                         [ch]C/G[/ch]
	Say if she came again today,would you still answer to the call[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                                           [ch]C/G[/ch]
	Tell the truth my friend,don't it matter anymore[/tab]


Verse 1:
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                                           [ch]C/G[/ch]
	We were simple men,by her side when she was born[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                                            [ch]C/G[/ch]
	It was simple then,like the freedom when you fall[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                                                         [ch]C/G[/ch]
	We were smaller then you see,but soon we gathered like a storm[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                                              [ch]C/G[/ch]
	They don't understand what that thunder meant at all[/tab]


Verse 2:
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                                      [ch]C/G[/ch]
	Was he crucified,was he done in by the law[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                                        [ch]C/G[/ch]
	Are you satisfied that he'll never ride again[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                                                    [ch]C/G[/ch]
	Some people say he got away,they say he never died at all[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                                           [ch]C/G[/ch]
	If that story's true,does it bother you my friend[/tab]

[Intro] (x2)
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                    
Well we've all heard tales about Little Johnny,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
Gets in trouble at school, filthy little mouth,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
He called the teacher a tool, during design and technology[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch] 
But during science, the teacher he respected,[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
broke down his defiance with a subject unexpected,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Of what would be, when massive chunks of ice fall in the sea[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And Johnny comes in from school and says "Mum, [/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
there's a star on fire in the sky,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
And it scares me I don't know why",[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Little Johnny's got tears in his eyes and his mum says,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
"Calm down son, we don't want anymore of them floods in here,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Remember last year when we nearly lost the house,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
And the mouse that ran around the kitchen drowned"[/tab]

[Instrumental] (x2)
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
So look here now, Little Johnny's on a mission,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Down to Parliament, by his own admission,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
It's an argument he expects and he's gonna let his anger flow[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
So Johnny starts a talk to the MPs and the speaker,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
'Bout his worries for the Earth but they're lost in the ether,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
Johnny ain't daft so he leaves and he whacks up the thermostat[/tab]

[Middle9]
[tab]   [ch]Bm[/ch]                       
He locks them inside, they can hardly breathe,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
Now Little Johnny's outside, the MPs are on fire,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                                             [ch]D[/ch]
So Johnny gets his dad along with the rest of the fire brigade[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Bm[/ch]
"Aim for the windows" Little Johnny gave a cry,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
The water flooded in and all in favour shouted aye,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch] 
But none of them were sailors,[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
And were scared of choppy seas and catastrophes[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
There's a star on fire in the sky,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
And it scares me I don't know why,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Little Johnny's got tears in his eyes and his mum says,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
"Calm down son, we don't want anymore of them floods in here,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Remember last year when we nearly lost the house,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
And the mouse that ran around the kitchen drowned"[/tab]

[Instrumental] (x2)
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
So off went the water and down came the heat,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
All the way down to an ice age degree,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
And Johnny shouted out, 'I'll turn the key if you can all agree'[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
So in comes Johnny, not so little now,[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]
Back at my school, I think this is how,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
to teach us a lesson, a practical session for us all to see[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
Cause there's a star on fire in the sky,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
And it scares me I don't know why,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Little Johnny's got tears in his eyes and his mum says,[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
"Calm down son, we don't want anymore of them floods in here,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Remember last year when we nearly lost the house,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
And the mouse that ran around the kitchen drowned"[/tab]

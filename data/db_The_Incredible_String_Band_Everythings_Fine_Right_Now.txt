[tab][ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
Who's that knocking on my door?[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
Can't see no-one right now.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
Got my baby here by me,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]A7[/ch]
can't stop, no, no, not now....Oh...[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
... Come a little closer to my breast,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'll tell you that you're the one I really love the best,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]F#[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]A7[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
'cause everything's fine right now.[/tab]

And you don't have to talk and you don't have to sing,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
You don't have to do nothing at all;[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
Just lie a-round and do as you please[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]
you don't have far to fall... Oh...[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
... Come a little closer to my breast,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'll tell you that you're the one I really love the best,[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Oh, my, my, it looks kind of dark.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
Looks like the night's rolled on.[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
Best thing you do is just lie here by me,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]
of course only just until the dawn... Oh...[/tab]

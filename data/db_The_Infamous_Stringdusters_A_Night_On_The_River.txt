I don't know where the money's gone, or where it's gonna be[/tab]

Not much to show for the work that I've done, but what else do I need[/tab]

[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
a night on the river is all I Need[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]               [ch]C#m[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]
A cool drink of water is all I need[/tab]

The bottom of the barrel
I know I've had my share
Tastes like it always does
No surprises there

Chorus

When I think about old times
I laugh so hard I cry
Got turned around along the line
But I still enjoy the ride

Chorus

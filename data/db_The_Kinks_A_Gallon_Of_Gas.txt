[Intro riff] 
[ch]G[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]    
I've been waiting for years to buy a brand new cadillac[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
But now that I've got one I want to send it right back[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                             [ch]G[/ch]
I can't afford the gas to fill my luxury limousine[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
But even if I had the dough no one's got no gasoline[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                      
I went to my local dealer to see if he could set me straight[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He said there's a little gas going but I'd have to wait[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]                                        [ch]C[/ch]
But he offered some red hot speed and some really high grade hash[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
But a gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere for any amount of cash[/tab]

[Pre-chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I can score you some coke and some grade one grass[/tab]

But I can't get a gallon of gas
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
I've got some downers some speed all the drugs that you need[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
But I can't get a gallon of gas[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
There's no more left to buy or sell[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
There's no more oil left in the well[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
A gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
For any amount of cash[/tab]

[Pre-chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Who needs a car and a seven-forty-seven[/tab]

When you can't buy a gallon of gas
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Who needs a highway, an airport or a jet[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
When you can't get a gallon of gas[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
There's no more left to buy or sell[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
There's no more oil left in the well[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
A gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
For any amount of cash[/tab]

You can't buy a gallon of gas

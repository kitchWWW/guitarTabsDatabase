Excuse me Mr Manager, Can I have a word?[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
I need to tell you something, I don't know if you've heard (you see)[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
You've always told me what to do, At this company but[/tab]

But now I've thought of summat, That you can do for ME[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
You can stick your job, thats what you can do[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
You can whistle if you think I'm doing any more for you[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
You made my life a misery, I've had to draw the line[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
So take your job and stick it,  Where the sun don't shine[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
I'm walking out, resigning, With immediate effect[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
If you want this in a letter, I can do that with ease[/tab]

In fact I'll give you two letters, As I flick you the Vs[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
You can stick your job, thats what you can do[/tab]

You made my life a misery, I've had to draw the line[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
I'm sorry if me walking out, It puts you in a panic[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                   [ch]E[/ch]
But working here's like rearranging, Deck chairs on't Titanic[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
This company is clueless, The management's a farce[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
You lot couldn't tell your personnel, From your HRs[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
You can stick your job, thats what you can do[/tab]

You can whistle if you think I'm doing any more for you[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
You made my life a misery, I've had to draw the line[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
So take your job and stick it,  Where the sun don't shine[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
Here's some advice, if you treat people, Like they're nowt but scum[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]E[/ch]
Eventually you'll find they'll turn and Bite you on the bum[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
(But) before I go I must confess and solve a mystery[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
That phantom naughty scribbler, In the toilets, that was me[/tab]

You made my life a misery, I've had to draw the line[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                        [ch]F#[/ch]                   [ch]B[/ch]

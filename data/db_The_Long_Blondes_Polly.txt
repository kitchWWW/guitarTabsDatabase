Polly, I know just where you been[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]

And I think that you should stop it right away[/tab]
Polly, I don't want you to think 
I'm completely in the dark
As to why you don't come round here anymore
Polly, I could stop this right away
I could tell you not to stay
But you'd never listen to anything that I would say

That you don't know what's wrong with me[/tab]


I kissed you in the shower
I kissed you in the park
If you didn't like me
Why did you let it get this far?
You gave me half of what I gave
You cut a sway through every girl
You gave me half of what I gave
You cut a sway through every girl

Clouds like sillouhetts[/tab]
That cold wind on my neck

Find a light burning through the haze[/tab]

[Verse 3]
N.C. (or do what you did before)
I don't got any plans
Who needs him?
Looks like tonight I'll be scrolling through my phone
I might go catch a flick
Or drive past the bar just to look inside it

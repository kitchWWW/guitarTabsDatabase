[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]                                   
The girls are crying on the corner[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Because the boys all left and they've had too much to drink[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
We're in London, mid October[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
He's convinced the blonde by the bar just gave him a wink[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
And the words he spoke left me in disbelief[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
He said, "Smoke whatever you've got left,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
It's getting late and we don't have much to lose"[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
Well she said, "English girls they just like sex"[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
I couldn't believe when he said, "I've got news for you [/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
American boys do too."          (Ooh ooh)[/tab]
                                



[tab][ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
Pins her against the wall (Ah ah)[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]C[/ch]                                  
Tells her she's beautiful (Ah ah)[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]F[/ch]
She says she's going home that's when he said...[/tab]



 
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]
And that boy he is a drifter[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
Tomorrow he'll be far away[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]           
And the moment before he kissed her[/tab]

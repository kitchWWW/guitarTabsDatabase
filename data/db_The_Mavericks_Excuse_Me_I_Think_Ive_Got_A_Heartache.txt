[Verse 1]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
They just don't know how lost I feel without you[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]B7[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
My teardrops never see the light of day[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]A[/ch]
I laugh and joke each time they talk about you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B7[/ch]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it say[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
Excuse me I think I've got a heartache[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B7[/ch]
There's an aching deep inside[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]E[/ch]
And it just won't be denied[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]A[/ch]
Excuse me I think I've got a heartache[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B7[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
And I better say goodbye before I cry[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]                                      [ch]A[/ch]
I guess it's pride that makes me hide my sorrow[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]B7[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
I live a lie in all I do and say[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]A[/ch]
My lips may lie and paint a bright tomorrow[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B7[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]
But if I told the truth I'd have to say[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
Excuse me I think I've got a heartache[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B7[/ch]
There's an aching deep inside[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]E[/ch]
And it just won't be denied[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]A[/ch]
Excuse me I think I've got a heartache[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B7[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
And I better say goodbye before I cry[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B7[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
And I better say goodbye before I cry[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B7[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
And I better say goodbye before I cry[/tab]

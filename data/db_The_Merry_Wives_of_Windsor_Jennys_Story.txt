[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                         [ch]Gm[/ch]
When I was a young lass I met me strapping Jonny[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Eb[/ch]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
He was tall and he was handsome and I looked upon him fondly[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                          [ch]Gm[/ch]
He started his pursuing and soon we were a'courting.[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Eb[/ch]                        [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
And when springtime was'a fading a gold ring I was a'sporting[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]  [ch]Bb[/ch]                             [ch]Gm[/ch]
A year we were betrothed and the wedding plans were started[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Eb[/ch]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
Come hell or come high water I knew we would not be parted[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                           [ch]Gm[/ch]
But then we were'a married and I started a'grieving[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Eb[/ch]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
Because me handsome Johnny had turned to a life of thieving[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]     [ch]Bb[/ch]                        [ch]Gm[/ch]
He'd travel out for fortnights gathering up his booty[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Eb[/ch]                             [ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
But I stood beside me husband for it was me solemn duty[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                       [ch]Gm[/ch]
For years I was a'hoping his ways would be a'mended[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Eb[/ch]                          [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
That he would be an honest man before his life was ended[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]

[Verse 4]
[tab]    [ch]Bb[/ch]                            [ch]Gm[/ch]
One day the captain Farrell on my door he came a'rapping[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Eb[/ch]                               [ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
He said he'd kill my husband lest I did agree to trap him[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bb[/ch]                            [ch]Gm[/ch]
So I waited until midnight when my Johnny was a'sleeping[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Eb[/ch]                                   [ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
And I got up in my bed clothes through the house I was a'creeping[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]

[Verse 5]
[tab]  [ch]Bb[/ch]                            [ch]Gm[/ch]

[tab]      [ch]Eb[/ch]                            [ch]Bb[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
And I bid me Johnny farewell for me heart still called him lover[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bb[/ch]                          [ch]Gm[/ch]
They captured my poor Johnny and now he lies in prison[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Eb[/ch]                            [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
And he says my name in curses but at least me husbands living[/tab]

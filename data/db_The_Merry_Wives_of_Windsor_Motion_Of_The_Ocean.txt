While traveling through Spain I met a gallant captain[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
He liked to brag about his enormous galleon[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Despite her two anchors and her long mast of wood[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
His big, manly ship couldn't sail like it should[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
In every port the ship size is the notion[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
But here is the secret[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Of a girl's devotion[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
It's not the size of the ship[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
It's the motion of the ocean[/tab]

As I explored the East I met a man in China[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
Who swore his famous junk was goin' to thrill ya[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
Contrary to his promise it was not a great ride[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
The size of his rigging made all the girls swoon[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
The trip ended early when he came in port too soon[/tab]

[Chorus]

For a Dutch man I fell and in Holland I did go[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
He wanted to show me his impressive cargo[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Its size made me marvel so on his ship I rode[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]

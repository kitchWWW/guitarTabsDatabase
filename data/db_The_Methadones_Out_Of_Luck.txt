I never ever wanted to get to close to you [/tab]

[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
I didn't wanna fall in love [/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
They'd tell me all the stories of the boys and their glory [/tab]

[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
Nearly died when you gave them the shove [/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
But I fell for you honey, now I'm feeling funny [/tab]

[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
Like maybe I'm the next in line. [/tab]

[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]F#[/ch]

[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                      
Because you always told me that when we were together [/tab]

[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
you were happy for the very first time,[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                   
I'd look into your blue eyes and figured that you meant it [/tab]

[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
and that everybody else was lying. [/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]     
But now you come and tell me that you really like me [/tab]

[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
and you hope that we can still be friends, [/tab]

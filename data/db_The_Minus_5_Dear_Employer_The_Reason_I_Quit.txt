[[ch]E[/ch]] Dear employer [[ch]B[/ch]] I'd like to tell you
[[ch]F#m[/ch]] it's been wonderful [[ch]A[/ch]] for all these years
[[ch]E[/ch]] But now you know [[ch]B[/ch]] I've got a new shoe
[[ch]F#m[/ch]] and I'll be wearing it so [[ch]A[/ch]] far from here

[[ch]E[/ch]] Dear employer [[ch]B[/ch]] your escalators
[[ch]F#m[/ch]] are very dangerous [[ch]A[/ch]] on the way down
[[ch]E[/ch]] They rip the skin [[ch]B[/ch]] and they pull you in
[[ch]F#m[/ch]] spit out the boney bits [[ch]A[/ch]] and coffee grounds

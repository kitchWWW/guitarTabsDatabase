Modern Lovers - Someone I Care About

Here is another tab/chord chart for a song from the 
Modern Lovers' 1976 album, *The Modern Lovers.* 
I would be extremely interested in hearing from 
anybody with corrections, comments, etc.

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Well I don't want just a girl to fool around with[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Well I don't want just a girl to ball alright[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
What I want is a girl that I care about[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
Or I want nothing at all.[/tab]

Alright
 (and so on . . . )


Well I won't pretend I like a girl if I really don't
And act like she's great when she makes me feel appalled
All I want is a girl that I care about
Or I want nothing at all.
Well I don't want some cocaine sniffing triumph in the bar
Well I don't want a triumph in the car
I don't want to make a rich girl crawl
What I want is a girl that I care about
Or I want no one at all
Alright, listen to this now.

Picture this:
I'm walking with my girlfriend
28 misguided souls combined say, "We're moving in"
There's a certain kind of girl that you care about so much
You say, "I don't care what you guys do to me, but her, DON'T TOUCH!"

'Cause I don't want just a girl to fool around with
I don't want just a girl to ball
What I want is a girl that I care about 
Or I want nothing at all
Oh alright

Well I don't want a girl to fool around with no
I don't want just a girl to ball no
What I want is a girl that I care about
Or I want nothing at all.

Alright gentlemen.

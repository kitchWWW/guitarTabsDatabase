Sweet Little Lisa

NOTE: There's a spot in the third verse where I can't figure out the lyrics, and I
couldn't find them anywhere on the Internet.   Please, if you think you know
what they are, tell me!

[Verse]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Well the work whistle blew at a half past five o'clock[/tab]
[tab]                                                           [ch]D[/ch]
I saw the red light on the corner but man I never tried to stop[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
I got pulled over by a man in blue, he said now whatcha think you're tryin' to do[/tab]
[tab]                                                   [ch]A[/ch]
I told him 'bout my baby and he let me go thanks a lot[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I got invited to a party at a high class Hollywood pool[/tab]
[tab]                                                [ch]D[/ch]
There were womens all around and man I began to drool[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]E[/ch]
But with the evidence at hand, I said girls you got to understand[/tab]
[tab]                                                   [ch]A[/ch]
Since I met my baby I've been livin' by the golden rule[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Ain't nobody gonna make me shout[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Ain't nobody gonna put me out[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                                 [ch]A[/ch]
Ain't nobody make me do like my sweet little Lisa does[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Ain't nobody gonna make me sing[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
Or make me do the wrong damn thing[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                                               [ch]A[/ch]
Sinkin' my head in a cold cold stream like my sweet little Lisa do[/tab]

She was playin' with her gearshift I was playin' kinda nonchalant[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
She said she'd take me up to her room, and keep me ?????[/tab]
[tab]                                                    [ch]A[/ch]
I got a sweet sugar mama gonna give me everything I want[/tab]

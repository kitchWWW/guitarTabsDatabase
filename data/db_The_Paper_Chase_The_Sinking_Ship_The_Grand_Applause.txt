[ch]C[/ch]                                                 [ch]Am[/ch]

Grandfather burned up to ash and returned to the earth which spawned

        [ch]G[/ch]                                                   [ch]C[/ch]

This nefarious prank thatâ€™s controlled by the length of his arms

                                                      [ch]Am[/ch]

And the kindred is gathered by coffin and chaplain on his behalf

          [ch]G[/ch]                                                      [ch]C[/ch]

And a discreet tender man clears his throat, waves his hand following a laugh

 [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]

       And the band plays on



Repeat through all verses.

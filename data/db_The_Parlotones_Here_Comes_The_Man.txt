im on a black burn coming down break the ties that bind us wear a golden crown[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
cause im on a cloud im gonna fall for you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
ive beaten my chest with all the biggest flame of passion burns me[/tab]

here comes a man holds out his hand his looking strangely at me[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]

Artist: The Philosopher Kings
Song: Castles In The Sand
Genre: 
Key: 


This is my first chord writing. Pretty close to the recording.
The D-X mark is meaning that the X stops the strings (hitting the strings once) for a 
beat before going back into the G. It's kind of a quick 3 strum on the G & D. (G G G D D D X)

NO CAPO!

[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
Built a perfect house in a perfect town[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
Dreamt a perfect dream and it all fell down[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
We held on tight like hungry lovers[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Watched the day break from beneath the covers[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Had to know for sure what it's all about[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
Oh, this should be easy[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
Oh, just tell me we're happy[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
Just building castles in the sand[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] - X x3
(da da na na, da da na na)[/tab]


I saw the naked light and it burned my eyes
Couldn't look away, no matter how I tried
I watched you explode when you think it's over
Burst in colour like a super nova
Had to track you down, had to find you out

Oh, this should be easy
Oh, just tell me we're happy

Just building castles in the sand
[tab][ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] - X x3
Just building castles in the sand[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
The tides roll in and waves get closer[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
And knock us over and we get stronger every time[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
We build our castles in the sand[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Built a perfect house in a perfect town[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]

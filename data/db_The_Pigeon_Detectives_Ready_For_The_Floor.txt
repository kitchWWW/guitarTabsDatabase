Artist: The Pigeon Detectives
Song: Ready For The Floor
Genre: 
Key: 


By: Alex Campbell

Right, someone else did all the hard work trying to get the Hot Chip
original tabbed- I've just changed a few chords to be the way the Pigeon
Dectectives played it on Radio One's Live Lounge. I think it's a great
version and sounds better than what was up before (although that could be
closer to the Hot Chip chords)

TUNE 1/2 STEP DOWN IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ALONG WITH THE BBC LIVE LOUNGE CD

They use 2 guitars I think, one playing open versions of the chords, the
other playing bar versions of every chord. I've done my best to arrange for
1 guitar.

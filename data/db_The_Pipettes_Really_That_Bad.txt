VERSE 1


[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                [ch]B[/ch]        [ch]Ab[/ch]
He's the boy that always sits at the back of the class[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]
He never does what he's told (oh no he never does)[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
They say he's several years older[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]F#[/ch]
Than the rest of us[/tab]

[tab]                          [ch]B[/ch]   
Who wanna know if that is true (Oh yes, you better believe it)[/tab]



[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                          [ch]B[/ch]           [ch]Ab[/ch]
I once set next to him in geography when he was thrown out of his class[/tab]


[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
He's got a tattoo on his arm (I wonder where else)[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
They say he'll only come to harm[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]F#[/ch]                            [ch]B[/ch]
But I can see that he has got a certain charm[/tab]


But what's beneath his smile

[tab][ch]B[/ch]
But what's beneath his smile[/tab]

[tab][ch]B[/ch]
But what's beneath his smile[/tab]

[ch]B[/ch] - [ch]A[/ch] - [ch]Ab[/ch] - [ch]F#[/ch]


CHORUS


[tab][ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
He's good enough to smile at me [/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
When he passes me in the corridor[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
He's good enough to know my name [/tab]

[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]
Coz I heard him once[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
Can he really be that bad?[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Can he be that bad?[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Can he really, really, really be that bad?[/tab]

He's the boy who always stands by the bikes smoking on his own[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
And he once offered me a try (Oh, did you really? Did you try?)[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]F#[/ch]                            
But I was always too shy though I regret in now (Just to be near him for a while)[/tab]


[tab][ch]B[/ch]
I doubt he needs much longer.[/tab]

[tab][ch]B[/ch]
I doubt he needs much longer.[/tab]

[tab][ch]B[/ch]
I doubt he needs much longer.[/tab]

[ch]B[/ch] - [ch]A[/ch] - [ch]Ab[/ch] - [ch]F#[/ch]

Artist: The Ready Set
Song: Are We Happy Now
Genre: 
Key: 


Just got TRS new album and was looking for the chords for Are We Happy Now? (new
obsession) And I couldn't find any so I tried to play it myself (and failed). Took me a while
but this is the closest I could get to the song that didn't sound completely wrong, so.. 
hope you like my first tab? Feel free to correct all my mistakes. -Me:)

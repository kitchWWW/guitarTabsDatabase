Capo 4

[tab]verse [[ch]G[/ch], [ch]Cadd9[/ch]]
We welcome winter's wind[/tab]
The colors of our bones
will you collect me and compound
and clear your mind before the ground gets cold.
Embers in air, the wind in your hair
If you were a snowflake, and possibly I'd be the same shape as you.

[tab]pre chorus [[ch]G[/ch], [ch]Cadd9[/ch]]
Spilled coffee in the mornings[/tab]
You still adore me, and thats what I love about the cold nights
Cause your jacket fit me just my size.
[tab][[ch]G[/ch]]
Oh oh oh oh[/tab]

Chorus
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]       (?)    [ch]Dsus[/ch]
Baby love is like the holidays[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Cause everyones here and this is sincere(Check That!)[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]       (?)       [ch]Dsus[/ch]
List you made for Christmas Day[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Cause i'll be&#65279; on the rooftop, all night, giving out[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]Dsus[/ch]
Gifts to the world so every boy and girl can[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]                   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
feel the way that I do, everytime I see you.[/tab]

(same as first)
And it's these subtle things that make our spirits warm
And it's the comfort of carols sung, and ribbons hung, and Christmas lights on distant 
back road drives.
Embers in air.
You know it's hard being so far, and so far
It's a test of strength, but all it takes is the moments by your side.

Come morning when I wake up,
You fix your make up.
Lighting the fire up all night.
We'll drink hot chocolate and sing and sigh.

Baby love is like the holidays
Cause everyones here and this is sincere(Check That!)
List you made for Christmas Day
Cause i'll be&#65279; on the rooftop, all night, giving out
Gifts to the world so every boy and girl can
Move the way that I do, everytime I see you.

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I'm coming home to the Midwest[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]
Chasing down winter wonderland[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
You take your Pointsetta,[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Dsus[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
You tell me why it's better, being home right by your side[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
I'm driving home, but the ice storm is making this[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bm[/ch]
a test of strength and time[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Dsus[/ch]
Miracles real tonight, the feelings right, the decorations falling in place.[/tab]

Oh love is like the holidays
Cause everyones here
And this is sincere(Check That!)
List you made for Christmas Day
Cause i'll be&#65279; on the rooftop, all night, giving out
Gifts to the world so every boy and girl can
Feel the way that I do everytime I see you.

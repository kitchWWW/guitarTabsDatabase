Genre: 
Key: 


She’s a Hollywood  
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch] 
dream[/tab]
Straight from an A-list movie scene
Livin’ the camera life
 
Oh, she is the queen of  
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch] 
the rodeo drive[/tab]
I am a middle west boy

 
Straight from a small town with a  
[tab][ch]E[/ch] 
voice[/tab]
Screaming "I want her with me"
 
She could  
[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
be the hills to my beverly, my beverly[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch] 
She’s a beautiful ray, a socialite[/tab]
 
A paparazzi flash  
[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
on a Friday night[/tab]
She’s got me talking kinda fast like I’m on the fly
 
I  
[tab][ch]E[/ch] 
gotta get her here, oh-oh oh-oh[/tab]
On the front of magazines the world over

I’m looking at her pretty face at every turn
Lovin’ the way she drives a range rover
She’s independent, oh-oh oh-oh
Ce-ele-ebrity, come and be with me

Ce-ele-ebrity, come and be with me
Cuz
I really think you might like my style
Take a break, get away for a while
 
Don’t  
[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
got a lot but I got a smile[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch] 
I’d like to show you[/tab]
 
She’s a Hollywood  
[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
dream[/tab]
Straight from an A-list movie scene
 
Livin’  
[tab][ch]E[/ch] 
the camera life[/tab]
 
Oh, she is the queen  
[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
of the rodeo drive[/tab]
 
I am a middle  
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch] 
west [/tab]
 
boy
 
Straight from a small town with a  
[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
voice[/tab]
Screaming "I want her with me"
 
She could be the  
[tab][ch]E[/ch] 
hills to my beverly, my beverly[/tab]
 
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch] 
What do I gotta do to be her everything?[/tab]
What do I gotta do to make her notice me?
Everybody knows her name
I wanna be worth more than fame
I’m staring out into the crowd
 
But I’m without the one thing  
[tab][ch]E[/ch] 
that I need right now[/tab]
So come be my good feeling
Ohh…
Ce-ele-ebrity, come and be with me

 
Ce-ele-ebrity, come and be with  
[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
me[/tab]
Cuz
I really think you might like my style
 
Take  
[tab][ch]E[/ch] 
a break, get away for a while[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
D-d-don’t know you but I  [/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch] 
know you drive me  [/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch] 
wild[/tab]
I’ve got designer dreams

She’s got designer shades
 
Can’t look away from her  
[tab][ch]F#[/ch] 
magnetic [/tab]
 
gaze
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch] 
Killing me slowly when[/tab]
Her lips are talking
 
When I untie my t-t-tongue I  
[tab][ch]E[/ch] 
swear I’ll say[/tab]
Pretty girl, pretty girl

[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
Would you trade L.A. to come into my  [/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch] 
world?[/tab]
Couldn’t ask for nothing more
 
City girl, tell me  
[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
could you fall in love with a…[/tab]
 
Middle west  
[tab][ch]E[/ch] 
boy[/tab]
 
Straight from a small town  
[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
with a voice[/tab]
 
Screaming "I want her with  
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch] 
me"[/tab]
 
She could be the hills to my beverly,  
[tab][ch]A[/ch] 
my [/tab]
 
beverly
She’s a Hollywood dream

 
My  
[tab][ch]E[/ch] 
beverly[/tab]
I want her with me
My beverly

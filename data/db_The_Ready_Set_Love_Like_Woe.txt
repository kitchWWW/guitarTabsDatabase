I call this the "girl version" because I changed all the "Shes and Hers" to "Hes 
and Hims" just to make it easier for girls to sing it. I play this with CAPO ON 
4TH but you dont have to especally if you have a deeper voice(:

[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
I'm thinking, baby, you and I are undeniable[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
But I'm finding out loves unreliable[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I'm giving all I got to make you stay[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
Or am I just a roadblock in your way?[/tab]
              


[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Cause you're a pretty little windstorm on the boulevard[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Something like a Sunset, oh you're a shooting star[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
And I might drive myself insane[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
If those lips aren't speakin my name[/tab]




[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Cause I got some intuition,[/tab]

or maybe Im superstitious
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
that Im swallowing down[/tab]

To counter this addiction
[tab]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
you've got me on a mission[/tab]
[tab]                                                  [ch]D[/ch]
Tell me darling, can I get a break somehow?[/tab]

Could I say no?




Chorus
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Hes got a love like woe[/tab]

(whoaa oh oh oh)
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Boys got a love like woe[/tab]

(whoaa oh oh oh)
[tab]          [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I kinda feel like it dont make sense[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
Because you're bringing me in[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
and now you're kicking me out again[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Loved so strong, then you moved on[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Now I'm hung up in suspense,[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
Because you're bringing me in[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
And then you're kicking me out again[/tab]


          

[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
Its like a hurricane, speed train, hes a moving car[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Catch him in the fast lane, oh I gotta know,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Can I keep up with his pace?[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Kick it into gear when I see that face[/tab]
          


[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
You can take up all my time cause you're the only one[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
That can make a storm cloud break[/tab]

Pulling out the sun
[tab]      [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
And I cant get caught in the rain[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Can I get your lips to speak my name?[/tab]




[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Cause I got some intuition,[/tab]

or maybe Im superstitious
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]

Cause we only have one life[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
The timing and the moment,[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
All seem so right[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Cadd9[/ch]

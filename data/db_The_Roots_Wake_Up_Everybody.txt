Song: Wake Up Everybody
Artist: The Roots
(This song isn't easy for the reason that it uses ALL bar chords, but 
it is great for learning your 7th chord shapes. Tabs are also written out at the bottom)

[ch]D#m7[/ch] - [ch]G#m7[/ch] (repeatedly)

[Verse]
([ch]D#m7[/ch] - [ch]G#m7[/ch])

Wake up everybody

[tab]([ch]D#m7[/ch] - [ch]G#m7[/ch])
'Cause they're the ones who's coming up[/tab]

[Verse 2]
(same chords and structure)

Wake up, all the doctors
Make the old people well
They're the ones who suffer
And who catch all the hell
But they don't have so very long
Before the Judgment Day
So wont'cha make them happy
Before they pass away

Wake up, all the builders
Time to build a new land
I know we can do it
If we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do
Is put it in our mind
Surely things will work out
They do it every time

[Chorus]
(same as before)

The world won't get no better
If we just let it be, na, na, na
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah
Just you and me

[Rap solo]
[ch]D#m7[/ch] - [ch]G#m7[/ch] (progression for the rest of the song)

It's the God hour, the morning I wake up
Just for the breath of life I thank my maker
My mom say I come from hustlers and shakers
My mind builded on skyscrapers and acres
He said take us back to where we belong
I try to write a song as sweet as the Psalms
Though I am the type to bear arms and wear my heart on my sleeve
Even when I fell in God I believe
We the days at
Weave through the maze and the season so amazing
Feed them and raise them
Seasons are agin'
Earthquakes, wars and rumors
I want us to get by but we more then consumers
We more than shooters
More than looters,
Created in his image,
So God live through us,
And even in his generation living through computers
On love, love, love can reboot us

[Vamp/Outro]
Wake up, everybody
Wake up, everybody
Need a little help, y'all
Yes I do, need a little help
Need a little help, y'all ay
Wake up everybody
Wake up everybody
Wake up everybody

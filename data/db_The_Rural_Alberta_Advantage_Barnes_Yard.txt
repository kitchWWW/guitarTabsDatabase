[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Oh let's lie down for another night[/tab]
I'll hold you close under these skies
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Your brother's in the basement doing hot knives[/tab]
Your brother's in the basement doing hot knives
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
We struggle to tear ourselves apart in the night[/tab]
We struggle to tear ourselves apart in the light
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
Your father's on his way back home from site[/tab]
Your mother's in the kitchen batting her eyelash
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]
She would never want to be the one to despise[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
And our heartbeats stop as we plunge through the ice[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
We're broken down lovers at the side of the road[/tab]
We're broken down lovers in the city of oil
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
There's nothing going wrong in your empty home[/tab]
There's nothing going wrong and we'll leave it alone
[tab]       [ch]Bb[/ch]
Let's slip under the covers just to save our lives[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
And our heartbeats stop as we plunge through the ice[/tab]


[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Triple up your socks to dodge the frostbite[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]Dm[/ch]  
Cutting through Barnes' Yard hip deep in the night[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Rough and tumble lovers underneath the covers tonight[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]Dm[/ch]
I was holding onto you and you were holding me tight[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
Nothing's going wrong and nothing's ever going[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Oh let's lie down for another night[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]
I'll hold you close under these skies[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]
Your brother's in the basement doing hot knives[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]
Your brother's in the basement doing hot knives[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bb[/ch]                                         
We struggle to tear ourselves apart in the night[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
And there's nothing going wrong in the city tonight[/tab]

[ch]Dm[/ch] - [ch]Bb[/ch]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
Nothing's going wrong and there's nothing ever holding us down[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch] - [ch]Bb[/ch]
Oooooh ohh oh[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
Nothing's going wrong and no one's ever holding us down[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
Your parents, they say there's beautiful things in this old place[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
Your parents. they say there's beautiful things in this cold place[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                               [ch]Bb[/ch]
Now your parents say there's nothing for us in this old place[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
Don't leave me to stay and dream of how you're growing[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Oh let's lie down for another night[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]
I'll hold you close under these skies[/tab]

Your brother's in the basement doing hot knives[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]

We struggle to tear ourselves apart in the night[/tab]

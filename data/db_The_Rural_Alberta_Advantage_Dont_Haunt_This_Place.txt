[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
Don't haunt this heart, don't haunt this place[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]Em[/ch]
Your heart beating slow as it beats out of pace[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
West side apartment grows lonely and dark[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
West side apartment is two more empty hearts[/tab]

[tab]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
I see your keys hanging in the same place[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]Em[/ch]
They haven't moved for a month or even a day[/tab]
[tab]                                          [ch]C[/ch]
This was hard it was fun, we should do it again[/tab]
[tab]                                             [ch]G[/ch]
Give ourselves some time; ten years from the day[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
I need you now I need you then[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
I never want to feel this again[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Separate the room with painful divides[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]G[/ch]
Until there's nothing left to remind[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Never want to see you again[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
I never want to feel this again[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
Turn off the locks, all the pitfalls night[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Em[/ch]
'Til I find something you left behind[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
And the things we never had[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
And the things we wish would come back[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
Because we need this oh so bad[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
Because we need this oh so bad[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
And we tremble in the night[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
For the things we're wishing were right[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
Because we need this oh so bad[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Because I need you oh so bad[/tab]

Artist: The Rural Alberta Advantage
Song: Goodnight
Genre: 
Key: 


This is my first ever attempt at tabbing a song, but after seeing the RAA
live and having them finish their gig with this song.  I just had to learn 
how to play it for myself.  If you have any comments or corrections, pelase
post them.  I'd appreciate any fixes to my tab!

plug the radiator in the car[/tab]
[tab]						[ch]G[/ch]

[tab]					 [ch]Dm[/ch]
rushing to the woods where we first felt god[/tab]
[tab]						 [ch]C[/ch]
red quilled to our veins from the moment when we touched[/tab]

[tab]					       [ch]G[/ch]
the cities love is cold and the cities love is harsh[/tab]
[tab]						 [ch]Dm[/ch]
locked into our veins from the first September's frost[/tab]
[tab]					     [ch]C[/ch]
and someday if you get back together in your heart[/tab]
[tab]			 [ch]G[/ch]
maybe when can back back together[/tab]

January snap and the April winter thaw[/tab]

rushing to the woods where we first felt God[/tab]

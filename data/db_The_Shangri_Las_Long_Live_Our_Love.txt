Chorus 

But something’s come between us and its not another girl,
But a lot of people need you there is trouble in the world.

Spoken: Its the fighting that has come between us, and its
taken you far far away.
But please don’t wonder if Ill be faithful, you’re in my heart both night and day.
So, darling, I send my love to you, while you are fighting overseas,
And, I know one day, if we are lucky, God will send you back to me.

Chorus 

When Johnny comes marching home again, Hooray, Hurrah..
Please Lord, don’t let anything happen to him, Please I’m waiting for you Johnny, I’m waiting.

Chorus 2X

Sweet Sounds of Summer

Intro:  [ch]Gm[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]C7[/ch]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch] 
Once I’d wake up I reach out and take your hand[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]C7[/ch]   
The sky was our blanket, the pillow was the sand  [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]Dm[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Then on the beach that’s where we fell in love[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]C7[/ch]
The only one who shared our love were the bright stars up above[/tab]

Now all I have is this lonely room and winter’s come
The only sound that can be heard are my teardrops as they fall

Chorus:
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Bb[/ch]
(Remember) Sweet sounds of summer it drives too strongly[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]C[/ch]
Sweet ways are humming with a sigh[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bb[/ch] 
(Remember) Sweet sounds of summer wish I was (?)[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]C[/ch]
Our hearts were slowly way up high[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]Fm[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]          [ch]Fm[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]      
The sweet sound was caught, the quiet of our kiss [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Fm[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]Fm[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]
The quiet of our lips spelled to our fingertips [/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]Bm[/ch] 
And we were lost and in love (so very lost) [/tab]

Say life’s a game and it hurries by so fast
And if you find someone to love do your best to make it last
We were too young and the summers come and go
Until the time we meet again the memory lingers on

Chorus

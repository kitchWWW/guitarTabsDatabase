Artist: The Sheepdogs
Song: Jim Gordon
Genre: 
Key: 


Here is the basic chords for Jim Gordon by the Sheepdogs from their new album!  Sorry if 
the lyrics are a little off, there was none available on the internet so I had to do it 
by ear.  The timing of the song is a little wonky so play it with the version from the album and you
should be golden.

Whenever you play C, play the note on your middle finger (which would be E on your D or 
3rd string) and then play it open, play it again and play it open for a total of 4 notes.


Opening is 
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch], [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch], [ch]C[/ch] [ch]C/B[/ch], [ch]Dm[/ch], [ch]G[/ch], and then the first verse starts.

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
It's all over right now.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]

[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]DM[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
But my love is wrong, yeah. My love is wrong.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]             [ch]DM[/ch]     [ch]EM[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]Dm[/ch]
And they keep telling me it gets better and it won't be long.[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
My coat will fit you so well,[/tab]

A sadness only I can tell.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]C/B[/ch]     [ch]DM[/ch]

[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]DM[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]

Its only really two chords through the song; F#m to E, but the guitar organ throw in 
some variations occasionally, mostly F#m7 and an E chord with an added b note (when i play 
the barr chord with the A string  base note, i just take my pinky off to achieve the variation).

Through El Paso, you passed me up so long ago
It was a hard and calling road, I've been denied

Just when you know that
You know that your lies are talking
When you know that your lies are walking with the truth
And you were always looking
And I was always cooking up the proof

That's when you know that
When you know that your lies are talking
You know that your lies are walking with the truth
When you were always looking
And I was always cooking up the proof

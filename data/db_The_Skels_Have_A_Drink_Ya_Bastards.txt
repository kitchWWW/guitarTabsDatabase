If I had a dollar now for every drink I had [/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                                                      [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
I'd be so f*cking wealthy and things wouldn't be so bad [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                                         [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
but I drank down every penny in just seven drunken nights [/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                                       [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
and called out for another round of seven drunken pints [/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]F[/ch]
so have a drink ya bastards[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                      [ch]F[/ch]
Because is no time left to lose[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                      [ch]F[/ch]
It's nearly time for closing[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]F[/ch]
and we're running out of booze[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                            [ch]F[/ch]
So have a drink ya bastards[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                              [ch]F[/ch]
Because the morning' s nearly here[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                      [ch]F[/ch]
The open Road's before us[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                         [ch]F[/ch]
So let's have another beer[/tab]


If I could've found a girl could drink as much as me
I take her off to be my wife and live so happily 
but I've never known such girl to walk upon this land
I guess it's heaven's plan for me to be a single man

Chorus
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]
And sometimes well I lie awake at night I feel no pain[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]
This banging in my head, the stinging of the shame[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
I hear the angels calling me up on their lofty heights[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]G7[/ch]
But they don't sing a lullaby they sing me my last rites, sing me my last rights,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G7[/ch]
Sing me my last rights![/tab]


I've drunk me fill of piss and swill too many times to care
And sometimes when I stagger home I pass out on the stair
I like my women slightly large, my Whisky always neat
And sometimes in the summer I like to pass out in the street

Chorus

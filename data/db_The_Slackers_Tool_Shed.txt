[Intro]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Living in a tool shed[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Down by the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'm living in a tool shed[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Down by the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'm living in a tool shed[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Down by the river[/tab]
[ch]D[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I wasn't too concerned about what's going on[/tab]
There wasn't no warning 'til the break of dawn
I wasn't really ready for what's coming on
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
And I don't think I like it[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
It wasn't my fault, didn't start no war[/tab]
It wasn't my fault, economics poor
It wasn't nothing that I'm responsible for
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
And I don't think I like it[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
So I'm living in a tool shed[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Down by the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'm living in a tool shed[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And I think I kind of like it[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'm living in a tool shed[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Down by the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Living in a tool shed, down by the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You know, I kind of like it[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I wasn't gonna leave 'til a month ago[/tab]
I wasn't gonna quit 'til the boss said go
I wasn't so broke 'til I had no dough
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
And I don't think I like it[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I wasn't making trouble, wasn't outta line[/tab]
I paid my money, I stayed my time
It ain't my choice, I don't like do crime
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
But I don't think I like it[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And I'm living in a tool shed[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Down by the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'm living in a tool shed[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And I think I kind of like it[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'm living in a tool shed[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Down by the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Living in a tool shed, down by the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You know, I kind of like it[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
It ain't nothing that you take insurance on[/tab]
And after all the unemployment's gone
It ain't too long 'til you're moving on
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
And I don't think I like it[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You can't get attention with your wallet low[/tab]
You need a situation with the rent zero
You don't have to hear it from the landlord, though
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
So I think I like that[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And I'm living in a tool shed[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Down by the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'm living in a tool shed[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
And I think I kind of like it[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'm living in a tool shed[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Down by the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Living in a tool shed, down by the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You know, I kind of like it[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Living in a tool shed, down by the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You know, I kind of like it[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Living in a tool shed, down by the river[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You know, I kind of like it[/tab]

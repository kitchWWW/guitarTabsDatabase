Now and Then - The Smithereens

[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I've been torn apart since I met you, [/tab]
don't know how I'll see it through, 
troubled times are on their way, 
wish that you could stay
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Now and then, I feel like giving up, [/tab]
instead I'll cry, alone, and wonder why

[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Friends tell me I'm acting like a fool, [/tab]
the way we live breaks all the rules, 
the lies I tell don't seem so strange, 
wake me up, I'll change
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Now and then I feel like giving up, [/tab]
instead I'll cry, alone and just say goodbye

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Dsus4[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
Love, I can't believe my lies drove you away[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Dsus4[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
Love, I can't believe believe I made you feel this way[/tab]

[Verse 3]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Last time that I looked into your eyes, [/tab]
telling lies that made you cry, 
troubled times are on their way, 
wish that you could stay
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Now and then, I feel like giving up, [/tab]
instead I'll cry, alone and wonder why

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Dsus4[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]

Love, I can't believe believe I made you feel this way[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Dsus4[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]

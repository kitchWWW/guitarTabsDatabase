[Intro]
[ch]A[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]        
I am weak and I am selfish[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
You are but a guest in my heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]F#m[/ch]
Welcome for now, but soon must depart[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
You're a catherine wheel spinning its last[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]       
You'd speed past the hedgerows[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
I'd ask if it's okay if I smoke[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]F#m[/ch]
You'd say it doesn't bother you, and you'd smile as I spoke[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
You're a little child losing his hope[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]F#m[/ch]
And in the trappings of this silent snow[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]F#m[/ch]
That fell overnight and won't let me go[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, I know that the shame is mine[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
And the blame is my own to bear[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]    
Well I don't think and I don't feel[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
A cold chill doesn't break me yet[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]        [ch]F#m[/ch]
My chest is half empty, my mind a blank cassette[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]   
Tomorrow seems a dark distant threat[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
And if I knew what had pushed you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
So far from my heart or my mind[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]F#m[/ch]
Well would it give you comfort or strength of some kind[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Would it give you peace as I leave you behind?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]F#m[/ch]
And in the trappings of this silent snow[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]F#m[/ch]
That fell overnight and won't let me go[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, I know that the shame is mine[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
And the blame is my own to bear[/tab]

[Interlude]
[ch]C#m[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] 

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Oh I will never belong, belong to anyone[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Oh I will never belong, belong to anyone[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]F#m[/ch]
And in the trappings of this silent snow[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]F#m[/ch]
That fell overnight and won't let me go[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, I know that the shame is mine[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
And the blame is my own to bear[/tab]

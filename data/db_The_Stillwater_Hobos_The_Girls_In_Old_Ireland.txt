[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Well the Girls in Old Ireland they come to me [/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]A[/ch]
Bloody shillelagh clubs for to set me free [/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch] 
I said my lady’s fair won’t you listen to me [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
And I’ll bring you to your bonnie lass.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
In fifty-two the hunger took us by surprise [/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]A[/ch]
Water fell into my mother’s crying eyes [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bm[/ch] 
We wailed just like the doves in the morning cries [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
And the crops were sick in harvest time. [/tab]

[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
But my mother she was wise and she raised me well [/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]A[/ch]
She told me all the things that there was to tell [/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch] 
Precious you sure listen cause you need me now [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
In the years to come I won’t be there.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Just take a hard shillelagh in your hands so strong [/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]A[/ch]
Always hold it gently when they do you wrong [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch] 
But when you hear John Henry’s solemn hammer song [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
God give you strength like turpentine. [/tab]

[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And darling you’re a peach tree in the summer sun [/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
With bonnie little branches always on the run [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch] 
And when cold winds shake your branches like a crooked gun [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I’ll be there my cherub son.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
Like a mockingbird who laughs because there’s someone there [/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]A[/ch]
To wonder if they ever would discover where [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch] 
He's hiding in the trees without a worried care [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Streetcars in the alleyway. [/tab]

[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Well the Girls in Old Ireland they come to me [/tab]
[tab]                                          [ch]A[/ch]
Let their bloody kings and clubs be their melodies[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bm[/ch] 
A whiskey-fog still burning in my memory [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Scattered all along the grass.[/tab]

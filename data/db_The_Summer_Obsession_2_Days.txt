[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Dm[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
I stumble onto you, it's magical[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
This is the first time I have seen my soul[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Dm[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
And I'll wait       as long as it takes[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Dm[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]
But I don't want to wait 2 days[/tab]

(play the same chords for the rest of the song, except bridge)

I don't wanna wait 2 days to call
I wanna hear your voice right now or nothing at all
Cuz there's about a million ways that I can say
"I miss you", and I don't wanna wait 2 days

Where does it start, where does it end?
I'd fall apart without you, I can't pretend
That I'm happy here without you dear, I need you
And I don't wanna wait 2 days to call

I don't wanna wait 2 days to call
I wanna hear your voice right now or nothing at all
Cuz there's about a million ways that I can say
"I miss you", and I don't wanna wait 2 days

[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
And I can't wait[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Dm[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]
And there's not much else to say to you, to me[/tab]

Solo:
[ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]   (3x)

I don't wanna wait 2 days to call
I wanna hear your voice right now or nothing at all
Cuz there's about a million ways that I can say
"I miss you", and I don't wanna wait 2 days

I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, I can't wait 2 days

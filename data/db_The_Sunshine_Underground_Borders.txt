Song: Borders
Genre: 
Key: 


This sounds right to me:

A F#m D A played through the entire song

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]F#m[/ch]
Would you stop talking[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
Because I don't think we agree[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]F#m[/ch]
You're always keeping all your borders up[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                        [ch]A[/ch]
I'm thinking something must be wrong with me[/tab]


Repeat chord progression throughout the rest of the song.

Well I know you don't like it
You're no exclusive company
You're always keeping all your borders up
And it's a little more than you and me

Oh well I best say something
To stop us creeping 'round these avenues
You're always keeping all your borders up
I bet you're getting a little confused
(I don't think so)
Well it's time to turn this thing around
Well there's no reason for this thing you've found
You're always keeping all your borders up
I think it's time we tore them all down

[tab][ch]A[/ch]     [ch]F#m[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
Whoa, whoa, oooooh[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]     [ch]F#m[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
Whoa, whoa, oooooh[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]F#m[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
You gotta fight for a reason, what's your reason? You never cared.[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]F#m[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
You gotta fight for a reason, what's your reason? You never cared.[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]F#m[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
You gotta fight for a reason, what's your reason? You never cared.[/tab]


Oh what a shame

(and fade)

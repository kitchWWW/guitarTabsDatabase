[Verse 1]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Sink in, under the water and breathe deep[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
It's getting harder to stay afloat when you hang on[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
Slowly, slipping in farther and losing the battle we started[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
A silence sound envelops me[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
If I could have opened my eyes so I could see where I'd land[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
I would've never fallin' for you[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
There'd be no tears in my eyes, no beating in my chest[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
As drop by drop fills the sea[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Broken, crumbled to pieces and searching[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
For just one more reason to pull it together and just move on[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Miss the heat of the fire as your arms where holding me tight[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
And all the moments in between[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
If I could have opened my eyes so I could see where I'd land[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
I would've never fallin' for you[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
There'd be no tears in my eyes, no beating in my chest[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
As drop by drop fills the sea[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
I've been treading water and have poured out my soul[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Buried the pieces and let you go[/tab]


[Chorus]

If I could have opened my eyes so I could see where I'd land
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
I would've never fallin' for you[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
There'd be no tears in my eyes, no beating in my chest[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
As drop by drop fills the sea[/tab]


[Outro]

[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
Sink in, under the water and breathe deep[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
It's getting harder to stay afloat when you hang on[/tab]

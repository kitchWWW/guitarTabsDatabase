Gaslight, you better be cool or you'll wind up a fool like me[/tab]


There has got to be a way
To change that girl, you know how much I need her
She knows what she's got on me, 
And she knows, I can't bring myself to leave her

I'm walkin' around talkin' to myself
I don't know where I'm at, half the time 
I look at her picture, I see her face, 
I think of what she is, and I start cryin'

Chorus x 2


Chords used:
[ch]C#m[/ch]    x46654
[ch]C#m[/ch]/[ch]C[/ch]  x36654
[ch]E[/ch]      022100
[ch]F#[/ch]     244322
[ch]F#m[/ch]    244222
[ch]G#[/ch]     466544
[ch]A[/ch]      577655
[ch]C#m[/ch]*   x44454

At the end of the chorus there is a quickly alternating C#m / C#m* x4. 
You may want to try transposing up 3 semitones (start on Em) then the Em/D# is an easier 021000. 
Either way, using barre chords sounds cooler.

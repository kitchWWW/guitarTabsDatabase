Dear diary[/tab]
Want to make a new entry
[tab]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
Oh you wouldn't believe me[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
What began today[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
Well she called me[/tab]
Oh that girl from the party
[tab]                              [ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
And I thought she should be on TV[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]D[/ch]
When I first saw her face[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
She said alright[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]
What are you doing 'til daylight[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]
So I chanced it[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
I said dancing with you![/tab]

[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
She got legs like Beyoncé[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Give me the eye like Rihanna[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]
I wanna put her on camera[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause she drives me crazy, crazy, crazy[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Don't need no game show[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Or a Hollywood movie, pop video[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]A[/ch]
'Cause as long as she's next to me[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
I got all the girls on TV[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]A[/ch]
I got all the girls on TV[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]

Dear diary[/tab]
We finished dinner early
[tab]                    [ch]Bm[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
And the way that she kissed me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
Sent us on our way[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
And she danced like[/tab]
A professional all night
[tab]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
And the stars were her spotlight[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
The city became her stage[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
And I said so[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Can I buy a ticket to your show?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
She said front row[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
If I go home with you![/tab]

[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
She got legs like Beyoncé[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
  Like a star on a silver screen[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]
Oh I'm punching above my weight,[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
We're from different sides of the street.[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]G[/ch]
And I know, I know, I know[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Still a little mysterious[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]
Why she taking me seriously?[/tab]

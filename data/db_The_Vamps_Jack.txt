[Verse]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
Jack when we were younger we hung out[/tab]

We were inseparable
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
But now jack you stole my thunder[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Gb[/ch]
Like my girl became my nemesis[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]          [ch]Gb[/ch]
He might be Mr. popularity but[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]         [ch]Gb[/ch]                       [ch]Bbm[/ch]
I wouldn’t wanna change a thing about me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Gb[/ch]
Uh oh oh don’t take this as jealousy,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]          [ch]Ab[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Just cause you’re with him and not me[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He drinks Daniels at the bar,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Db[/ch]
Drives his daddy’s jaguar.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]Gb[/ch]    [ch]Db[/ch]
Rocking clothes with wills on the tag[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Gb[/ch]
Girl he’s all up on your face[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Db[/ch]
Wanna put him in his place[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]Db[/ch]
But right now I'd rather be Jack[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Gb[/ch]
Saying look can’t you see[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Db[/ch]
He’s a dick compared to me[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]Gb[/ch]         [ch]Db[/ch]
You should know he ain't really all that[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Gb[/ch]
I still need you in my world[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Db[/ch]
But he's got you as his girl[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]        [ch]Db[/ch]
And that's why I'd rather be Jack[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]
I can't delete his story,[/tab]

Wipe your smile from my memory,

And forget you ever crushed me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bbm[/ch]             [ch]Gb[/ch]
By sleeping with the enemy[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]               [ch]Gb[/ch]
   I think he's just another wannabe so[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]                 [ch]Gb[/ch]                  [ch]Bbm[/ch]
I wouldn't change a single thing about me[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Gb[/ch]                                   [ch]Bbm[/ch]
Oh Oh, you need to take this personally, cause[/tab]

You're with him and not me[/tab]

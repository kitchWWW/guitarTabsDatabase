[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Collecting dust inside that liquor store 'till you bought it for me[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch] N.C.
A decanter full of whiskey in the image of the King[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]
  The more I drank from it the less I saw of you[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
  That bottle's empty now and you and I are through[/tab]


[Riff]

[Verse 1]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
When you gave me the King of gifts[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
I didn't know what to say[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
Except a hundred and fifty dollars[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
Is an awful lot to pay[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
For a girl like you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]
who doesn't make much money, anyway[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
But you cared enough to put away[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
a little everyday[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
For that Elvis decanter, the one you gave to me[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
A fitting symbol of our love, an empty likeness of the King[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
Your love for me went out the day you took that last remaining drink,[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
From that Elvis decanter, the one you gave to me[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
They told me I should have saved it; it'd be worth something someday.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
But me, I couldn't wait, that King of Rock got lighter everyday.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
  Soon it was half empty and I was half as close to you.[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
And then I drank the rest, I should've guessed I drank our love in two.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, that Elvis decanter, the one you gave to me[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
A fitting symbol of our love, an empty likeness of the King[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
If I had filled it up or made it last would it have changed a thing?[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
Oh, that Elvis decanter, the one you gave to me[/tab]

Oh, that Elvis decanter, the one you gave to me.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
In the   name of Elvis, why did you have to leave?[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch] N.C. [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
When I   love you and I   need you desperately  tonight.[/tab]


[Riff]
[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]
[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]


[Chorus]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]F#m[/ch]                      [ch]G#m[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Children are lovely before they get ugly and learn to do bad stuff[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]F#m[/ch]                        [ch]G#m[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Flowers are pretty before they get shitty and rot and turn to dust[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]B[/ch]
I heard that life is a wheel and you can't make it stop[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#m[/ch]
If you try it'll flatten your head[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]B[/ch]
It's a circle of shit we're in the middle of it[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
But soon we'll all be dead[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]F#m[/ch]              [ch]G#m[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Like everybody else that ever lived before the things you make fall to the floor[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]F#m[/ch]                 [ch]G#m[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
And nobody knows how hard you tried it's been that way since the start of time[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]B[/ch]
There was a caveman that did some amazing things[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]
But nobody here gives a fuck[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]
And in a thousand years they'll feel the same[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]B[/ch]
Towards all the things you've done[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
So don't worry what might give you cancer[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G#m[/ch]
Or stay up nights just wanting answers[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]B[/ch] [Fill]
It's just a crap shoot, but it's mostly crap[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Things start off they're so terrific[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#m[/ch]
They'll fuck up it's scientific[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
Entropy, uncertainty won't yield to you, or you[/tab]


[ch]E[/ch] [ch]F#m[/ch] [ch]G#m[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]

Love at first sight on a beautiful night and a feeling is so divine[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]F#m[/ch]                              [ch]G#m[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Gets sucked down the toilet cause something will spoil it with the good times left behind you[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Don't try to figure out who's at fault[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Powerful forces abound[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]B[/ch]
Like a twig on a river in the universe[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]B[/ch]
Tomorrow you'll probably drown[/tab]

And all the things that matter most, disappear, here's a toast[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]F#m[/ch]       [ch]G#m[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
To erosion and corrosion, alzheimers and pain[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]

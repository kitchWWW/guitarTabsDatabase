[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Mom says, put on your Christmas best.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
Grandpa's coming down this year and it might be his last.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Why Mom? You say that every time.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
It seems that he's been dying ever since I was nine.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
I don't mean no disrespect because he's old and mean.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
But how come we invite him when he always makes a scene?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Tell me why does, he hit me with his cane?[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
And why should I get him a gift if he don't know my name?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
How come, he always calls me "Kate"[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
And forgets his dentures on his dinner plate?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
This could be Grandpa's last Christmas[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
That's what Mother said[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Grandpa's last Christmas[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
And soon he might be dead, so be nice[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Be nice to Grandpa[/tab]

[Solo]
[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  x4

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
What can I say to someone 300 years old?[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
When he seems so content staring at the jello mold[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Please Mom, let me go out and play[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
Or soon I will go deaf like him from hearing him complain[/tab]

[Break]
[ch]C[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
I know, his life's been long and hard[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
And he deserves some quiet peace in a nice graveyard[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Grandpa, I love you just the same[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
But I know you won't be happy 'til you drive us all insane[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
This could be Grandpa's last Christmas[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
That's what Mother said[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Grandpa's last Christmas[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
And soon he might be dead, so be nice[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Be nice to Grandpa[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Cause he's old and he smells[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
And he's gonna die soon[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Be nice to Grandpa[/tab]

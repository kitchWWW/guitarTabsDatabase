[Intro]

Uh, the reason I didn't get you anything this year is-is because...


[Verse 1]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
I don't believe in Santa Claus[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
His corporate image forced upon[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
The blinded spending masses[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
To enslave the lower classes[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
With obligatory gifts that serve[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
To cleanse the year of guilt and shame[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                          [ch]G[/ch]
One token gesture justifies the apathetic, hypnotized[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]               [ch]F#[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D#[/ch]
Leaving them to be Kris Kringle's slaves (Ooh)[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]
Buy! Buy! I won't do it![/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]D#[/ch]
The season's obligation has not my participation![/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]
Buy! Buy! I won't do it![/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]D#[/ch]
The money hungry mating call of corporate swine[/tab]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
'Cause it's only for the money![/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
And it's only for the money![/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
'Cause it's only for the money![/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
Now buy![/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
He monitors naughty and nice[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Big Brother is St. Nick[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                                               [ch]C[/ch]
Methodically his judgment made documented on his list[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                              [ch]C[/ch]
I don't believe in Santa Claus or his mystical facade[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
To teach the children wanton greed[/tab]

Their lust for gifts becomes a need
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
Brainwashed by the marketing[/tab]

And victims of the corporate scheme
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Material possessions becoming their obsessions[/tab]
[tab] [ch]B[/ch]
'Till human life has lost it's value[/tab]

And you blindly do just what they tell you

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I don't believe![/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch] (Scratch it like Crass)
His tactics of intimidation repress the minds of youth[/tab]

Using fear for generations -- his image hides the truth

He's just a puppet for the system; a glutton in a suit
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C#[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]
With yuletide propaganda and a bearded mask to boot![/tab]


[Outro]

Uh, that, and I couldn't find a place to park at the mall. Sorry

[tab]                  [ch]B[/ch]
Leave it up to me[/tab]
Before you sweat out the truth
[tab]                                       [ch]E[/ch]
And your shirt reeks of infidelity[/tab]
You were gone long enough to miss the scabs
[tab]        [ch]C#m[/ch]                [ch]F#[/ch]
But you watched as the scars formed[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G#m[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
And you stayed as they faded away[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C#m[/ch]
And you promised me, honestly[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                                     [ch]G#m[/ch]
Things would be different this time[/tab]


That's why I'm singin'
[tab]                                      [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]C#m[/ch]
Darlin' won't you lie to me tonight on the way home.[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G#m[/ch]                                              [ch]E[/ch]
Can't you just tell me all of those things that I want to hear.[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]
Whoa[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G#m[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
'Cause I keep on tryin', tryin', tryin' not to ask[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F#[/ch]                                [ch]G#m[/ch]
Every question in my sickened head but it's hard[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]B[/ch]                        [ch]C#m[/ch]                        [ch]F#[/ch]
And oh darlin', won't you take me in and use me up,[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G#m[/ch]
Let me drive myself home?[/tab]


[tab]          [ch]G#m[/ch]
If this wasn't a game before well[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C#m[/ch]
We're playin' one now![/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                                  [ch]C#m[/ch]
And I'm losing it, but what did you expect[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]F#[/ch]
When you said that you broke all the rules?[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G#m[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]
Tell me how did it feel?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#m[/ch]                                    [ch]F#[/ch]
Go on, paint me a picture, and I'll hang it[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]G#m[/ch]
Over holes punched in these walls![/tab]


[tab]                      [ch]B[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]C#m[/ch]

What did he do, baby, what did he take from you?[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C#m[/ch]                        [ch]C#[/ch]
What does your silence mean? Does it mean that he...[/tab]

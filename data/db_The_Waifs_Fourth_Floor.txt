Capo on 4
Intro:
[tab][ch]G[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
Verse 1:[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
On the fourth floor of a building[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
In a shallow window box,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
She’s digging in the soil with a silver spoon[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
With her hands inside of rubber gloves[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Panting seed, pulling out weed[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
The cycle of life is complete[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Who would have thought it in a city of stone?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
Four floors above the street.[/tab]

Chord Progression stays the same for the rest of the song…


I cannot tell what kind of flowers they are
I’m too far below on the street
But the colour they add to the building so drab
Is a warm splash of welcome relief
Yeah it’s something worthwhile for the sun to shine on
A reason to radiate heat
Yeah that small window box it puts a skip in my feet
Four floors above the street

Repeat chord progression once

And for every good seed she plants in the soil
There’s a dozen bad waiting to grow
To strangle the goodness she’s trying to nurture
And kill all the seeds that she’s sown
Every time you water the garden
You also water the weeds
A profound illustration of sin and temptation
Four floors above the street

Some people don’t understand why she does it
Some people ask for a reason
Maybe she just likes the feel of the soil
And keeping in tune with the seasons
Maybe she has so much pride in herself
Got to keep it all visually pleasing
A small paradise in a world of concrete
Four floors above the street.

(Repeat last two lines and then end on a G).

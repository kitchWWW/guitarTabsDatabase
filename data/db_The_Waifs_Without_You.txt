Verse 2
I feel energised like I was young
I have not felt this way since we began
I'm gonna re-evaluate my future plan
time to free myself of your demands

Chorus 2
There's no need to compromise
I'll do whatever I decide
No one there to spoil the view
Without you

Verse 3
I don't care if I never catch the sun
I don't care if the whole thing comes undone
coz every day to me is a surprise
I don't care if it leads to my demise

Chorus 3
No restrictions now I'm free
No black clouds hanging over me
Yes I think I like this view
Without you

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Db[/ch]                        [ch]Db[/ch]
Come, come with me to the old churchyard[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Db[/ch]                               [ch]Db[/ch]*        [ch]Db[/ch]
I so well know those paths 'neath the soft green sward[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Db[/ch]                       [ch]Db[/ch]
Friends slumber in there that we want to regard[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Db[/ch]                           [ch]Db[/ch]             [ch]Db[/ch]
We will trace out their names in the old churchyard[/tab]


[Refrain]
[tab]              [ch]Db[/ch]                         [ch]Db[/ch]
Mourn not for them, for their trials are o'er[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Gb[/ch]*            [ch]Db[/ch]
Why weep for those who will weep no more[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Gb[/ch]*            [ch]Db[/ch]                     [ch]Db[/ch]
For sweet is their sleep, though cold and hard[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Db[/ch]                  [ch]Db[/ch]
Their pillows may be in the old churchyard[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]  [ch]Db[/ch]                           [ch]Db[/ch]
I know that it's vain when our friends depart[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Db[/ch]                      [ch]Gb[/ch]
To breathe kind words to a broken heart[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Db[/ch]                   [ch]Db[/ch]
And I know that the joy of life is marred[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Db[/ch]                         [ch]Gb[/ch]        [ch]Db[/ch]*
When we follow lost friends to the old churchyard[/tab]


[Refrain]
[tab]    [ch]Db[/ch]                    [ch]Db[/ch]
But were I at rest 'neath yonder tree[/tab]
[tab][ch]Gb[/ch]*           [ch]Db[/ch]*       [ch]Db[/ch]
Why would you weep, my friends, for me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Gb[/ch]*       [ch]Db[/ch]*          [ch]Db[/ch]
I'm so weary, so wayworn, why would you retard[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Db[/ch]                  [ch]Gb[/ch]
The peace I seek in the old churchyard[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]             [ch]Ab[/ch]*         [ch]Db[/ch]*        [ch]Ab[/ch]*
Why weep for me, for I'm anxious to go[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Db[/ch]                     [ch]Gb[/ch]
To that haven of rest where no tears ever flow[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bbm[/ch]*        [ch]Ab[/ch]*            [ch]Db[/ch]*       [ch]Db[/ch]
And I fear not my fate when it's time to depart[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Db[/ch]*        [ch]Gb[/ch]        [ch]Db[/ch]
I will set with the sun in the old churchyard[/tab]


[Refrain]
[tab]              [ch]Db[/ch]                   [ch]Db[/ch]
I rest in the hope that one bright day[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Gb[/ch]*                 [ch]Db[/ch]
Sunshine will burst through these prisons of clay[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Gb[/ch]*           [ch]Db[/ch]                          [ch]Db[/ch]
The trumpets will sound in the hills near and far[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Db[/ch]*         [ch]Gb[/ch]        [ch]Db[/ch]
Will wake up the dead in the old churchyard[/tab]

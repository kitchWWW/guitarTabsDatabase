Deadlier Than the Male 
 
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]Am7[/ch]            [ch]Bm7[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]
She whispers oh such pretty lies, don't believe her[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]Am7[/ch]            [ch]Bm7[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
For when she looks into her eyes love just isn't there[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
Brother, beware, take care, my brother, take care[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A7[/ch]                                [ch]G#[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch] 
For the female of the species is deadlier than the male[/tab]

The smile that made a dream begin clouds your vision
It's just the shadow of a dream that you're living in
She never cared, beware, my brother, beware
For the female of the species is deadlier than the male

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Memories of kisses on a summer's day[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]D7[/ch]
That's all she left you when she went away, now, you pay![/tab]

By walking streets, you'll never know when the night comes
Sitting at places that you go hoping she'll be there
Brother, beware, take care, my brother, take care
For the female of the species is deadlier than the male

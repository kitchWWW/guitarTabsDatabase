Chorus:
[tab][ch]F[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]G7[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Here's to memory, old age and every[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Here's to the people who live in a shell[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]G7[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
Here's to memory, one more for every[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G7[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
One for the road where pedestrians dwell[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
So self-assured, complacent and bored[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Our hero opens a box on the shelf[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
Containing advice, so worldly and wise[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Welcomes his children to help themselves[/tab]

Chorus

He hasn't time for riddle or rhyme
Too busy fighting machines at the plant
He married young, his path is his pocket
Beginnings and endings escape from this end

Chorus

Baptized, materialized, no time to realise
Caught in the current and drown in the well
Went about fifty, stubborn and empty
Hands out the world for his children to sell

Chorus (2X)

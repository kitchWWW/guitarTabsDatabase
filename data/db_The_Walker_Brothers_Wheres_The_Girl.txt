Where's The Girl 
  
[tab][ch]B[/ch] (with [ch]Badd9[/ch])
  Where's the girl, [/tab]
[tab]							    [ch]A[/ch](with [ch]Aadd9[/ch])
The canary stopped singing the moment she walked out the door[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]B[/ch] (with [ch]Badd9[/ch])
Where's the girl,[/tab]
[tab] 					      [ch]A[/ch](with [ch]Aadd9[/ch])
The flowers are dying 'cos nobody cares any more[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]					 [ch]D#m[/ch]              [ch]C#m[/ch]
The canary and the poor lonely flowers miss her so very much[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]					   [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]F#m[/ch] (?)

There is one nylon stocking and I'm a leaving it there where it lies

most is the girl….[/tab]

Here's a dresser drawer that's filled with old hairpins, lipstick and Lord knows what
And here's a photograph taken last summer and a bottle of perfume bought
[tab]                [ch]B[/ch] (with [ch]Badd9[/ch])
But where's the girl…. Where's the girl…. Where's the girl… Oh I need the girl…[/tab]

Artist: The Wave Pictures
Song: January And December
Genre: 
Key: 


I recently found the Wave Pictures and love their music, this song especially. I decided 
to try and tab out the chords for it, its my first tab so go easy if its not perfect. The picking 
part is basically same as the chords with some hammer ons thrown in there. I also had to 
get the lyrics by ear from the song so they are probably incorrect, that first line especially. 
Enjoy :)

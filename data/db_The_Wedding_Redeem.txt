Band: The Wedding
Album: The Sound The Steel EP
Song: Redeem (Track 5)


This is probably my favorite song on The Sound The Steel EP by The Wedding.
It's absolutely beautiful, and it's really easy. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
This song was written for piano, so the chords might not transfer to guitar so 
well, but I'm 99.9% sure they're right!
Listen to the song for the proper rhythms and chord placements. :)

The strong winter storm,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]
As it blows from the north.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Gm[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
Brings danger, to our bones.[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
But with careful retreat,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
As careful can be.[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Gm[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
We might just, make it home.[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Oh and try as we may, Your love always remains,[/tab]

And we cannot afford to be afraid anymore, let's stay the course.[/tab]
[tab]([ch]Bb[/ch])    [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]Dm[/ch]
Hold on tight, Jesus Christ, [/tab]

Satellites are calling.[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
As we brace for the sound,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
Of the deafening crowd,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Gm[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]
Screaming: "Lord, have mercy now".[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]
I hear the words of my King,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
As they echo underneath:[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Gm[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
"My hand awaits, rise to your feet".[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Oh and die as we may, Your love always remains.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bb[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]Bb[/ch]
And we cannot afford, to be afraid anymore, let's stay the course. [/tab]
[tab]([ch]Bb[/ch])          [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Dm[/ch]
And hold on tight, Jesus Christ, [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
Satellites are calling.[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
Hey-oh, hey-oh... We're not alone.[/tab]

(Interjections by the lead vocals, continue Bb F Dm C progression)

We're not, we're not, we're not alone.

No, we're not alone.

We're not, we're not alone...

We're not alone, no, no.

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
Hey-oh, hey-oh. We're not alone.[/tab]

       Come on, come on! (Thrown in by lead vocalist after the first Hey-oh)
[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
Hey-oh, hey-oh. Were not alone.[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]      [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]
Hey-oh, hey-oh. Were not alone.[/tab]

The ending to this song doesn't really have a defined chord progression, so I'll 
leave it at that. :) 
Enjoy!

[Verse 1]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
When I found your broken heart on the ground[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
I should have put it back, but I took it to my house[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]
'Cause you were drawn into me[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
And I was drawn to you[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
You were beaten up and bitter by the cards that you were dealt[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
Unlucky as a mother, neither one of us could help[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
That you were drawn into me[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
And I was drawn to you[/tab]

[Pre-chorus]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
We didn’t know what we were doing[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
And anyway, it all worked out[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]N.C                     [ch]C[/ch]
Follow your heart around[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Am[/ch]
Let it lead you out the door[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
Walk you off the edge and[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]
Leave you wanting more[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
Follow your heart around[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
Let it take you way too far[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Dm[/ch]
And put you back together[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
When you don't know who you are[/tab]
[tab]N.C.              [ch]C[/ch]
Follow your heart around[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Follow your heart around[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
When they say you're off the track, yeah, you’re a dreamer, disregard[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Keep doing what you love till it tears you apart[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]
'Cause you got nothing left to lose[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
I've got less than you[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
Yeah, I wish I had a little bit more money in the bank[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
But I chase these crazy dreams till there's no cash left[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
Yeah, nothing left to lose[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
I've got less than you[/tab]

[Pre-chorus]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]

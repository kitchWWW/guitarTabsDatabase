Artist: The Wind and The Wave
Song: Grand Canyon
Genre: 
Key: 


Simplified version of this song so it might not be perfect. this is my first tab, I watched the guitarist 
play this and then listened for the right chords, it should be fairly accurate and if not it still 
sounds good. enjoy! the strumming pattern is DDDDDDDD the entire time until you hit the chorus. 
once you get there just do DUDU UDU UDU UDU


*- stop playing on this chord

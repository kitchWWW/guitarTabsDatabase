Song:           The Size of a Cow
Artist:         The Wonder Stuff
Tabbed By:      Jefferson Humber
Date:           01-SEP-2005

This is a classic tune, and sounds great on the acoustic guitar.
Couldn't find a tab anywhere for this, so worked it out myself.

Play barre chords throughout, except for the bridge which sounds better in open chords.


[Intro]
[ch]B[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  ([ch]G#[/ch])  [ch]A[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                                 [ch]A[/ch]
Don't you think it's funny that nothing's what it seems[/tab]

When you're not looking forward
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Me I'd like to think that life is like a drink[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                          ([ch]Bb[/ch])  [ch]B[/ch]
And I'm hoping that it tastes like bourbon[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
You know that I've been drunk a thousand times[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
And these should be the best days of my life[/tab]

Life it's not what I thought it was


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Damn blast look at my past[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
I'm ripping up my feet over broken glass[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
I said oh wow look at me now[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
I'm building up my problems to the size of a cow[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]  ([ch]G#[/ch]) [ch]A[/ch]
Aah Aah...the size of a cow[/tab]


[Interlude]
[ch]B[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                                 [ch]A[/ch]
You know it would be strange to live life in a cage[/tab]

And only believe the things you see that are written on the page
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
How easy would it be home in time for tea[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                          ([ch]Bb[/ch])  [ch]B[/ch]
And stop feeling like a sailboat rocking on the sea[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
You know that it's been sunk a thousand times[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
And these should be the best days of my life[/tab]

Life it's not what I thought it was

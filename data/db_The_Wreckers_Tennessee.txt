Tuning: standard
Capo on fourth fret

[tab]this is the riff after many lines during the verses, I'm referring to it as X:
e|----------------------|
B|----------------------|
G|----------------------|
D|--0-0--2-2/4-2-0---0h2|
A|-----------------3----|
E|----------------------|[/tab]
[tab]also, when switching chords often hit the bottom string at 0 and then hold to correct 
such as:
   Cadd9  G
e|--3-----3-----|
B|--3-----3-----|
G|--0-----0-----|
D|--2-----0-----|
A|--0h3---2-----|
E|--x-----0h3---|

verse 1:
Cadd9               G
I never had all the answers
Em                 D      (X)
I never had enough time
Cadd9              G
I sure had all the reasons
    Em                      D         (X)
Why you weren't what I wanted to find

verse 2:
Cadd9                G
I never layed all my cards out
Em                 D      (X)
You just wanted to play
Cadd9                    G
The king he waited on my doorsteps
          Em                  D       (X)
While the joker in me went on our way

chorus:
Cadd9       D
Maybe I was much too selfish
    G    D/F#               C      C  G/B
But baby you're still on my mind
       Cadd9      D
Now I'm grown and all alone
    G             D/F#    Em
And wishing I was with you tonight
        C             C   G/B D
Cause I can guarantee
                      Cadd9    G  Cadd9  G
Things are sweeter in Tennessee

verse 3:
Cadd9                      G
These days everything is all business
    Em                      D
I'm never in one place for too long
Cadd9                     G
There's no lack of arms around me
            Em                    D         (X)
But I still wonder if somewhere I went wrong

chorus:
Cadd9       D
Maybe I was much too selfish
    G    D/F#               C      C  G/B
But baby you're still on my mind

    G             D/F#    Em
And wishing I was with you tonight
        C             C   G/B D
Cause I can guarantee
                      Cadd9    G  Cadd9  G
Things are sweeter in Tennessee

bridge:
Am                               Em
And I'd wish on every star in the southern sky
         C
For that man in our life
   D
If I did not think that, oh

chorus:
Cadd9       D
Maybe I was much too selfish
    G    D/F#               C      C  G/B
But baby you're still on my mind
       Cadd9      D
Now I'm grown and all alone
    G             D/F#    Em
And wishing I was with you tonight
        C             C   G/B D
Cause I can guarantee
                      Cadd9    G
Things are sweeter in Tennessee
        Cadd9          G/B
Yes, I can guarantee
                      Cadd9    G  Cadd9  G
Things are sweeter in Tennessee


the ending is just Cadd9 and G, sometimes sliding the high strings like a D chord 
from 5th to 7th fret (e string)

| /  slide up
| \  slide down
| h  hold
| x  Mute note

[Intro]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                                       [ch]Bb[/ch]
I remember when I learned how to slow down[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
You told me nights like these rarely come around[/tab]


[Verse 1]
[tab]           [ch]Eb[/ch]
We started dancing on the rocks[/tab]

We had barely began to talk
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]
We were moving[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Eb[/ch]
Spilled some Henny on your socks[/tab]

So you ran back up on the rocks
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]
And you threw them[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]Eb[/ch]
I think I could get used to this[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
I think I could get used to this life[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Eb[/ch]
I think I could get used to this[/tab]
                N.C.
It's infinitely ordinary


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
Why, why, why, why don't I ever stay home?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
Why, why don't I ever lay low?[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Eb[/ch]
I think I could get used to this[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]Bb[/ch]
I think I could get used to this life[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
Why, why, why, why don't I ever stay home?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
Why, why don't I ever lay low?[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Eb[/ch]                                        N.C.          [ch]Eb[/ch] [ch]Bb[/ch]
I think I could get used to this infinitely ordinary life[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]           [ch]Eb[/ch]
We started dancing on the roof[/tab]

Might as well have been on the moon
[tab]       [ch]Bb[/ch]
It was heaven[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Eb[/ch]
Guess I didn't see the pool[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Bb[/ch]
I was busy looking at you when I fell in[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]Eb[/ch]
I think I could get used to this[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]Bb[/ch]
I think I could get used to this life[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Eb[/ch]
I think I could get used to this[/tab]
                N.C.
It's infinitely ordinary


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
Why, why, why, why don't I ever stay home?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
Why, why don't I ever lay low?[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Eb[/ch]
I think I could get used to this[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]Bb[/ch]
I think I could get used to this life[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                              [ch]Bb[/ch]
Why, why, why, why don't I ever stay home?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]                    [ch]Bb[/ch]
Why, why don't I ever lay low?[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Eb[/ch]                                        N.C.         
I think I could get used to this infinitely ordinary life[/tab]

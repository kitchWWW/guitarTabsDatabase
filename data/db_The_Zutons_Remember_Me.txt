Verse 1
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]              
Well we used to be the best of friends [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]
And we used to hang around [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Now I always see you and your new girlfriend [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]
On the sunny side of town[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Oh your body is the same and your face ain't changed [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]
But your mind ain't where that's at [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
You're too busy hugging and a-kissing now [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
And for you that can't be bad [/tab]

[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
But I've made a deal with the clouds[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch] 
Gonna turn that sun into rain [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch] 
So you forget about your love [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Come and see me again [/tab]

Pre Chorus
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]         
Oh remember me I'm your best friend[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch] 
And we don't talk no more [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
So if you're in the neighbourhood [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Don't forget to knock on my door [/tab]

Chorus
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
Cause I've got to keep the feeling, keep the feeling in [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Gotta keep the feeling, keep the feeling in [/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Gotta keep the feeling, keep the feeling in [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Gotta keep the feeling, keep the feeling in [/tab]

Verse 2 (same as verse 1)

Now I stand upon your path 
And I'm shouting up to you 
Won't you come and give me a minute now 
There's a message here for you 
Me and a couple of old school friends 
We're going out to drink 
You can come along but leave your girl at home 
It'll give you time to think 

But you called at the last minute 
Said that you were staying in 
Well this is not a joke old friend 
I'm a-getting sick of this 

Pre Chorus

Oh remember me when she leaves you 
And you come and knock on my door 
Well I can nurse your broken heart 
Cause that's what friends are for 

Chorus 
Cause I've got to keep the feeling, keep the feeling in 
Gotta keep the feeling, keep the feeling in 
Gotta keep the feeling, keep the feeling in 
Gotta keep the feeling, keep the feeling in

Outro

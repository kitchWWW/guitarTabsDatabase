Even better than the real thing
Even better than the real thing.

Chords:

 Am           Dadd2
Is it getting better
 Fmaj7             G6+
Or do you feel the same
 Am             Dadd2
Will it make it easier on you
 Fmaj7                  G6+
Now you got someone to blame

You say
 C        Am
One love, one life
 Fmaj7            C
When it's one need in the night
             Am
It's one love we get to share it
  Fmaj7                  C
It leaves you baby if you don't care for it

        Am-Dadd2-Fmaj7-G6+

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light

We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

[Solo]

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much, more than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got

We're one, but we're not the same
We hurt each other then we do it again

You say
 C                Am
Love is a temple, Love a higher law
 C                Am
Love is a temple, Love the higher law
     C                    G
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
                      Fmaj7
And I can't be holding on to what you got
                     C
When all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should

One life with each other
Sisters, brothers

One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

One. One.

Haven't seen you in quite a while

I was down the hold, just passing time

Last time we met was a low-lit room

We were as close together as bride and groom

We ate the food, we drank the wine

Everybody having a good time
            D9
Except you
            A9
You were talking about the end of the world

E E E E E E Esus4 E  (4 times)

I took the money, I spiked your drink
You miss too much these days if you stop to think
You led me on with those innocent eyes
You know I love the element of surprise
In the garden I was playing the tart
I kissed your lips and broke your heart
You, you were acting like it was the end of the world

In my dream I was drowning my sorrows
But my sorrows they learned to swim
Surrounding me, going down on me
Spilling over the brim

I reached out for the one I tried to destroy
You, you said you'd wait 'til the end of the world.

Who's gonna taste your salt water kisses?
Who's gonna take the place of me?
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?

A                         Asus4
We crossed the line
A                         Asus4
Who pushed who over?
A                         Asus4
It doesn't matter to you
A                         Asus4
it matters to me
A                         Asus4
We're cut adrift
A                         Asus4
But still floating
A                         Asus4
I'm only hanging on
A               E           A
To watch you go down...my love

I disappeared in you
You disappeared from me
I gave you everything you ever wanted
It wasn't what you wanted
The men who love you, you hate the most
They pass through you like a ghost
They look for you but your spirit is in the air
Baby...you're nowhere

A-D-E-A
Aaaaaaah,
A          D          E      A
You say in love there are no rules
A  D  E  A            E
Oh......love  Sweetheart
           A
You're so cruel

Desperation is a tender trap
It gets you every time
You put your lips to her lips
To stop the lie
Her skin is pale like God's only dove
Screams like an angel for your love
Then she makes you watch her from above
And you need her like a drug
You say in love there are no rules

Oh......love  Sweetheart, you're so cruel

F#m
She wears my love
        D
Like a see-through dress
A
Her lips say one thing
    E
Her movements something else
   C#m
Oh love, like a screaming flower
                      A
Love, dying every hour

And you don't know if it's fear or desire
Danger the drug that takes you higher?
Head of heaven, fingers in the mire
Her heart is racing... you can't keep up
The night is bleeding like a cut
Between the horses of love and lust
We are trampled underfoot

You say in love there are no rules
Oh......love  Sweetheart
You're so cruel

To stay with you I'd be a fool
   D      C#m       A           E
oh....hah           hah   Sweetheart
          A
You're so cruel.

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
              A                 D
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by a moon
                E
You know I don't see you when she walks in the room

It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something you tell one other person
So I'm telling you, child

  C#m  E
(Love, we shine like a             A man will beg
  A
Burning star                       A man will crawl
We're fallin' from                 On the sheer face of love
    C#m  E     A                   Like a fly from the wall
The sky... tonight)                It's no secret at all

It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret that ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal Every poet is a thief
All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief

Solo: B    E-A-D-E-B-C#m-E-A

(Love, we shine like a              A man will rise
Burning star                        A man will fall
We're falling from                  From the sheer face of love
The sky... tonight)                 Like a fly from the wall
                                    It's no secret at all
        E
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
The universe exploding 'cosa one man's lie
Look I gotta go, yeah I'm running out of change
There's a lot of things if I could I'd rearrange

 "Mysterious Ways"
  ---------------

(Heavy distortion recommended)

This song can be played with a capo on the 8th fret, if you can do that.
Then it becomes fairly simple just playing D instead of A, etc. (see the
chord formations). Or you can play it with a capo on 1st fret, which is
how I've finally put the chords. [Editor's Comment]

You've been living underground, eating from a can
A                                       E           A
You've been running away from what you don't understand (love)

(So, when you see A or D, play the above chord formations, respectively)

A              D
She's slippy, you're sliding down
A                D
She'll be there when you hit the ground

A                      D
It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
C               G
She moves in mysterious ways
A                      D
It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
C               G
She moves in mysterious ways

Johnny take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you can't explain
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky
Better learn how to kneel (...on your knees boy!)

She's the wave, she turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child

It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways                    (x3)
It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
Lift my days...light up my nights

                G               A
Where you were held how by this love
                 D
While you could stand there
        C
And not move on this moment
G
Follow this feeling

It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
We move through miracle days
Spirit moves in mysterious ways

Lift my days and light up my nights

 "Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around The World"
  ------------------------------------------

 A                  D
Six o'clock in the morning
            A                D
You're the last to hear the warning
                A                 D                   A  D
You've been trying to throw your arms around the world

You've been falling off the sidewalk
Your lips move but you can't talk
Tryin' to throw your arms around the world

           A            D            A         D      A   D-A-D
I'm gonna run to you...run to you...run to you...be still
           A            D            A         D      A   D-A-D
I'm gonna run to you...run to you...run to you...woman I will

Sunrise like a nosebleed, your head hurts and you can't breathe
You been tryin' to throw you arms around the world
How far are you gonna go before you lose your way back home?
You've been trying to throw your arms around the world

I'm gonna run to you...

I dreamed that I saw Dali with a supermarket trolley
He was trying to throw his arms around a girl
He took an open top beetle through the eye of a needle
He was tryin' to throw his arms around the world

I'm gonna run to you...

Bridge: A-E-D-A      A-E-D      A-D-A-D-.....

Nothin' much to say I guess, just the same as all the rest
Been trying to throw your arms around the world
A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle
When you're tryin' to throw your arms around the world

I'm gonna run to you...run to you
I'm gonna run to you...run to you
I'm gonna run to you...run to you
Woman be still...woman be still
Be still...woman be still, woman I will

 "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)"
  --------------------------

[Keyboard plays a C#m on this sentence]

"Sometimes I feel like I don't know, sometimes I feel like checking out
I wanna get it wrong, can't always be strong, and love it won't be long"

Intro: E G#m A (this is structure (1))

(1)	Oh sugar, don't you cry,
	oh child wipe the tears from your eyes
	You know I need you to be strong,
	and the day's as dark as the night is long

     	 C#m                        B
(2)  	Feel like trash, you make me feel clean
	 A
	I'm in the black, can't see or be seen
         C#m         B             A
        Baby, baby, baby, light my way
         C#m         B             A
        Baby, baby, baby, light my way

(1) 	You bury your treasure where it can't be found
	But your love's like a secret that's been passed around
	There is a silence that comes to a house where no one can sleep

(2)     I guess it's the price of love, I know it's not cheap
	Oh, come on, baby, baby, baby, light my way
	Oh, come on, baby, baby, baby, light my way

	E  B  C#m   A   (twice)
(3)	Ooooh, ultraviolet...
	C#m    	         B		      E     A
	Baby, baby, baby, light my way

(1)	I remember when we could sleep on stones
	But now we lie together in whispers and moans
	When I was all messed up, and I heard opera in my head

(2)     Your love was a lightbulb hanging over my bed
	Baby, baby, baby, light my way
	Baby, baby, baby, light my way

(3)     Ooooh, ultraviolet...

        G#m               A    E                B
(4)	Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,
        C#m           B            E
        Baby, baby, baby, light my way

 "Acrobat"
  -------

Intro: Em7 Am

 Am                     G    Fmaj7                  Em/D
Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see
 Am                     G          Fmaj7        Em/D
If you just close your eyes you can feel the enemy

When I first met you girl, you had fire in your soul
What happened your face of melting snow?

        C
Now it looks like this
    Am7
and you can swallow or you can spit
         F              G
You can throw it up or choke on it

And you can dream, so dream out loud
     F              G                Am7
You know that your time is coming 'round
        F          G                   Am
... Don't let the bastards grind you down

No nothing makes sense, nothing seems to fit
I know you'd hit out if you only knew who to hit
And I'd join the movement if there was one I could believe in
Yeah I'd break bread and wine if there was a church I could receive in

'Cos I need it now
To take the cup, to fill it up
To drink it slow, I can't let you go
And I must be an Acrobat to talk like this and act like that
And you can dream, so dream out loud
... Don't let the bastards grind you down

What are we going to do now it's all been said?
No new ideas in the house, and every book has been read

And I must be an acrobat
To talk like this and act like that
And you can dream, so dream out loud
And you can find your own way out
You can build and I can will
And you can call I can't wait until
You can stash and you can seize
In dreams begin responsibilities
And I can love, and I can love
I know that the tide is turning 'round
...Don't let the bastards grind you down

 "Love Is Blindness"
  -----------------

         Bm                 A
Love is blindness, I don't want to see
           G               Em
Won't you wrap the night around me
Bm          F#          Bm
Take my heart, love is blindness

In a parked car, in a crowded street
You see your love made complete
Thread is ripping, the knot is slipping, love is blindness

Love is clockworks, and cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle, love is blindness

Love is blindness, I don't want to see
Won't you wrap the night around me
Oh my love, blindness

          C               G/B
A little death, without mourning
    F#           Bm
No call, and no warning
           C          G/B
Baby... a dangerous idea
        F#
That almost makes sense

Solo: Bm A  G  Em  Bm  F#  Bm

Love is drowning in a deep well
All the secrets and no one to tell
Take the money, honey, blindness

Love is blindness, I don't want to see
Won't you wrap the night around me
Oh my love, blindness

End: Bm A  G  Em  Bm  F#  Bm

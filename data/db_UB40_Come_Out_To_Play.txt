Tabbed by J Noel


[Verse]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]
He used to think that it was neat[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]B[/ch]
When he hung out on the street[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]
Now that it's his daily beat, he's not so sure[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]
Cause he's come to depend[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
On a street with a dead end[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
And he'll sell you his best friend, so he can score[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Boys and girls come out to play[/tab]
[tab] [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]
The junk mans on the streets to say[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]
He'll make your dreams feel real today[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]B[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]
And steal your minds tomorrow[/tab]

[Verse]

[tab][ch]B[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]B[/ch]
Now his thoughts don't seem so clear[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]
His whole life is filled with fear[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
His habit cost him dear in every way[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]      [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
His girl can't take the heat[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]B[/ch]
But his friends all cross the street[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Still the needle keeps him sweet[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
If he can pay for one more day[/tab]

[Verse]

[tab][ch]B[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
His bones have got no meat[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]
He's unsteady on his feet[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]
And he doesn't get to eat, not every day[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Boys and girls come out to play[/tab]
[tab] [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
The junk mans on the streets to say[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
He'll make your dreams feel real today[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]
And steal your minds tomorrow[/tab]

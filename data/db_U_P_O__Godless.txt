I don't need to say I'm godless[/tab]
with nowhere to fall

repeat intro x2

continue that patters for all subsequent verses and choruses

Verse 2:
Day by day, I'm like a playful puppet and I'm stumbling 'round
Aching on the brain and I'm in big trouble, big trouble
I still got to breathe, oh yeah, like my shame this will all go down
God damned me thats for sure and I believe...
I believe I don't belong here

Chorus 2:
I don't need - to get my head kicked in
and I don't need to be another lost soul who can't find home
I don't need to get my face dragged down through the muddy water
I don't need to say I godless - anymore

Bridge:(I am not sure about the picking, you can just strum the chords here)
Still I'm gone
Still I'm on the run
Still I'm on the break of the edge
Still I'm, still I'm feeling dead

Chorus 3:
I don't need to be godless - but I am
I don't need to be another lost soul who can't find home
I don't need your hand of god
I don't need to say I'm godless - anymore

repeat chorus strumming here once without the lyrics
after the last line fade out with D9 so that each string rings, like this:

[ch]D9[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]/[ch]G[/ch]/[ch]A[/ch] x3
[ch]D9[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch](hold chord) [ch]D9[/ch](let strings ring)

That's it. I will post the individual picking during the bridge when I figure it out for sure.

Key: 


[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
It was the rage of plastics, I was 24[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]
I was doing my time on the dance floor[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Dm[/ch]
It was all polyester and leopard print[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
And Faberg√© comin' off the ladies[/tab]

You know it's a blight to the brightest how our designs unseam
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
Like the backside of some skirt in some old man's dream[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
I got caught putting off all my traveling plans[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bb[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
For this refinery job and his maybes[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
With hair in ribbons, stockings in runs[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]                               [ch]Am[/ch]
Fashion bricks out of the breaks as they come[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Land goes for less downwind of the plant[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]
There's no telling how long you'll be paying[/tab]


[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
There are scores of us born in the silent spring[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
Whose wombs won't take, won't bear anything[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
He had want for a daughter, and I had want for a son[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]
Now I rock my moon faced man like one[/tab]

Was it the river on fire that made us what we became?
[tab]           [ch]Dm[/ch]
Was it the cup that we drank from, or what it contained?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
Does it move to the beat of the oil drums[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bb[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
Or flow out of our eyes as we're wailing?[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
And I see it rise in ribbons to the clouds overhung[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
Just to spit back down on everyone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
Land goes for less downwind of the plant[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
There's no telling how long you'll be paying[/tab]


[Verse 3]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I have tried to be patient as I've been made nurse[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]
Get some help from the perks of my devotion's curse[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]
And I know, yeah, I know the man's pain is much worse[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]
For the moon and his grace are now waning[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
You say the first one now will later be last[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
My faith in scripture has come to pass[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Dm[/ch]
No, I won't play dumb[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]
I'm done trying to sweeten this load[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
And you give me a ribbon, you tell me to run[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Dm[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
To lend my legs to your Narcissus fund[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
But land still goes for less downwind of the plant[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
Making this living just brings about dying[/tab]


[Verse 4]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I got a rage of plastics, the refinery floor[/tab]

I got a rage of plastics, got nothing more
[tab]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
Now I won't play dumb and I'm done lying[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
Making this living just brings about dying[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
But land still goes for less downwind of the plant[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
Making this living just brings about dying[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
Making this living just brings about dying[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
Making this living just brings about dying[/tab]

Who condones a whole world's subjugation from a virus we've found no answer[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
Man sometimes its hard to be dutiful, wish you'd all just be dutiful[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]Dm[/ch]
Stay inside, wear a mask, wash your hands, give me warning[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
If your temperature rising above yeah,          normal[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]Dm[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Please keep your distance, not trying to be rude but I don't know[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Well they say its almost over, who condones[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
The CDC, hard to believe in anything[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
That they tell me for comfort, guess we'll see (yeah)[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Who condones, tell me, I know the rich and powerful[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                                         [ch]F[/ch]
Ya know they're not getting sick like the rest of us[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
A coincidence, I don't think so, but what do I know[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Walking towards a bright light, moments after we were alone[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
Secluded from our loved ones, forced to watch them die[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]Dm[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I wonder whose more lonely, the one whose dying or watching it[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
All of the loved ones that we have lost are resting so peaceful[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Dm[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
You know we're left here to mourn them, make sure that their memories will last[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
If I spoke to my god, I would slam my hand down to the ground and ask[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Who condones tell me, I pray that it just wasn't you[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
Although I guess that it just would be better[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
The alternative just makes everything red, I'm a bull[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
Is there none left to trust, I tell ya I don't really know[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
When over eyes I'm feeling wool, I can never feel peaceful[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
I can never feel peaceful[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
I can never feel peaceful[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
I want to be immune. Eh-Everybody wants their mind at ease[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                             [ch]G[/ch]
Its gonna take a little bit more time, so lets all try to be patient please[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]
We're all still free, ever heard of a social credit score[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
If not, I suggest that you go and read a book, take a look, you're mistook (yeah)[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Who condones tell me, just ask who is left on top[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]
And who is still stuck there down at the bottom[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                                              [ch]C[/ch]
All you gotta do, is just follow that money and you'll see[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
I know there is a villain[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                                              [ch]C[/ch]
Who condones the world's suffering and all of its misery[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
When your final day comes, guarantee, you'll get that misery right back to thee[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Who condones tell me, is it left or is it right[/tab]

[Verse 5]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
When I look at all our division, all that I see is a once great country[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
We just need to heal our scars, we're not too far gone, that we can't come back from this[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
As long as we keep trying, anything is better than hates most ugly sting[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Who condones tell me, how do we heal our scars...[/tab]

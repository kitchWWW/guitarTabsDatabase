[tab][ch]D[/ch]			[ch]A[/ch]
Nobody blowin' up my phone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]			[ch]G[/ch]
I ain't buzzin' and I ain't stoned[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]			  [ch]G[/ch]		
But I'm ridin', flyin' higher than the blue sky[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]			               [ch]A[/ch]
If you don't like me, brother, that's okay[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]			     [ch]G[/ch]
I ain't gonna let it wreck my day[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]			  [ch]G[/ch]	
I keep stylin', smilin', handin' out the sunshine[/tab]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]		        [ch]A[/ch]	
I got no good reason why[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]			  [ch]A[/ch]
Damn, it feels good to be me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]			[ch]G[/ch]
Seats laid back in my Cutlass Supreme[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]A[/ch]      
I'll be alright, rollin' these streets[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
All summer long[/tab]

Damn, I got it all figured out
I got no worries that I'm worried about
It's like I caught some crazy-happy disease
Damn, it feels good to be me

Bought some cheap shades at the Amoco Station
They make me feel like I'm on vacation
On my own island, Motor City paradise

Ain't it funny how time flies?

Damn, it feels good to be me
T-Top's down in my Cutlass Supreme
I'll be alright, rollin' these streets
All summer long

Damn, I got it all figured out
I got no worries that I'm worried about
It's like I caught some crazy-happy disease
Damn, it feels good to be me

[tab][ch]A[/ch]......Muted
Got no particular place to go[/tab]
My Alpine's pumpin' some Motown soul
Rockin' to "Papa Was A Rollin' Stone"

Damn, it feels good to be me
Fresh pair of kicks and my old blue jeans
I'll be alright , rollin' these streets
All summer long

Damn, I got it all figured out
I got no worries that I'm worried about
It's like I caught some Coltrane Love Supreme
Damn, it feels good to be me

(Coltrane Love Supreme)
It feels so good
(Coltrane Love Supreme)
It feels so good
(Coltrane Love Supreme)
Damn, it feels good

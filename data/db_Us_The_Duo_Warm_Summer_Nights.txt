Sweet sixteen in the car I bought, we're in my Civic in the parking lot[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Making out 'til we couldn't stop, oh Lord, it was hot as hell[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Had my cargos and my flip-flops,  writing ditties in the attic loft[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Overheating on my laptop,  oh Lord, it was hot as hell[/tab]

[Pre Chorus 1]

[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, the Carolina nights,  drinking bags of wine[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
We're riding in the back of a pick-up truck[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, with all my windows down,  I think of my hometown and all those[/tab]

[Chorus 1]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
Warm summer nights,  can't you feel the warm breeze blowing?[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Can't you see the fireflies glowing,  and the big moon in the sky?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
I swear there is no better time,  than those warm summer nights[/tab]

Sweet sixteen in my CRV,  I had my friends but no AC[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Jean shorts and cut-off tees,  oh lord, it was hot as hell[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Cheap beer and jello shots,  playing pong on the tabletop[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
Stayed quiet so didn't we get caught,  oh Lord, it was hot as hell[/tab]

[Pre chorus 2]

[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Oh the California nights,  never a cloud in sight[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]
Makin' bonfires 'til they're burning bright[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, I can see it now,  singing songs about all those[/tab]

[Chorus 2]

[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
Warm summer nights,  can't you feel the warm breeze blowing?[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Can't you see the fireflies glowing,  and the big moon in the sky?[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]

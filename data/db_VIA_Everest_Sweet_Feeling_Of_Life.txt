[Lyrics]

Oh the sweet feeling of life, the feeling that just holds you down
And you just cant seem to escape, no you can't

Watch as the day go flying by, faster than the weeks passing by
Only got time to make it right, before you collapse into your mind.

Watch as your life crumbles away, only your lifeless body will remain
On this world thats crumbling dow

Noone will remember, noone will think
When someone mentions your name, they will say "Who are they?"

Just the sweet feeling of life, just the sweet feeling of life
Just the sweet feeling of life, just the sweet feeling of life

Just the sweet feeling of life, just the sweet feeling of life
Just the sweet feeling of life, just the sweet feeling of life

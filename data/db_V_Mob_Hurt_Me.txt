all the pieces of the puzzle seem to fall into place [/tab]
but the only thought that i can think is pissin' in that fucking face
the taste that you left in my mouth was rotten and you
think that all the shit you did to me could be forgotten
well fuck no! you both got me last time
 next time i see your punk ass its mine
from behind dawg gonna crack that skull then gonna 
laugh when you fall cause you fucked me raw

comin home in the night when you're sneaking at the door with the 
bottle half empty and your tank is on full.
you hurt me! i will never forget how you 
hurt me! all the pain youve caused left my 
mind blank and my soul is lost an now the 
thoughts are in my head and drifting side to side you 
know im gonna get ya cause there's nowhere to hide
headlines I'll read of the night she died

kills me! for the rest of your life you can
feel me! gonna make you remember that you
hurt me, fucking hurt me!

body in the valley in an alley in the ditch[/tab]

	WHEN YOU DANCE WITH HIM ,YOU LOOK SO THIN

	THAT I CAN ALMOST LOOK

	THROUGH YOU TO SEE

	WHEN YOU DANCE WITH HIM,I SEE LOSERS WIN

	AND LOSERS NOT WHO

	THE?RE SUPPOSED TO BE

	CHORUS:

	GOODNIGHT YOU LOSER

	YOU MIDNIGHT MOONLIGHT USER

	ITS TIME FOR YOU TO TRY TO GO TO SLEEP

	BREAK:

	WHEN YOU DANCE WITH HIM,I SEE YOU BLEND

	INTO WHO YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

	WHEN YOU DANCE WITH HIM,

	THE TIME YOU SPEND

	BEGINS TO TURN YOU IN TO SOMETHING CHEAP

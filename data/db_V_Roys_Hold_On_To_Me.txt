G Em C D      G   Em  C  D
You... hold onto me
                G    Em    C
Like you're the only one
          D          G       Em     C      D
Who could care about me

Em                 D         C         G       Em     C      D
Did you ever think how blind you could be?
Em                      D       C     D       
Did you ever think that I could be so mean?

G Em C D      G   Em  C  D
You... hold onto me
                G    Em    C
Like you're the only one
          D          G       Em     C      D
Who could care about me

(Same as Above)
Did you ever feel like there was something wrong?
Did you ever feel like I was already gone?

You hold onto me
Like you're the only one
Who could care about me

Did you ever think that I'd be with someone else?
Do you ever think that you could trust yourself?

Subject: CHORDS: 'Lie I Believe' by the V-roys.

Lie I Believe - The V-roys
Words and music by the V-roys
>From the album 'Just Add Ice' on E-squared records.
(This is Steve Earle's label, catalog # 1050-2)

This album was released in the fall of '96 and is an excellent
roots-rock type record, though one tune (Cry) sounds a bit like
early Police and others are reminiscent of, maybe, Cracker and
even Elvis Costello w/ the Attractions.  However it gets binned,
this is great American rock and roll laced with country, very
well done, with loads of lyrical cleverness and passion but it
probably won't be played on American radio since it doesn't fit
snugly into a particular genre.  Let's just call it V-roys music,
and f@!* the radio--buy the album!

You said I was someone its a lie I believe[/tab]


Instrumental break:
The first bar is a barre chord E minus bass notes, then slide
down to Eb and then D (I'm not sure here but it sounds okay)
before moving up to A for the second bar: play along and its
easy to mimic.

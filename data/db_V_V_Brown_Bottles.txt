[tab][ch]G7[/ch]                  [ch]Cm[/ch]
 How can I find the way to tell you this; [/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]G7[/ch]
The things you seem to do all over me? Read the dictionary;[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cm[/ch]                                                       [ch]Em[/ch]

 To all the fellas trying to look, I'm sorry that I took available out.[/tab]

Chorus 1:

[tab][ch]G7[/ch]
 Seven on the car seat, six by the back street,[/tab]

 Four by the window, three in the shadow,[/tab]

 Oh, I tell no lie; you made me fall blind,[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]G7[/ch] 
To all the other guys within my life.[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Cm[/ch]
It's not complicated; when you find the one, [/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
It's easy to begin to rea-lise.[/tab]

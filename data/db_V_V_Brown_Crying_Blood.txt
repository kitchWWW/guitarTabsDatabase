Verse2: (Same chords as verse 1)
Don't you come with your medicine, 
and be a doctor in the time of a needy child.
I got my clothes in a mess for you,
that's my hair to the side and i'm going wild.
Tell me that you have turned around,
write a letter to my mother 'cause she's getting better.
You can even do the crazy stuff,
because the shame is in the fact that you have never met her.

Can't beleive what you do to me, can't you see?

Oh how you need me.

Desperately need me.
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
(wish you could)[/tab]
Wish you could love me.
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
(uncut just to)[/tab]
Uncut just to need me.

PAUSE, hold A

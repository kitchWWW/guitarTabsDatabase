[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
How does it feel like this[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
To be caught in a web of a heavy grip[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A#[/ch]
Where you might want to believe or try to admit[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]C[/ch]
That the one that you love is a fool you don't realize[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]
When will you finally wake up[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
And the love that you hold is a taste of bad luck[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A#[/ch]
And all that you have is a bag full of lies[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]
He's blinded you deep[/tab]

By the look in the pit of his eyes


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]
And If I knew that this could be[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
A total catastrophe[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I probably would have told you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
A little sooner so you wouldn't get hurt[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]
If I could change this possibly[/tab]
N.C.
It would be how you want this to be


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
'Cause it ain't over till it's all done[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]A#[/ch]
So let me finish my conversation[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]C[/ch]
Yes, I'm tryna get your attention[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]F[/ch]
'Cause your distracted by affection[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]Dm[/ch]
Can't you see that it isn't true[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]A#[/ch]
What you thought you had and you knew[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]C[/ch]
And I've been chosen to tell you[/tab]
N.C.
That you're stupid and you know you gotta do it
N.C.
LEAVE!


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
When you are deep in love[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
It is hard to see past all the dirt and the mud[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A#[/ch]
You tell everyone that it's great and okay[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
When you know in your heart[/tab]

That it hurts and it won't go away

[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Afraid to let go of the hand[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]Dm[/ch]
That you held so tight when he said "I'm your man"[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A#[/ch]
But his eyes seem to sway[/tab]

At the flick of a switch
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
And you are alone in the dark[/tab]

With a bruised broken heart


[Repeat Pre-Chorus:]
[tab][ch]A#[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
And If I knew that this could be[/tab]

A total catastrophe
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I probably would have told you[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                                [ch]A#[/ch]
A little sooner so you wouldn't get hurt[/tab]

If I could change this possibly
N.C.
It would be how you want this to be


[Repeat Chorus:]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                  [ch]Dm[/ch]
'Cause it ain't over till it's all done[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]A#[/ch]
So let me finish my conversation[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]C[/ch]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]Dm[/ch]

[tab]                                 [ch]A#[/ch]

And I've been chosen to tell you

LEAVE!


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
You know that I do get it right[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
The truest friend you can't deny[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]F#m[/ch]
You know that I don't tell a lie[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I know that you love him[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
It's clear that you put up a fight[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
To keep the love still in your life[/tab]

[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
But I must speak[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
The truth be told[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]
Even though I know you love him[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                  [ch]Dm[/ch]

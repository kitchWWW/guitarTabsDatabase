[Verse 1]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
On my pillow[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
Can’t get me tired[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
Sharing my fragile truth[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]
That I still hope the door is open[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
Cuz the window[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Em[/ch]
Opened one time with you and me[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]
Now my forever’s falling down[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
Wondering if you’d want me now[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
How could I know[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Em[/ch]
One day I’d wake up feeling more[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
But I had already reached the shore[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]
Guess we were ships in the night Night, night[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F[/ch]
We were ships in the night[/tab]


[Verse 3]
N.C
I’m wondering
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Are you my best friend[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]Em[/ch]
Feel’s like a river’s rushing through my mind[/tab]
[tab]                                          [ch]Am[/ch]
I wanna ask you If this is all just in my head[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]F[/ch]
My heart is pounding tonight I wonder[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
If you[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
Are too good to be true[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]
And would it be alright if I[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
Pulled you closer[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
How could I know[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Em[/ch]
One day I’d wake up feeling more[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]Am[/ch]
But I had already reached the shore[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]
Guess we were ships in the night Night, night[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F[/ch]
We were ships in the night Night, night...[/tab]

[Intro]

[ch]C[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch] (x2)

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
Feels like it's coming down all at once[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
I haven't been myself in months[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
Not sure there's anything you could say[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
And this pit in my stomach won't go away[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
When you can't slow down but you can't keep running[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
When you come so close but you still can't touch it[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
When the call you've been waiting on just ain't coming[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
When you get everything that you want but you can't feel nothing[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]
You want to feel something[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
Can't get to sleep don't wanna wake up[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
I don't feel like the day's ever done[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
Maybe you just need a change of weather[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
Keep reminding myself it won't last forever[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]
When you can't slow down but you can't keep running[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
When you come so close but you still can't touch it[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
When the call you've been waiting on just ain't coming[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
When you get everything that you want but you can't feel nothing[/tab]

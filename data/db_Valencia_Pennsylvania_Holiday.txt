Well the lights are shining on the houses that line my street[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
It seems that all I need[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                          
Is a pennsylvania holiday[/tab]

And it's the perfect time for the holidays[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
I don't think that I can wait[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
I've been so good this year[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]      
I feel that I've been making progress[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
And all I ask of you this time[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
Is a break from all the stress of life[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]               
Let's drink, let's sing, relax[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch] 
And bring the year in with a smile[/tab]


Verse 2:
Do you remember the stories we were told when we were kids
About snowfall and reindeer and that jolly old saint nick?
Do you miss feeling youthful or are you searching for clarity
About why we grew up and forgot just how to believe?

[tab]( [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] ) x2
Just get my friends and family[/tab]
And celebrate the warmth that Christmas brings
A pennsylvania holiday
Is all we need



Chorus


[tab]( [ch]F[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] ) x4
Well here's to the days when we had faith and such simple dreams[/tab]
Of waking up at dawn to a snow-filled lawn and the scent of christmas trees
Though time has passed this feeling lasts, or so it seems
We've gotten older now but we've finally found just what christmas means

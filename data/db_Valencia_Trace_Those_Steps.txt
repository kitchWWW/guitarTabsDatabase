Artist: Valencia
Song: Trace Those Steps
Genre: 
Key: 


First tab, it's really not hard to learn.
It's from Shane's side project called Promise of Redemption.
Just figure out the strumming yourself, it's pretty easy.
I'm working on the second guitar part right now- hopefully it'll be up soon.

ALSO: I couldn't figure out the chord name for one of them I was playing, so I named it 
(for D hammer on). All you do is play a normal D, and hammer on with your pinky on third 
on the e string. Simple enough.

Capo: 3rd fret

INTRO:
[ch]Cadd9[/ch], [ch]G[/ch], [ch]D[/ch], Dh
[ch]Cadd9[/ch], [ch]G[/ch], [ch]D[/ch](let ring)

VERSE:
[tab]            [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Well growing up never made much sense to me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
But dealing with this life I lead[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
And making oh so many plans[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
That never seem to come true in the end[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
And yeah I know that we were young[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
But age doesn't mean much when you're truly in love[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I'll hold on to that feeling that I always had[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
In hopes that one day I will see you again[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I know that one day I will see you again[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
And I'll keep holding my breath[/tab]

CHORUS:
[tab]         [ch]Cadd9[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                   Dh
So let's trace those steps back to where we first met[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Cadd9[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]                Dh
A place I'll never forget cause you and I we can not let[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cadd9[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                      Dh
All this space between a perfect you and perfect me[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Cadd9[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch](let ring)
It's just so hard to believe that you're gone[/tab]

VERSE:
[tab]  [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I tried my luck at so many things[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
I've seen enough joy to make me wanna sing[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I've hit the highest of highs, the lowest of lows[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
Right now I'm sick and tired of being alone[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
And as I trace those steps, the same very steps[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
That lead up to the room where we once slept[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I've got this pain in my chest[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Oh this pain that's too deep to keep tight lips[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Oh so I'll keep holding my breath[/tab]

CHORUS

PRECHORUS:
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
And oh my God, this hurts like hell[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
And how am I supposed to tell myself[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Cadd9[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
That if I keep on singing my way through this[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]Cadd9[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
That one da------------y, I'll be fine[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
One da------------y, I'll be fine[/tab]
_________________________________________________________________________

THESE PARTS ARE SUNG AT THE SAME TIME. It's played the same as the chorus, but if you 
to play and sing to the second part, the timing is off by a few seconds. The words in 
are the second voice part.

So I'll trace those steps back to where we first met

A place I'll never forget cause you and I we can't let

All this space between a perfect you and perfect me

It's just so hard to believe that you're gone

{One good thing about the road is that it opens up your eyes

It will make you miss your home and everything that lies

In your heart will be as clear as all of heaven's days

Cause I believe that you're not gone }

You're right here

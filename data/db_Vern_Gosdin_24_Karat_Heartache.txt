She’s got a 24 karat 24 hour never ending heartache on her hand [/tab]

[tab]                                          [ch]C[/ch]
Sometimes the cheapest words roll off her silver tongue [/tab]

[tab][ch]D7[/ch]
She's who she is and where she’s at [/tab]

[tab]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
Cause she didn't know enough to turn and run [/tab]


[tab]    [ch]G7[/ch]
She treasured his promises he promised her treasures [/tab]

[tab]                                        [ch]C[/ch]
And she had no way of knowing they were lies [/tab]

[tab]        [ch]D7[/ch]
Now the only thing that sparkles are the diamonds on her finger [/tab]

[tab]                                                [ch]G[/ch]
And the tears that fall like raindrops from her eyes [/tab]

 
[tab]                                         [ch]C[/ch]
Shes got a 24 karat heartache on her and hand [/tab]

It's a diamond that once blinded her and led her to believe in a man [/tab]

[tab]    [ch]G7[/ch]
Her ruby lips start trembling every time [/tab]

[tab]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
She starts talking about that golden band [/tab]

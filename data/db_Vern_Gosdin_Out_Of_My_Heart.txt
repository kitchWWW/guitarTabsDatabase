Recorded by Vern Gosdin

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
The only thing I know that's good[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G7[/ch]
About the days I'm livin' in[/tab]

Is knowing I'm still learning
[tab]                        [ch]C[/ch]
About what I don't understand[/tab]

How two people that love each other
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]
Have to live apart[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G7[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
It's enough to take the livin' out of my heart[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
When I get up in the mornin'[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
It's so hard to face my face[/tab]

As it tells me from the mirror
[tab]                      [ch]G7[/ch]
I'd rather be at your place[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]
It's hard to know we're still livin'[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
But we're livin' apart[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G7[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
It's enough to take the livin' out of my heart[/tab]

[Verse]

Lovin' one way livin' another
[tab]                  [ch]G7[/ch]
Who am I cheatin' on[/tab]

The one I want to be with
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Or the one I'm with at home[/tab]

It's hard to hold the pieces
[tab]                  [ch]F[/ch]
Of so many livin' parts[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G7[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
It's enough to take the livin' out of my heart[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
When I get up in the mornin'[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
It's so hard to face my face[/tab]

As it tells me from the mirror
[tab]                      [ch]G7[/ch]
I'd rather be at your place[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]
It's hard to know we're still livin'[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
But we're livin' apart[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G7[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
It's enough to take the livin' out of my heart[/tab]

It's enough to take the livin' out of my heart[/tab]

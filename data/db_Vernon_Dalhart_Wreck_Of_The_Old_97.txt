[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
They gave him his orders,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]
At Monroe, Virginia,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Sayin' Pete you're way behind time.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
This is not '38, but its old '97,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
You must put her into Spencer on time.[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He looked round an' said,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
To his black, greasy fireman,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Jus' shove on in a lil' more coal.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
And when we cross that wide old mountain,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
You can watch old '97 roll.[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Its a mighty rough road,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
From Lynchburg to Danville,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
In a line on a three mile grade.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
It was on that grade,[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
That he lost his airbrake,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
And you see what a jump he made.[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
He was goin' down the grade,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
Makin' ninety miles an hour,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
When his whistle broke into a scream.[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
He was found in the wreck,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
With his hand on the throttle,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
And a scalded to death by the steam.[/tab]

[Verse 5]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Now ladies you must take warnin',[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
From this time now and on.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Never speak harsh words,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
To your true love and husband,[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
He may leave you and never return.[/tab]

Hope ya have fun with this timeless standard.

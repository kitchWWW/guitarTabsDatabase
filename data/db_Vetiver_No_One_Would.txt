G* A*              G* A*
So you've come back home
to the USA
And your lips look new and they have things to say
that Ive never heard

I should be on with
We would talk by the bay
Now your eyes face east, they've seen things that say
What Ive never heard
No one would
A word like love could explain or contend what Im feelin

        D      G         D
Now Ill try to summon the
G                 D
words to catch the
G                   D                        G*   A*   G*   A*
ways that keep when we can touch-I wont wont ask for
G* A*              G* A*
I wont ask for
G* A*              G* A*
I wont ask for much
G* A*              G* A*
I wont ask for much
G* A*              G* A*
I wont ask for much
G* A*              G* A*
I wont ask for much


     Em
Just show me how to bring
A
Clarity to bed
Em                    A
Down on what Ive come to believe that we would share
Em
To see and to believe
A
We could make the way
Em
(????????????)
A
(????????????)
Em
To make that start
A
To be so bold
           Em        A
Now you've come back home
    Em     A
all out of touch
    Em         A
Is that asking much?
       Em        A
Have I asked you much?
       G*      A*        G*     A*
I wont ask for much
       G*      A*        G*     A*
I wont ask for much
       G*      A*        G*     A*
No, I wont ask for much
       G*      A*        G*     A*
I wont ask for much

G* A*              G* A*

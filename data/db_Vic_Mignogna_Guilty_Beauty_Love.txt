[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]           
What a crime, such a beautiful crime[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]Em[/ch]
That God would make a star as bright as I[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]     
And I know it's a disgrace to admire this perfect face[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
Reflected in your eyes[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
So it's right, that I suffer tonight[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
All the pain of all the passion inside[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
But my heart can not deny what I'm feeling inside[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]
That makes me long for you[/tab]

Guilty, Beauty, Love

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Take my hand, take the key[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
You can open the door[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Take a step, take a chance[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch] 
Now you'll find there's so much more[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
There's a world you've dreamed of and if you'll allow[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Let me escort you there[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                               
I kneel before you, kiss your hand to[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]        
Tell you I'm a lucky guy[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]  
Look back and know that I can heal your tired heart[/tab]

What a crime, such a breath-taking crime
Everything I touch can't help but fall in love
In this cruel romantic game, there's no way that you're to blame
For your stolen heart
So I say that the price I must pay
Is to offer up my heart forever
Just don't take away your touch 'cause it means so much
To feel your hand in mine
Guilty, Beauty, Love

In the sky, you and I
Are floating in space
I the moon, you the sun
Locked in beautiful embrace
Heavenly bodies come together so blindingly bright
They chase away the night

What I bring you, I hope delights you
A bouquet of passion, Cutie Lady
Be sure that here with me you'll always save the day

What a crime, such a wonderful crime
That God would choose to make such lips as mine
It was wrong but all the same, I invited and you came
Into this dream with me
So my price is to gaze in your eyes
And to feel more love than I can contain
Even so, it's fair to say, I've still found a way
To cast my spell on you
Guilty, Beauty, Heart

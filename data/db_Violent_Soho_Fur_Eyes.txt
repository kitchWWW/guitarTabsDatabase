[Verse]
Stay up all night so dark I get warm with you Yeah
Drunks in the street making video game noise
Dust in the city blew into my eyes I get high with you Yeah
Claws digging deeper and deeper into the earth

[Chorus]
Hum at night that feels so right
It heals my eyes and leads a cavalcade
Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes don't feel the earth move
Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes don't feel the earth move
Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes don't feel the earth move
Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes don't feel the earth move

[Outro]
Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes Fur eyes
So right it leads a cavalcade
Fur eyes Fur eyes
So right it leads a cavalcade
Fur eyes Fur eyes
So right it leads a cavalcade
Fur eyes Fur eyes
So right it leads a cavalcade
Fur eyes Fur eyes
Fur eyes Fur eyes
So right it leads a cavalcade

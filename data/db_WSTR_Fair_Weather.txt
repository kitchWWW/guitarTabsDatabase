[Intro]
[ch]C#[/ch] [ch]F#[/ch] (x3)

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch] [ch]F#[/ch]
Another wasted year[/tab]

So fucking plain around here
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
Another summer moping with my peers[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]                      [ch]Fm[/ch]
Don't care what the old man say[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
Must suck to be old and grey[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
Rounding up the troops is not so easy these days[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]
Out with the old in with the new[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
Max our banks forget rents due[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#[/ch]
That's just the way we are[/tab]

That's just the way we are
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]
Never had a fucking clue[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
Never had a thing to do[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
Raised by wolves an understatement by far[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
And at the end of the day[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                                                    [ch]A#m[/ch]
My friends are dicks but I wouldn't have it any other way[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
Living life faster can end in disaster[/tab]

[ch]C#[/ch] [ch]F#[/ch] (x3)

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
Wasted the same old story[/tab]

Fucked up my priorities
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
Chin two last cigarettes and scramble for a taxi[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
Hit the bar[/tab]

Get some drinks

Even though we're feeling rough
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
Go find girls[/tab]

Strut our stuff

But never gain any luck

[Bridge 1]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
Long walks late nights[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C#[/ch]
We'd always find a street light[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
Try to piece together why we'd always had a shit time[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]              [ch]C#[/ch]
But nevertheless I would never change that[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#[/ch]
Cause that was how we rolled[/tab]

It will be til we're old

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]C#[/ch]
And at the end of the day[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                                                    [ch]A#m[/ch]
My friends are dicks but I wouldn't have it any other way[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
Living life faster can end in disaster[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
All moved on we all got older[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]
Football shirts or suits and ties[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A#m[/ch]                               [ch]G#[/ch]
The safety net you built yourself was made with silk and lies[/tab]

[ch]A#m[/ch] [ch]F#[/ch] (x2)

[Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]C#[/ch]
And at the end of the day[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                                                    [ch]F#[/ch]
My friends are dicks but I wouldn't have it any other way[/tab]

Cause that was how we rolled, it will be til we're old

[ch]C#[/ch]

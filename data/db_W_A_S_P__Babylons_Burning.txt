Babylon's Burning

[ch]Ab[/ch] [ch]C#[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch]

[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
Listen close to hooves you hear[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Are thunders coming dread[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
John the Revelator's dream[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C#[/ch]
Had seen a terror vision[/tab]
Of the spirit led
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
With wrath to reign[/tab]
And with slaves to flame
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]
They kneeled and sealed a kiss[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
Plagues and pain and fiery rain[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C#[/ch]               [ch]Eb[/ch]
And blaspheme on his lips[/tab]

[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]                   [ch]C#[/ch]
Babylon's a-burning, Babylon's a-burning[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
Six hundred 6, 6 and 7 seals[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
A pale rider and his horses sing[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]                   [ch]C#[/ch]
Babylon's a-burning, Babylon's a-burning[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
Six hundred 6, 6 the rising beast[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
Bears the mark of Babylon to be[/tab]

Arising with the beast a sea of men
A bloody moon of red
A whore of Babylon to bleed the seed
And make 'em take the mark upon their heads

They bowed and kneeled a mark to seal
Their souls unto a kiss
With fire and flames and with
Souls to claim
And rise from the abyss

solo verse + chorus

[Revelation 13]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
And I stood upon the sand of the sea[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
And saw a beast rise out of the sea[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
Having ten horns and seven heads[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
Ten crowns upon his head[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
Who is like unto the beast?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
Given his mouth great things to speak[/tab]
[tab][ch]Eb[/ch]
If any man has an ear[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ab[/ch]
Let him hear, let him hear[/tab]

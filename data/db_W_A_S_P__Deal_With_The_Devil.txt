[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I heard the rhythm[/tab]
I was rocking at two
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I had the Rock & Roll Blues[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I had a vision[/tab]
Down at the crossroads
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
To give the Devil the news[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Gimme a name[/tab]
And all the hell I can raise
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
No I had nothing to lose[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
I wanted fame but now[/tab]
The price that you claim's oh
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
My soul be given to you[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]
Cause I won't make no deal[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]
With the Devil tonight[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]
No I won't make no deal[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]
To give him my life[/tab]
Cause I won't make no deal
With the Devil tonight
No I won't make no deal
To give him my life

I got a pain and I
I got a band
The road to paying my dues

A million times he shoved that
Dotted line at me
To sing away my Blues

Oh, the pen he had
Had my blood on his hands
For all Eternity too

Don't sell your soul to
No Rock & Roll Crossroads
He'll come collecting his due

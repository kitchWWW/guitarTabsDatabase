Song: Meet Me In The Bathroom
Genre: 
Key: 


[Verse 1]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
It's our last chance for a one night stand[/tab]

Before I meet somebody else or runaway with the band
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]
Then I'll board a private jet plane just to see where it lands[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]A[/ch]
Will you write a tear soaked letter we can tear it up together, again?[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
It's the wrong day to lie awake in the sand[/tab]

Then we lose ourselves for days until we don't understand
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]
Set a fire to all the letters as we burn all the plans[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
The words all turn to ash like a fire in my hand, again[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Meet me in the bathroom[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
Underneath a crescent moon[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Meet me in the back of the van, we'll make a plan[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]D[/ch]
And we can skip town just to see where we land[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Meet me in the bathroom[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
Underneath a crescent moon[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Meet me in the back of the van, we'll make a plan[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]D[/ch]
And we can skip town just to see where we land[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
You're stood there in the doorway with your back turned to me[/tab]

Then you go to check the time I say its quarter to three
[tab]             [ch]Bm[/ch]
Could you be somebody else? You can do what you please[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]A[/ch]
You go to get the car but I don't want to leave again[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Walking down the hallway, I don't know how to be[/tab]

I could be another planet or be lost with the sea
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]
I'm moving from your breath because it's so close to me[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
And telling you some lies that you just wouldn't believe again[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Meet me in the bathroom[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
Underneath a crescent moon[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Meet me in the back of the van, we'll make a plan[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]D[/ch]
And we can skip town just to see where we land[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Meet me in the bathroom[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
Underneath a crescent moon[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Meet me in the back of the van, we'll make a plan[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]D[/ch]
And we can skip town just to see where we land[/tab]

[ch]D[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
[ch]D[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]

Underneath a crescent moon[/tab]

Meet me in the back of the van, we'll make a plan[/tab]

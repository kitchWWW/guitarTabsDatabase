Get out, I never thought it was you, my world's collapsing on me         [/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch] 
This is what we were for you     [/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]Em[/ch]

Vandalise and paralyse him, and manipulate him, my mistakes  [/tab]

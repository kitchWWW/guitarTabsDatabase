[Intro]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                    [ch]C[/ch]
Well, I slipped out the back door as the ambulance arrived[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                            [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
I would've liked to tell 'em my story, but I know I would've lied[/tab]
[tab]                                                             [ch]C[/ch]
So I pawned my sister's diamond ring, got on the Greyhound's back[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
I figured with a little leeway I might just get on track[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I'm just trying to stay out of harm's way[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I'm just trying to stay out of harm's way[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Hey![/tab]

By the time I got to Chicago, I thought I had something to sell[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
But the deal fell through as they always do[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
C'est la vie, what the hell[/tab]
[tab]                                                      [ch]C[/ch]
Every time I think of my baby working in that old coalmine[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
I feel so goddamn guilty, I almost change my mind[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I'm just trying to stay out of harm's way[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
And I'm just trying to stay out of harm's way[/tab]

Key: 


[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I drink coffee in the kitchen[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Cadd9[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
As she slams the bedroom door[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cadd9[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
She had enough of me[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
And she sure did let me know[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Cadd9[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Oh the silence spoke out loud and clear[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
Heard a tear hit the floor from here[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Cadd9[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Oh I can sure feel my stubborn ways[/tab]

chorus:
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Oh the things I do to prove I'm right[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
Break her heart just to watch her cry[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Cadd9[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Leave her stranded on an island all alone[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I cant stand it when I'm wrong[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]Em[/ch]
Being right aint worth the cost[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Cadd9[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
Because sometimes a battle won is a battle lost[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
You always tell me that you love me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cadd9[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
With conviction in your eyes[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Cadd9[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
You're my best friend, my biggest fan [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
You were always on my side[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Cadd9[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
And the more I sit here all alone[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]Em7[/ch]     
The more this sad disgrace runs through my bones[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Cadd9[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
It cuts just deep enough to realize[/tab]

chorus

[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
Well nobody in the world really wants to lose[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cadd9[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah but whats the point admitting[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
If I can't win with you[/tab]

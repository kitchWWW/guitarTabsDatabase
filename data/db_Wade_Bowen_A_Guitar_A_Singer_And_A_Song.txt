As recorded by Wade Bowen feat. Vince Gill

[Intro]
[ch]E[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
A guitar won't change the world[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]B[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
But there's nights that I feel like it has[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]A[/ch]
A singer can't put lonely in a song[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
Until he's felt lonely like that[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]
Callused fingers, a poured out heart[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]B[/ch]
And a dream much harder than you ever thought[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]B7[/ch]
Oh, I don't know why I do what I do[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
I just know that I'm in right or wrong[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]B7[/ch]
Somewhere in these chords lies the truth[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
For a guitar, a singer and a song[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
Well, it's not always gonna rhyme[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]B[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
And sometimes it won't be in tune[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]A[/ch]
And the damn thing will keep you up at night[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]B[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]
You think you're singing the song but the song's singing you[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]B7[/ch]
Oh, I don't know why I do what I do[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
I just know that I'm in right or wrong[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]B7[/ch]
Somewhere in these chords lies the truth[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
For a guitar, a singer and a song[/tab]


[Guitar Solo]
[ch]E[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]
[ch]A[/ch]  [ch]B[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
So I'll write you a thousand songs[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B7[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
And I'll play you a thousand shows[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
It'll feel like a thousand years[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]B7[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
Some will remember me and some won't[/tab]


[Out-Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]B7[/ch]
But I know why I do what I do[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
Oh and I'm in till the day that I'm gone[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]B7[/ch]
And I pray when they speak my name[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C#m[/ch]
That I live on[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]B[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]
Oh, in a guitar, a singer and a song[/tab]

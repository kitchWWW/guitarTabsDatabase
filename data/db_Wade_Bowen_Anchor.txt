[Intro] 
[ch]D[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You kiss me like I'm an old habit[/tab]
My name's familiar on your lips
It's not like you've gotta have it
It's more like you got used to it
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'm not a man in desperation[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
I'm just a man who can't forget[/tab]
What passion feels like when it's raging
What love feels like without an end

[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
We know eachother's every weakness[/tab]
Sometimes our love's like a battlefield
I bite my tongue to hide the honest
You use your tears like a sword and shield
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
And I wonder if you ever miss it[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Or if you itch for someone else[/tab]
I don't wanna think about it ending
But I don't wanna stay here by myself

[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
I know I'm your solid ground[/tab]
I know I'm your settle down
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
But I miss those days when I could put[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
Your head in the clouds[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Sometimes I wonder if our vow[/tab]
Is all that's keeping you here now
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
Am I an anchor or just a rock[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
You gotta drag around[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, drag around[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You kiss me like I'm an old habit[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F/C[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]F/C[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]F/C[/ch]
Well, the music was sad[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]F/C[/ch]
The widow was all dressed in black and we sang[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Told stories all about the good ole days[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F/C[/ch]                                     [ch]C[/ch]
There were hugs to give and a few more tears to cry[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F/C[/ch]                                        [ch]C[/ch]
Then we closed the lid and we gave him one last ride[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F/C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
And we laid him in the ground And headed back to town[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
There were casseroles and pecan pies[/tab]
[tab][ch]F/C[/ch]
Mama's sweet tea and beer on ice[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
Hell of a way to say goodbye I guess[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Preacher cleared his throat and then he said[/tab]
[tab][ch]F/C[/ch]
Everybody bow your heads[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]
And just like that everything was blessed[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]F/C[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]
So here's to death, dyin' and deviled eggs[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]F/C[/ch]
Yeah such is life[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]F/C[/ch]
We're all at the mercy of a butter knife on a plate[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Checkered table cloth and "I'll Fly Away"[/tab]
[tab][ch]F/C[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
Keep in mind that it always ends the same[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F/C[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
And there's no love like no potluck left to save[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]F/C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
And they'll lay you in the ground    And all head back to town[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]

[tab] [ch]F/C[/ch]
Mama's sweet tea and beer on ice[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
Hell of a way to say goodbye I guess[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Preacher cleared his throat and then he says[/tab]
[tab][ch]F/C[/ch]

[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]

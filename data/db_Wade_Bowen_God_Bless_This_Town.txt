[Intro]
[ch]E[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
You just thought you knew about rumors man[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
But you aint ever lived in my town[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Population 153[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
And its still goin' down[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
What's his name's still runnin' around with Mary[/tab]
[tab]                                              [ch]E[/ch]
Hell last I heard he'd already been married 3 times[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]
You've been gone for what, about 8 years now[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
And they're still spreading rumors about you[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
You grew your hair long and shaggy[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
And gettin' drunk is all that you do[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
They forgot that you play your music[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]E[/ch]
Yeah they gave up on you a long time ago[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
God bless this town[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
It's so good to be back home[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, how you been doin'[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
Lord, I know it's been so long[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
Tell your family hello[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]
I'm sure I'll see you around[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F#m[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
Be sure to close the doors and lock 'em up[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E[/ch]
God bless this town[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Small towns are supposed to be small[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Until being big gets in the way[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
A man doesn't play by their rules[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Then he's not welcome to stay[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
And politics don't care about 21 years of service[/tab]
[tab]                                        [ch]E[/ch]
Being a puppet is something he'll never be[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
God bless this town[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
It's so good to be back home[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, how you been doin'[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
Lord, I know it's been so long[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
Tell your family hello[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]
I'm sure I'll see you around[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F#m[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]

I guess that's all you ever do[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Soon I'll find my place[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
And I'll wave as I pass through[/tab]

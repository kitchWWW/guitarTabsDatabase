[V.1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
That voice in your head's too loud[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
and you can't drown it out[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
You got your doubts[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I ain't gonna plead, girl,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
I ain't gonna beg you to stay[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
Gonna love you either way[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Last thing I want is to watch you leave[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
But if that's what you need[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
Pack your bags, hit the road[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Drive that Chevy like it's something you stole[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
Maybe you were right[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]
Maybe this is wrong[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
It ain't worth the fight[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
If you don't miss me when you're gone[/tab]


[V.2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I don't need your sympathy[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
I don't need to see any tears[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
You don't wanna be here[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
'Til you know what you want,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
What you want ain't being alone[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]
Then just stay gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
If giving all I've got hadn't changed your mind[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
Then why even try?[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
Pack your bags, hit the road[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Drive that Chevy like it's something you stole[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]
Maybe you were right[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]
Maybe this is wrong[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
It ain't worth the fight[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
If you don't miss me when you're gone[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
If you think in all that kickin' up dust[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
I still won't be enough[/tab]

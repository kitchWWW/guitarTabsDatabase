[Intro]
[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D/F#[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]Cadd9[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch] 

[Verse]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
You heard that I was taking it bad[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
All of this talk will drive you mad[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
They say they saw the writing on the wall[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Before we even had a chance to fall[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Well there's nothing left to worry about[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Let everyone else try to figure it out[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
They're gonna say what they wanna say[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
Only you and I know what really happened that day[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D/F#[/ch]
When you told me that I wasn't the one[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]            
And I agreed it was time to run away[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
From everything that we had[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]D/F#[/ch] 
You drove away with tears in your eyes[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
The only thing left to say was goodbye[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
We threw away everything that we'd found[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Cadd9[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
And it's all    over  town [/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Somebody said you were takin it rough[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
But I stepped right in and called their bluff[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
You're stronger than you want to believe[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
When they say that you'll never get over me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
We don't have to think this through[/tab]
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
They don't have to walk in our shoes[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I think I finally had enough of [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Everybody guessing why we gave up[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D/F#[/ch]
When you told me that I wasn't the one[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]            
And I agreed it was time to run away[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
From everything that we had[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]D/F#[/ch] 
You drove away with tears in your eyes[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
The only thing left to say was goodbye[/tab]

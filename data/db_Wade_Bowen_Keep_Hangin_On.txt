[Verse 1]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
Well I love that girl with all my heart[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah I loved her more than anything[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
But she told me yesterday to get the hell away[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I hope that was something she didn’t mean[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Well last week I tried to kiss her[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah, it seemed like the right thing to do[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
But she slapped me across the face and we went our separate ways[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I turned around and screamed I still love you[/tab]

[Chorus 1]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Cause there’s a long list of reasons[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Why I keep hangin’ on[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
I hope you all can see just what she’s doing to me[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I'm tired of her always treating me wrong[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
I tried to call her on the phone[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
Just hoping we could talk a little more[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
She didn’t like that at all she hung up and blocked my calls[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
And now I can’t reach her anymore[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
She went out with some other guy[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
I tried not to let it bother me[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
Took the wind right outta my sails, I got drunk and got in jail[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
And now I'm as lonely as I can be[/tab]

[Chorus 2]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
Cause there’s a long list of reasons[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Why I keep hangin’ on[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
I think I’ll sit right here and drink another beer[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
Until the early morning dawn[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
I got out of jail and saw her on the street[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
I tried so hard to wave her down[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
She just hopped into her truck, hit the gas and off the clutch[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
She flipped me off as she was leaving town[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
Well she packed up and she moved far away[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
My friends say it was all because of me[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
I don’t think that’s true, I’ll see her again real soon[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
Cause I found out that she moved out to Abilene[/tab]

[Chorus 3]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
Cause there’s a long list of reasons[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Why I keep hangin’ on[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
I think I’ll sit right here and keep on drinkin’ them beers[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
Until the early morning dawn[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah I think I’ll sit right here[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
And keep on drinkin’ them beers[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Until the early morning dawn[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]C[/ch]


[Verse]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
It makes me get in my truck at 3am[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
And drive by your house[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Am[/ch]
Just to wonder who's sleeping with you now[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]Am[/ch]
It makes me pace the floor a thousand times[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
Til it's worn itself out[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]Am[/ch]
It makes me say your name even though I'm not allowed[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]
I keep trying to say no[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
But it's out of my control[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
It won't give up and it won't forget[/tab]

And it wants to smoke a Marlboro red
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Stay up all night and cry about[/tab]

How we lost you

[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
It's too damn strong and it's too damn tough[/tab]

No matter what I drink it won't get drunk
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
It's like living with the shadow of a hard truth[/tab]

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
No it don't matter[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
What I do[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]G/B[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
Love does what it wants to[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]G/B[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
Love does what it wants to[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
It won't let me take your damn number off of my phone[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                                    [ch]AM[/ch]
It won't get it through it's head that you're gone[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]
It turns up every sad song[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
And it turns over every stone[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
It'll make you think it's leaving but it don't[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]
It don't let me move on[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
And it don't leave me alone[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
It won't give up and it won't forget[/tab]

And it wants to smoke a Marlboro red
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Stay up all night and cry about[/tab]

How we lost you

[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
It's too damn strong and it's too damn tough[/tab]

No matter what I drink it won't get drunk
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
It's like living with the shadow of a hard truth[/tab]

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]
No it don't matter[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
What I do[/tab]

[tab]                   [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]G/B[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
Love does what it wants to[/tab]

 [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]G/B[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]


[Break]
[tab]    [ch]Dm[/ch]
It does what it wants to[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]
It's stubborn as hell[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
And I hate that it wants you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
And it don't want no one else[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
It won't give up and it won't forget[/tab]

And it wants to smoke a Marlboro red
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
Stay up all night and cry about[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
How we lost you[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]
It's too damn strong and it's too damn tough[/tab]

No matter what I drink it won't get drunk
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
It's like living with the shadow of a hard truth[/tab]

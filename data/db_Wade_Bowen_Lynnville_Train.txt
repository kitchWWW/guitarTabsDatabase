[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
The lonesome oak tree held its fire into November[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                     
He watched the last brown leaf[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Hit the ground and blow a way[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                          [ch]D[/ch]
An evening gunshot lets him know the hunt is over[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                      
A familiar cold moves in[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Some where between snow and rain[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch] 
Just last spring you know his heart was burning[/tab]

Before his Lynnville love hit the road to chase her dream[/tab]

Now he thinks of her each night and in the morning[/tab]

CHORUS

[tab] [ch]C[/ch]
Her story is she's changed her mind[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]   
She just can't help herself[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                          
She wrote please don't meet me at the Lynnville train[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Cause I'm coming in with someone else[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]
He's a quiet man, the neighbors say[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]G/F[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
But his pain won't go a way[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
So for better or worse he's going down[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
To meet the Lynnville train[/tab]

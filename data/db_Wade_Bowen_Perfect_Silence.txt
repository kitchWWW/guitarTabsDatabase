[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I often wonder in my mind[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
If I've made a mistake[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Cause your soft spoken spirit[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
Seems it's had all it can take[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Then you look at me and smile[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
That's all you have to do[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Your eyes tell me everything[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
And I no longer worry about you[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
I love to dream about you and how quiet you love to be[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Girl your perfect silence is perfect to me[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I watch you walk into a room[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You never have too much to say[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I guess it's in the way you move[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Girl it just carries me away[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
I may never know why, why you happened to me[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
I may never understand how you set me free[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
I love to dream about you and how quiet you love to be[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Girl, your perfect silence is perfect to me[/tab]

[ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I must have done something right[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
To get to stare at you every day[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
All my hopes, dreams, and love[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]D[/ch]
The things you ask for when you pray[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
You've captured all that I am[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Mind, body and soul[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
The way that you do everything[/tab]
                      (no chord)
Without even saying a word

[tab][ch]D[/ch]   (build up)   [ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
I may never know why, why you happened to me[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
I may never understand how you set me free[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
I love to dream about you and how quiet you love to be[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Girl, your perfect silence is perfect to me[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah girl, your perfect silence is so perfect to me[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]A[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Number twenty-five got his jersey up high[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
In that mechanic shop down on main[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
There's no stopping when ya get him talking[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
'Bout the play that took 'em to state[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F#m[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
I can almost see it as his eyes light up[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Right with him in the glory days[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
Some boys went to college, some went to war[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
He stayed around to make the keys crank[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
These city limits[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
Are the people in it[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]F#m[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
It's amazing grace that's found[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
In this main-street sacred ground[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
And a band playing on a Friday night[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Team lined up on the 50 yard line[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
With the fans in the stands making the sweetеst sounds[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
And that's the secret to this town[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
Thе girl next door just turned twenty-four[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
And now she's married and she got a kid[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
She used to daydream about the day she'd leave[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Now she's glad as hell she never did[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
Now it's hurry up and wait and baseball games[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
And a home-by-supper-time kiss[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]
Sometimes got it made is a life you wouldn't trade[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause there ain't much better than this[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
These city limits[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
Are the people in it[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]F#m[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
It's amazing grace that's found[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
In this main-street sacred ground[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Working your hands 'til they bleed[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Just to make sure you got all you need[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#m[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Fallin' into the arms of the one you love when you lay it down[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]
That's the secret to this town[/tab]

It's a place to come back to[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Where everybody really knows you[/tab]


[Out-Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]F#m[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
It's amazing grace that's found[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
In this main-street sacred ground[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Made-from-scratch potluck table[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Always give when you're able[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#m[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Take a piece of it no matter where you're bound[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#m[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Yeah all you gotta do is just look around[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]D[/ch]

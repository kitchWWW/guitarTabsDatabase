[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
I wouldn’t say I didn’t see her comin[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                [ch]D[/ch]
A light that bright hard to miss in a place that dark[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                               [ch]C[/ch]        
She said yes to a drink, while her fingers fumbled[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                        [ch]D[/ch]
With a cross on a chain that was swinging above her heart[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                    [ch]G[/ch]
When the morning sun set the midnight sky on fire[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                  [ch]D[/ch]
She left me like a thief not knowing what she took[/tab]

Chorus
[tab]         [ch]EM[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
I wish trouble always looked that good[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]EM[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
I wish trouble always looked that good[/tab]


I was still a little nervous when I got the courage to call

That bright red number she’d written on the back of my hand

A bottle of wine rode shotgun with a rose

While I was drivin cross town, thinking bout turning back

Now there’s a porch light burnin a hole right through my windshield

There’s a silhouette standing at the screen door waitin for me.

Chorus 
[tab]         [ch]EM[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
I wish trouble always looked that good[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]EM[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
I wish trouble always looked that good[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                        [ch]G[/ch]
Now there’s a million reason’s not for me to go all in[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, but when she smiles I can’t even think of one[/tab]

Repeat Chorus

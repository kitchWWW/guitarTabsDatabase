[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
It's not easy anymore, everything seemed to change[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
In one blink of an eye, I'm the man to lay the blame[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]Am[/ch]
I let you slip away, tried so hard to make this right[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I have nothing left to do, nowhere else to turn[/tab]

[tab]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
And I know it's dark, babe[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Please turn on the lights[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]
Let me see you crying[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
You're not here alone[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F[/ch]
I'm in here with you trying[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
I wanna see the truth[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
And find the broken pieces[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]
We can make it right but you have to, you have to[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
  turn on the lights[/tab]

[Verse 2]
We can step into the sun, kiss the night goodbye
Those things that hold you down, cut 'em loose and fly
So keep reaching for my hand, might be hard for you to see
When shadows fill the room, baby I won't let you go

And I know it's dark, babe

[Chorus]
Please turn on the lights
Let me see you crying
You're not here alone
I'm in here with you trying
I wanna see the truth and find the broken pieces
We can make it right but you have to, you have to turn on the lights

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
Please don't be afraid, girl it's only me[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah, I am here to help you[/tab]

[Chorus]
Turn on the lights
Let me see you crying
You're not here alone
I'm in here with you trying
I wanna see the truth and find the broken pieces
We can make it right but you have to, you have to turn on the lights

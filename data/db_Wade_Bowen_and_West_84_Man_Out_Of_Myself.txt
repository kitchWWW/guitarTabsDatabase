[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
He was 18 years of age, born to a dirt poor family[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
In the middle of the Texas plains, no matter how hard he tried[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
He couldn't seem to please the young man staring back from the broken mirror[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]
So he packed his bags one night to go out and make it on his own[/tab]


[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
As he traveled down that dusty drive, he took a glance in the rearview mirror[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
He saw the shadow standing there[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
And watched his father wave[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
As if he seemed to say good luck son in everything you do[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
We hope to see you soon[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
I don't know where I'm going in my life[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]C/B[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch]
But I've got to find my way in this world[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
I've done all that I can do here[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]C/B[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
There's so much left for me to do[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]C/B[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
I don't really know if I'm doing the right[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
I'm gonna make a man out of myself if it kills me[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Am[/ch]
You gotta make your dreams come true[/tab]


[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
He pulled into the city bright lights all around[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
Cars flying by his old beat up truck[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Am[/ch]
Yeah he's doubting himself a little but he knows he can't turn back[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]Am[/ch]
For the man he used to be is already gone there's nothing left for him back home[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
So he got a cheap apartment, spent his nights making cocktails[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
At a local bar that was just right up the street[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]
It was 3 o'clock in the morning all the wanted was the tips he made that night[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]                                           [ch]Am[/ch]
But the country boy refused much to their surprise, they left him laying there in the street[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
I don't know where I'm going in my life[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]C/B[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
But I've got to find my way in this world[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
I've done all that I can do here[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]C/B[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
There's so much left for me to do[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]C/B[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]
I don't really know if I'm doing the right thing[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
I'm gonna make a man out of myself if it kills me[/tab]
[tab]                                         [ch]Am[/ch]
You gotta make your dreams come true[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
His parents got a knock at the door the very next afternoon[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]
It was a young woman wearing a red t-shirt and jeans[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
She said I'm your son's wife and this here's your grandson[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
And here's a letter he never got around to mailing you, I just thought you both should know[/tab]

(And that letter said)


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I finally know where my life's headed to[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]C/B[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
And I've finally found my place in this world[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
I've done all that I know to do[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]C/B[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
And I owe it all to what you put me through[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]C/B[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
I just got married and I've got a son[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]
Dad I named him after you[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]Am[/ch]
And I've made all my dreams come true[/tab]

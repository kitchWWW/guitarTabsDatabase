[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
There's a lot of things, that I could do tonight[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Call up some old friends, just to see if they're alright[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
I could read a book, maybe somethin by Louie Lamore[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]  
Oh but I don't feel like doin that at all[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
I could play guitar, maybe write a song[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch] 
Somethin really inspirational that everybody could sing along[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
I could build a fire, and watch it burn all night long[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Oh but I don't feel like doin that at all[/tab]


Chorus:
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]
Yea I feel like lovin you[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
I feel like holdin you close[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
I feel like lookin in your eyes[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]   
Baby you're the one I want most[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]  
So why can't I have you anymore[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]G/F#[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]
Why did you have to leave[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
Why can't I pick up and just move on[/tab]


I could smoke a cigarette, maybe drink a beer
Turn on the radio, see if they're playin somethin I wanna hear
Try to find me a woman but everything just seems so hard
Cause I don't feel like doin anything at all

Chorus

There's a lot of things, that I could do tonight
But I'm so heart broken doin nothin just feels so right
And I know it may sound crazy to just sit and listen to the rain fall
Cause I don't feel like doin anything at all

No I don't feel like doin anything at all
No I don't feel like doin anything, anything at all

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Met her in a bar[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, how I remember that day[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Beer was flowing off tap[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
And I was the drunkest there I'd say[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
Pretty little woman who left me high and dry[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Who took my ass home because I was in no state to drive[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Back at her place[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
I found a six string there[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
She said, do you play[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
I said, only if you care[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
We played all damn night until we found the morning sun[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
She went off to work and I almost died from all the rum[/tab]

[ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
But if I was a dreamer and little bit better with words[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
I wouldn't be running away from that damn girl[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
And if I weren't a cowboy then I probably would've stayed[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
But these roads here look so damn good to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]*
    Nearly meant to be[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Met her back at school[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
I thought that she was great[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Every time I talked to her[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
She had a smile across her face[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Dunno why, why she'd ever love me so[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
But just of being country I had to let her go[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Days rolled into night[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
And my heart still thought of her[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Never gonna forgive myself[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
For what I did to her[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
She's nearly married now, I shouldn't have to feel so bad[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
She's got that same damn smile, the same damn one I had[/tab]

[ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
But if I was a dreamer and little bit better with words[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
I wouldn't be running away from that damn girl[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
And if I weren't a cowboy then I probably would've stayed[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
But these roads here look so damn good to me[/tab]

[Verse 5]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]*
I have made mistakes[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]*        [ch]A[/ch]*     [ch]D[/ch]*
I'm sure that we all have[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]*
One day I'll feel[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]*      [ch]A[/ch]*      [ch]D[/ch]*

A white picket fence and some kids left for the loving[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
A letter to those special girls who made me feel like something[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Can't seem to find me a better option[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Bm[/ch]
Start with deleting you from my concoction[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Cause this drink here is too damn strong[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
Blocked you all on my social media[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Deleted your number because if I think of you i'll probably say I need ya[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
Caught a greyhound westbound for nowhere[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]Bm[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Don't even care because when you left this town you're out of my damn hair[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]A[/ch]
You'd mix your drink with prescription pills[/tab]

That I know you stole from Will's
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
And I'll never understand how that's ever gonna be fun[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
But you're just a rolling stone[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
Still looking for a home[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
And you'll come back soon[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
Wild As a monsoon[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
And you're just a small-town girl[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Who will never fight the demons[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
So you blame them on something from out here[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Maybe if I stayed around for a while[/tab]

I might have got to like that smile
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
The one that reeks of rum and JPS[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
And when I bought that new guitar[/tab]

You wrapped it around my car
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
When I said I might leave this town and not come back[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
You helped me pack on my front lawn[/tab]

It rained down even more
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Then the rain in the middle of the flood of 2019[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
Jokes on you because I called the landlord[/tab]

He's gonna lock that door
[tab]   [ch]Bm[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
No women are staying High, drunk, Dirty and off-tap[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
I hope this letter finds you well[/tab]

I'm not praying on a wishing well
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]*                         [ch]A[/ch]*                     [ch]D[/ch]*
Hell, I don't give two damn fucks if you listen to this[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
But you're just a rolling stone[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
Still looking for a home[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
And you'll come back soon[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
Wild As a monsoon[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
And you're just a small-town girl[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Who will never fight the demons[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch]
So you blame them on something from out here[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Oh you blame them on something from out here[/tab]

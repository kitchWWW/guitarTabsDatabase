N.C.
This is not another rodeo it's the greatest rodeo in the world.
N.C.
Yeah, it is the greatest rodeo, and anything can happen and it's much too early to predict anything.
N.C.
We'll be right back with the action after we pause for this word.

N.C.

Everybody has gotta be clean And, we're clean again, take it.
N.C.
Add seven and a quarter, you're hot boys.

[Verse]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
I walked out tonight on the woman I love[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                       [ch]C#[/ch]           [ch]F#[/ch]
We had us a fight and I said I had e nough[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]B[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]
I slammed the door and headed for, a place I used to go[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                [ch]F#[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
For a taste of freedom with some friends I used to know[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]E[/ch]
They had that jukebox rockin', the music turned up loud[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                     [ch]C#[/ch]           [ch]F#[/ch]
I thought I'd fit right back in, with my old party crowd[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
But, now I can't remember what I came here to find[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                  [ch]F#[/ch]
I've been here all night, with one question on my mind[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]B[/ch]
Are we having fun yet[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E7[/ch]
Right now it's hard to tell[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]
It don't feel that good[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F#[/ch]
This heartache hurts like hell[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]B[/ch]
I think we might've made a big mistake[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]
Is this as good as good times get[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]F#[/ch]
I'm down to my last dime, it's closing time[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]B[/ch]
Are we having fun yet[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]  [ch]B[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
I bet she's watching TV now, in my favorite chair[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                           [ch]C#[/ch]            [ch]F#[/ch]
While I ride this barstool, wishin' I was there[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                [ch]E[/ch]
In my wildest dreams, this ain't how it's supposed to be[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                            [ch]F#[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]
Sitting here, missing her... asking my old friends[/tab]

[Chorus/Outro]
[tab]              [ch]B[/ch]
Are we having fun yet[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]E7[/ch]
Right now it's hard to tell[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]
It don't feel that good[/tab]

This heartache hurts like hell[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]B[/ch]
I think we might've made a big mistake[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]
Is this as good as good times get[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]F#[/ch]

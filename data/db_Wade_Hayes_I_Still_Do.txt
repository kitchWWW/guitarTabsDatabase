[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                [ch]B[/ch]
Last night when I touched you it brought back memories[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]B[/ch]
Of the way it felt the first time I held you close to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                 [ch]B[/ch]
I gave you my heart and swore I'd always love you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]
And I still do[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]B[/ch]
And when I closed my eyes you were waiting there[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]B[/ch]
Standing in the moonlight with the wind in your hair[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                  [ch]B[/ch]
You said there would come a time I wouldn't dream of you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]
But I still do[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]C#m[/ch]                       [ch]B[/ch]
And I still wake up every morning and I thank God above[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#m[/ch]                             [ch]B[/ch]
That of all the people on this earth he gave me you to love[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]                         [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
Don't you know my heart and soul belong to you[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]B[/ch]
I swear it's true[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                   [ch]B[/ch]
So when you ask if I still need you after all this time[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]B[/ch]
I can't believe that thought would ever cross your mind[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                      [ch]B[/ch]
The answer's so simple I just thought you knew[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]
I still do[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]
I still do [/tab]

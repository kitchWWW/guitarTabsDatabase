[tab][ch]E[/ch]                              [ch]B[/ch]
I'm sittin' here surrounded by people I know[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                     [ch]B[/ch]
The beer is cold and the music's good and loud[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]B[/ch]
That used to be enough to put a smile on my face[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]E[/ch]
But tonight I just feel lost in this crowd[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                            [ch]B[/ch]
There's a brunette on the dance floor that's smiled a time or two[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]B[/ch]
So I got up and asked her for a dance[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                         [ch]B[/ch]
But when she put her arms around me and I held her I knew[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
It was just too soon to take another chance[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
'Cause I'm still dancing with you[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]         [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
I know we said we were through[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]C#m[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
But I keep holdin' on letting go is just too hard to do[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
Even when I'm holdin' someone new, I'm still dancing with you.[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                             [ch]B[/ch]
When the song was over I held on a little longer[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]B[/ch]
Deep inside I knew that it was wrong[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]B[/ch]
I could hold her in my arms for the rest of the night[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
But I'd just be leading her on[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
'Cause I'm still dancing with you[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]         [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
I know we said we were through[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]C#m[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
But I keep holdin' on letting go is just too hard to do[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
Even when I'm holdin' someone new, I'm still dancing with you[/tab]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
Even when I'm holdin' someone new, I'm still dancing with you[/tab]

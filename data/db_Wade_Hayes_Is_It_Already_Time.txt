[tab][ch]A[/ch]
We'll know something Thursday[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
That's what the doctors said[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
We'll see what we're dealing with[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
We'll see how far it spread[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Now just go home[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]E[/ch]
And try to get some rest[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I made it to the truck[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Staring in the rear view [/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
How you're supposed to take it[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
When you get that kind of news?[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
Just hold on[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]E[/ch]
And wait for some damn test[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]E[/ch]
Nothing I could say or do right then could change a thing[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]E[/ch]
So I sat there alone, wonderin'[/tab]

Chorus

[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Is it already time?[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
Time to move along[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Have I lived my life?[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]A[/ch]
Have I written my last song?[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Is this really real?[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
Have I reached the end of the line?[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
Is it already time?[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
And I got me thinkin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
How fast the years have flown[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Sure I might've done[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
A few things different had I known[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
I might not get[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]E[/ch]                    
A chance to make repairs[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Just yesterday[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I was still a kid[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Now I'm over forty[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
But too young to be facin' this[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
But no one yet[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]E[/ch]
Has told me life was fair[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                [ch]E[/ch]
My faith can move a mountain and cast it in the sea[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]E[/ch]
Jesus will I find that mustard seed?[/tab]

Chorus
[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Is it already time?[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
Time to move along[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Have I lived my life?[/tab]
[tab]                                    [ch]A[/ch]
Have I written my last song?[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Is this really real?[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
Have I reached the end of the line?[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
Is it already time?[/tab]

[tab]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
Cause there's so many things I need to do[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
And things I need to say[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]
So many precious moments[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
That I've let get away[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Dear Lord, give me resolution[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
If indeed I mean to say goodbye[/tab]

[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Is this really real?[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
Have I reached the end of the line?[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Is it already time?[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
Is it already time?[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
We'll know something Thursday[/tab]

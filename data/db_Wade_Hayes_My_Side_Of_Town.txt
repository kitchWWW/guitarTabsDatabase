[Intro] 

[ch]G[/ch] 

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Well I heard it through the grapevine[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
I guess it must be true[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]G[/ch]
I heard that crowd you're running with[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Has changed your attitude[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
It's been a month of Sundays[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Since you've been around[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
But you always had a good time[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
On my side of town[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I knew that you were born to[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]C[/ch]
The finer things in life[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Caviar and foreign cars and bright big city lights[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Now you're out there dancin'[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
In a fancy evening gown[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
But you always had a good time[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
On my side of town[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Don't forget the one who really loves you[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
When the glamour starts to let you down[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And I'll be right there waitin'[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
'Til you come back around[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause you always had a good time[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
On my side of town[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I still dream about you[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Every time the music starts[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]
I still hold you close to me[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Even though we're far apart[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
If I ever cross your mind[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
You know where I'm found[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause you always had a good time[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
On my side of town[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Don't forget the one who really loves you[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]D[/ch]
When the glamour starts to let you down[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
And I'll be right there waitin'[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
'Til you come back around[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause you always had a good time[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
On my side of town[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
You always had a good time[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
On my side of town[/tab]

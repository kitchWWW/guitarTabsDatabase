	Neon lights draw me like a moth to a flame[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]B[/ch]			    [ch]F#[/ch]
	momma raised me right, that just leaves me to blame[/tab]
[tab]	       [ch]B[/ch]                          [ch]E7[/ch]

	I'm old enough to know better, but I'm still too young to care[/tab]

Verse2: Cowgirls with an attitude, boots and tight bluejeans
	take my mind off doin' right, and doin' other things
	when the weekend's gone, I won't have a dime to spare

[tab]	                                          [ch]F#[/ch]
	the boss-man yelling something at me that I don't understand[/tab]
[tab]	  [ch]B[/ch]                                 [ch]E7[/ch]
	I don't know how I got to work, but I sure know I'm there[/tab]

Verse3: When the eagle flies on Friday, well he barely leaves the ground
	I've got just enough left to get dressed up, and head back to town

	I'm old enough to know better, but I'm still too young to care

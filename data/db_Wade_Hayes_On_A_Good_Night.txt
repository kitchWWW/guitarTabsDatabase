On a Good Night
Wade Hayes

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
On a good night I could hop in my truck[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Round up my friends and with any kind of luck[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                             [ch]D[/ch]
We could end up howling at a harvest moon[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
On a good night I could put on my hat[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Head down to the honky tonk and dance[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
But on a real good night I meet a women like you[/tab]


Chorus:
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                                     [ch]G[/ch]
Brown hair blue eyes once in a life time countrified kind of girl[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Heart-breaking chance-taking wild little love making[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Shaking up my world[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Hey on a good night I can picture the day[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
All my dreams come true[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
But on a real good night I meet a women like you[/tab]


On a good night I can drive to the lake
Turn on the radio and find George Strait
Then go play a little game of eight ball pool
On a good night I might be found
Draggin  with the boys cross town
But on a real good night I meet a women like you

Chorus
Bridge

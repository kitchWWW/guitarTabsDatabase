[Verse]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Yes, I'll take you back again, you knew I would[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
For I go on lovin' you that's understood[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                             [ch]D[/ch]
But it's the first time you've come back with tears in your eyes[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
Lately someone's taught you how to cry[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Someone had to teach you I didn't have the heart to[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]E[/ch]
Hurt you just like you've been hurting me[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Someone had to teach you things it's time that you knew[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
Now maybe you'll be satisfied with me[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
Someone took your heart and rubbed it in the dirt[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                       [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]
And you look just like a baby when it's hurt[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
But you had this lesson coming for so very long[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
Our sins all have a way of coming home[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Someone had to teach you I didn't have the heart to[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]E[/ch]
Hurt you just like you've been hurting me[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Someone had to teach you things it's time that you knew[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
Now maybe you'll be satisfied with me[/tab]

Verse 1
[tab]	[ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
	I drove around last night, and tried with all my might[/tab]
[tab]	             [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
	To leave the past behind, cause you stayed on my mind[/tab]
[tab]	   [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
	So I stopped for a drink, I never stopped to think[/tab]
[tab]	        [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
	That it wouldn't work, It just made it worse[/tab]
[tab]	   [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
	So I came on back home, I hadn't changed a thing[/tab]
[tab]	    [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
	And sat here all alone, missing you and wondering[/tab]

Chorus
[tab]	[ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
	Where do I go to start all over[/tab]
[tab]	            [ch]D[/ch]
	When theres no place to hide[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
	From your memory[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
	Where do I go to start all over[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
	When in your arms is where I won't be[/tab]

Verse 2
[tab]	[ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
	I'd take some things and leave, If the change of scenery[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
	Would do me any good, Like I know it should[/tab]
[tab]	[ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
	I'd still be missing you, What goods a different view[/tab]
[tab]	     [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
	To a broken heart, We'd still be apart[/tab]
[tab]	    [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
	Someday I'll find the answer, To this mystery[/tab]
[tab]	      [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
	But tonight the same old question, Just keeps on haunting me[/tab]

Chorus.........

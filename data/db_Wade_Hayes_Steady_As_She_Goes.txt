Steady As She Goes - Wade Hayes
-------------------------------

This song is on the "Old enough to know better" CD and was written by Don Cook
along with Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn of Brooks & Dunn. I guess you could kinda
tell 'cause the chord sequence in the verses is identical to that of Brooks &
Dunn's "Workin' on my next broken heart"...

Tonight I came home late again, she didn't ask me where I've been[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                       [ch]D[/ch]
Her bags were packed and sitting by the door[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
She looked at me and said goodbye, I did my best to change her mind[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
But she don't wanna hear it anymore[/tab]

        If I said it didn't hurt, oh I'd be lying[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
        Where she got the strength to leave Heaven only knows[/tab]

[tab]                   (N.[ch]C[/ch].) [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
        But she's a rock,    steady as she goes[/tab]

It tears me up to watch her go, but deep inside my heart I know[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Leaving is the only choice she has[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
I guess she finally got the nerve to give me just what I deserve[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
She's had enough and she ain't lookin' back[/tab]

[INTRO] 
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

[VERSE 1]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
We were half a mile high on the ferris wheel[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
At our old county fair[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
I didn't even know we had trouble until[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
She told me way up there[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
That's when my life started spinnin' 'round[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
My world came crashin' to the ground[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
The day that she left Tulsa[/tab]


[CHORUS]
[tab]     [ch]C9[/ch]
In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
With the caution lights flashing in the passing lane[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C9[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
From a bridge I watched our dreams going down the drain[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]C9[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain[/tab]


[VERSE 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
No she wasn't showing yet but she'd be by Christmas time[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Up there like a fool I took for granted it was mine[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
She never came out and told me that I was wrong[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
But all of a sudden the light came on[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
The day that she left Tulsa[/tab]


[CHORUS]
[tab]     [ch]C9[/ch]
In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
With the caution lights flashing in the passing lane[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C9[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
From a bridge I watched our dreams going down the drain[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]C9[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]

[BRIDGE]

[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                                       [ch]Em[/ch]
I guess she thought the truth would end up driving me away[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]C/B[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
Well she was wrong but I never had the chance to say[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Dsus2[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]

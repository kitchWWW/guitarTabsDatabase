[tab][ch]G[/ch]
When I pull in the drive where your car used to be[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
It doesn't hurt me like it used to[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
I can walk through the door and not wonder anymore[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
Where you are like I used to[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
I can go down the hall see the pictures on the wall[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
And not miss you but I just can't bring myself to go into...[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
The room where I spent every night with you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
And the light of the moon came through the window[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And I held you we were so close[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
And it's just too soon for me to go into the room[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I'd remember too much if I opened that door[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And I'm not sure if I could face it[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
The bed's emptiness would remind me you're with[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
Someone else and I couldn't take it[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
So I sleep on the couch in our living room now[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]D[/ch]
Since our love died 'cause I'm still not ready yet to go inside...[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
The room where I spent every night with you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
And the light of the moon came through the window[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And I held you we were so close[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
And it's just too soon for me to go into the room[/tab]

[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
Where the light of the moon came through the window[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And I held you we were so close[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Bm[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
And it's just too soon for me to go into the room [/tab]

UP NORTH, DOWN SOUTH, BACK EAST, OUT WEST
Wade Hayes

[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
In spite of the name,[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]E[/ch]
Independance, Kansas - didn't grow any wild roses[/tab]
But she was young and restless, and I loved her
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
Though holding her down was hopeless[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I wanted her to say, she couldn't live without[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
The life I had to offer, but all she could talk about[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
Was far away dreams[/tab]
Cities she'd never seen
How do I find that girl, when she could be

[tab][ch]A[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Out there - any where[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
She just up and left[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]F#m[/ch]
She didn't leave a forward ing ad dress[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
Or a trail for my lonely heart to follow[/tab]
Which one of those
[tab][ch]A[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]
Four winds should I go chasin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]         [ch]F#m[/ch]
She could be in a million places, I guess[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Up north, down south, back east, out west[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]
She could be up in the Windy City[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]
Where the world spins a little faster[/tab]
Or gettin' a tan, down in Miami
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
That might be where I catch her[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe back in Virginia, her cousin lives there[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Out in Arizona, she'd fit in anywere[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]
It's anyone's guess where she came to rest[/tab]
But, my one chance for happiness is

[tab][ch]A[/ch]   [ch]E[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Out there - any where[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
She just up and left[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]F#m[/ch]
She didn't leave a forward ing ad dress[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
Or a trail for my lonely heart to follow[/tab]

[tab][ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
I'm sittin' here in a four-way inter section[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
Praying Lord, won't you point me in the right dir ection[/tab]

She could be (A-one strum) out (E-one strum) there - any(D-one strum)where
[tab]         [ch]E[/ch]
She just up and left[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]F#m[/ch]

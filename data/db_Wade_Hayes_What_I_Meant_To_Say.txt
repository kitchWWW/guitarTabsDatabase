Last night I told a lie[/tab]
When I told you I could say goodbye
Here in the light of day
What a crazy thing for me to say?

CHORUS
What I meant to say was
I love you
What?s been killing me is
I hurt you
What I didn?t do was hold you
When I saw the teardrops fall
What I should have said was
I?m sorry
What I should have said was
Forgive me
What I meant to say was
What I didn?t say at all

Last night I had a dream
You were really walking out on me
I woke up scared to death
Please forget about the things I said?

CHORUS

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
One day in summer when daylight was fading[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
Way down by the river, I wandered alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
I met an old man who was weepin' and wailin'[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
And rocking a cradle that was not his own[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Singing, "Aidal O'boy, sweet baby lie easy[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]E7[/ch]
Your own daddy will never be known[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Oh it's weeping and wailing and rocking a cradle[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
For somebody's baby that is not your own"[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D[/ch]
When first I married your innocent mother[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
I thought like a fool I was blessed with a wife[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
But to my misfortune and sad lamentation[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
She proved both a curse and a plague to my life[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Singing, "Aidal O'boy, sweet baby lie easy[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]E7[/ch]
Your own daddy will never be known[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Oh it's weeping and wailing and rocking a cradle[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
For somebody's baby that is not your own"[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
'Twas every night to a ball or a party[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
She left me there rocking the cradle alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
An innocent baby who calls me his daddy[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
And little he knows that I am not his own[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Singing, "Aidal O'boy, sweet baby lie easy[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]E7[/ch]
Your own daddy will never be known[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Oh it's weeping and wailing and rocking a cradle[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
For somebody's baby that is not your own"[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Now all you young fellows who someday may marry[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
Take my advice and leave women alone[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
For by the Lord Harry, if ever you marry[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
They'll bring you a baby and swear it's your own[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Singing, "Aidal O'boy, sweet baby lie easy[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]E7[/ch]
Your own daddy will never be known[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Oh it's weeping and wailing and rocking a cradle[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
For somebody's baby that is not your own"[/tab]

WADE JOHNSTON - Time
*******

As far as I know, this is the first tab of any of Wade's music on ultimate guitar. 
I discovered this song years ago but this was back when I just started playing. 
I couldn't figure out the chords by ear and gave up on playing this beautiful song. 
Now, five years later, here it finally is.
It's not perfect because Wade is just too pro, but I'd say the rough chords are correct. 
Just play around with the notes and see what happens. Have fun! :)

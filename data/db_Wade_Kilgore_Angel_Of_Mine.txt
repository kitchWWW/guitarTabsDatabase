[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                     [ch]G[/ch]
High school was out, in that little Texas town, on a Summery day[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                             [ch]G[/ch]
When I found an old worn out photograph that changed everything[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                                      [ch]G[/ch]
A little blue eyed girl with blonde hair just like mine sitting on my daddy's knee[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]F#/D[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
Written on the back was August '79 Whitwell, Tennessee[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                             [ch]G[/ch]
Well that's where I was born, when mom and dad divorced, mom headed West[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch]
To big wide open spaces, looking for room to forget I guess[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                       [ch]G[/ch]
But I don't know how we made without you in our life[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
Cause every day that goes by, every day that goes by[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
You're on my mind, all the time[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
When the world's got me down on my knees[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Or when it's all going right, and I want to share some smiles[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
You're the first one that I'm gonna ring[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I know you'll always be there by my side[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
Through anything, anywhere, anytime[/tab]
N.C.
Angel of mine


[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                     [ch]G[/ch]
It was all a little strange, driving out that day, to meet you for the first time[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                     [ch]G[/ch]
But an overdue hug and a smile from above said everything was gonna be alright[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                                              [ch]G[/ch]
And we talked about yesterdays and growing up so far away, and how life ain't always fair[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
And as the pain fades away, well it all fades away[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
You're on my mind, all the time[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
When the world's got me down on my knees[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Or when it's all going right, and I want to share some smiles[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
You're the first one that I'm gonna ring[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I know you'll always be there by my side[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
Through anything, anywhere, anytime[/tab]
N.C.
Angel of mine


[Bridge]
[tab] [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
The puzzles in life may change[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
But one piece will always be the same[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]
You're on my mind, all the time[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
When the world's got me down on my knees[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Or when it's all going right, and I want to share some smiles[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
You're the first one that I'm gonna ring[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
I know you'll always be there by my side[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]
Through anything, anywhere, anytime[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Yeah anything, anywhere, anytime[/tab]
N.C.
Angel of mine

[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
There's a little boy in the sandlot down the road[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                             [ch]D[/ch]
Calling his own play by play with every swing and every throw[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
He's spittin' sunflower seeds on the ground[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
Yellin' strike three batter your out[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
He's just living the dream and that's a beautiful thing[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Take me out to the ball game[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
With a rowdy Rangers crowd[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
A party under the big lights for a major league show down[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]
There's no place I'd rather be[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
Than rootin' for my home team[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
But if we don't win that's alright[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
We'll be back again tomorrow night[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
For another ball game[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
The grass is mowed and the infield's watered down[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                                  [ch]D[/ch]
The warmups are over and the defense is charging out[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
The stands begin to rock[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]
As the batter takes the box[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
The game is on so come on and let's do this thang[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]

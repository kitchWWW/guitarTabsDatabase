Daddy's Day
CAPO 2

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                                             [ch]G[/ch]
She put on her favorite yellow dress, her hair in a pony tail tied with a pretty blue bow[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
It was Daddy's Day at school, she said "I'm ready to go"[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                                                   [ch]G[/ch]
Her mamma said "baby you don't have to go, the kids might not understand why you're up there alone"[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
She said "It'll be OK, mommy I'm not afraid"[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                         [ch]C[/ch]                                           [ch]G[/ch]
She stood tall at the front of the class, and heard someone whisper "probably just another deadbeat dad"[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
But she just smiled and the teacher said "darling, go ahead"[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
My daddy couldn't be here today[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Cause heaven's just too far away[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
But I know he's watching over me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Cause right before he had to go[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
He said "baby you'll never be alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
You see the Good Lord gave me wings"[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
So I know he can hear me say[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]
Happy Daddy's Day[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                                             [ch]G[/ch]
We've got a flag on the fireplace, sitting next to a picture of my daddy in his plane[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
I know he loved to fly more than anything[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                                                             [ch]G[/ch]
He joined the Air Force when he was kid, wanted adventures and stories to tell his grandkids[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
And someday I'll tell them the stories that he told me[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Daddy couldn't be here today[/tab]

Cause heaven's just too far away[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]
Cause right before he had to go[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
He said "baby you'll never be alone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
You see the Good Lord gave me wings"[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
So I know he can hear me say[/tab]

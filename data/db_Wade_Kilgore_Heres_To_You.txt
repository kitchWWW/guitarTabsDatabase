[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
It was good to see you out last night[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
How you been, it's been a while[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I was flipping through the old yearbook[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]
A lot of things changed, but not your looks, you still look good[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
So here's to you and here's to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
It's not the way we thought it'd be[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You've got your life and I've got mine[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
We always said that would be fine[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
But being friends ain't working out[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
It's too much pain to live without[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]  N.C.
So here's to you and here's to me[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Your little girl looks a lot like you[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Happy and sweet just like you were too[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
It takes me back to our history[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch] [ch]B[/ch]
And the way we thought that it would be[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
So here's to you and here's to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
It's not the way we thought it'd be[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You've got your life and I've got mine[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
We always said that would be fine[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
But being friends ain't working out[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
It's too much pain to live without[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]  N.C.
So here's to you and here's to me[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]
I was thinking now that we're both free[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]
Would you take another chance on me[/tab]

[Solo]
[ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
So here's to you and here's to me[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
It's not the way we thought it'd be[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
You've got your life and I've got mine[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
We always said that would be fine[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
But being friends just didn't work out[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
It's too much love to live without[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
To live without[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]  N.C.
So here's to you and here's to me[/tab]

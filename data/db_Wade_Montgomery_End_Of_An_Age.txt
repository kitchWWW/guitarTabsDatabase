[Intro]
[ch]Am[/ch] [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]
I grew up with stories 'bout the ghost of boot hill[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Teddy Blue Abbott and Scandalous Bill[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
Them boys are all gone now, them holes have been filled[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
By bodies of cowboys who left no wills[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]
  And some are sadder than hell[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
You only hear them stories when you're out on the range[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
With real old boys on the real old plains[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
Not rodeo riders or farmers of land[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Not a singer in a barroom, or an Ag. Businessman[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]
  Just sad old campfire tales[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
And I heard this story back when I was a kid[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
About a crafty wild stallion and he stole mares and hid[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]F[/ch]
  They couldn't kill him 'cause he stayed out of range[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
He was a saber toothed rocket with a human brain[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]
  The king of the plains[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
And Old Tex watched him for many a year[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
And he followed his hoof steps and learned what he feared[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
He staked out four geldings, the fastest he had[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
In twenty mile stretches, 'cross a hundred mile of land[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]
  Gumbo and Hardpan[/tab]

[Verse 5]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]
And early next mornin' he spotted his prey[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
And he built to the stallion on his horse named Bay[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
And they jumped two fences as they tore 'cross the plains[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
Hazin' that stallion t'wards the next horse exchange[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]
  And gave Bay the reins[/tab]

[Verse 6]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]
And he got off Bay all lathered and sore[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
And he saddled up Red and went a'runnin' some more[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
Chasing that stallion 'cross badlands and sage[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
With the stallion and Tex all caught in a rage[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]
  Of this horse that won't cage[/tab]

[Verse 7]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                           [ch]F[/ch]
The next horse was Buck, when it came down to swap[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
The hot afternoon sun had old Red 'bout to drop[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]
Buck was sure-footed and quick on his feet[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
And they went chasin' the stallion in the Montana heat[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]
  The stud ain't missin' a beat[/tab]

[Verse 8]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]
The last horse was Blackie with the sun gettin' low[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
And that old western horizon beginnin' to glow[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]F[/ch]
The stallion he stumbled and fell with his pride[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
But got up a'runnin' and damn how he tried[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]
  And then he fell and died[/tab]

[Verse 9]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
I've talked about horses but I ain't mentioned Tex[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
With blood on his chaps, from them blisters that bled[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
A hundred miles runnin' had taken its toll[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
That old stud was his hero, his heart and his soul[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]
  'Til now he didn't know[/tab]

[Verse 10]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
Tex looked on the ground where he died[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
And a defiant look was still a glare in his eye[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]F[/ch]
The stallion had stumbled and died in the sage[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
It all represented the end of an age[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]
  The end of an age[/tab]

[Verse 11]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]
I grew up with stories 'bout the ghost of boot hill[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Teddy Blue Abbot and Scandalous Bill[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
Them boys are all gone now, them holes have been filled[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
By bodies of cowboys who left no wills[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]
  And some are sadder than hell[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]                         [ch]Am[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]
And some are sadder than hell[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Am[/ch]
And some are sadder than hell[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
Well there ain't no honky tonks left in Shreveport[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]D[/ch]
And they don't play country music on the 80s strip(?)[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
But it still smells like snow in Bossier City[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
So you can kiss my ass I ain't never gonna quit[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
Well I've played my share of strip mall bars for nothin'[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]D[/ch]
And casinos so I could just pay the bills[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
I've been toe-to-toe with cover bands and DJs[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
And people who dont wanna let me in[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
But there's still a few of us that drink smoke and cuss[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
And know good country music when it's played[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
So I'll keep on keepin' on singin' all my songs[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
Kickin' ass raisin' hell and takin' names[/tab]


[Interlude]

[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Well don't even get me started on the Hayride[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Hank's probably rollin' over in his grave[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
It's a bunch of imitatin' washed up never has beens[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
Runnin' 'round and whorin' out the name[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
These days everybody thinks that they're an outlaw[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
With their Willie shirt bought straight from the mall[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]                   [ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]G[/ch]
And they think the Dukes of Hazard's the only good Waylon song[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
And know good country music when it's played[/tab]

So I'll keep on keepin' on singin' all my songs[/tab]

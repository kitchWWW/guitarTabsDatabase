Artist: Wade Reeves
Song: Trashy Turns Me On
Genre: 
Key: 


I don't own any rights to this song. I heard it on YouTube while looking for other Wade Reeves 
material since he only has one album on iTunes as of today (12/13/2015). Thought this was a very funny
song and would be fun to play with friends and around campfires. The chords used in the song are in 
the songs key and they also work for my voice. Hope you enjoy!

[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
Behind a brand new, Doublewide[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
I had it cranked up loud[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
And had a rowdy crowd [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Just watching' em dance and fight[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
And ran her fingers through her bleach blonde hair[/tab]


{Chorus}
[tab]                           [ch]C[/ch]
She took me back to the trailer park[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]
Makin’ love in the pitch black dark[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
Man, we rocked the trailer of them cinder blocks[/tab]

She was Turning me on[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]
A little Suburb outside of Dallas[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]G[/ch]
A brand new 80 foot, single wide palace [/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
A pack of rubbers and a box of Cialis [/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
We rocked it all night long [/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]C[/ch]
Cause I was hog tied in that single wide[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]G[/ch]
Tat on her back, and her hair was dyed[/tab]
                             D (2 beats then pause)
Man, she’s painted up, but thats what I like

Cause trashy turns me on[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
{Verse 2}[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
She had legs for days, and a body that amaze[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Its like the seven wonders, of the world[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And a cheap tan, and fake nails on her hands[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
Just a crazy, sexy, trashy, country girl [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
When I got done, she said son[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Your comin' back, home with me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]
Well hell I followed her back in my pickup truck[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
The rest is just history[/tab]

Here we go!

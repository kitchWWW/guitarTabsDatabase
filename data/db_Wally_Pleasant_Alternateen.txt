[Intro]
[ch]A[/ch]  [ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]F#m[/ch]
Alternateen, you are so beautiful to me[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                                                    [ch]E[/ch]
With your Nine Inch Nails bumper sticker on your black leather jacket[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
Alternateen, please take my hand,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]E[/ch]
And we can walk together into the mosh pit of life[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]F#m[/ch]
Alternateen, would you go to Lollapalooza with me,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
And we can pay 5 dollars for a glass of water[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]F#m[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
Alternateen, when I read your poetry, I can feel your pain,[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]E[/ch]
'Cause no one understands you but me[/tab]

[Bridge 1]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
I was walking down Haight Street[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
In San Francisco[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
When a counter-cultured youth cornered me[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
She had a freshly died purple mohawk[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
Hundred and twenty dollar Doc Martin boots[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
So in other words, she was wearing about as much equity as[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]
I had made so far this year[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
And with a wanting look[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
On her pale face[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
She asked me for some change[/tab]
        N.C.
I said, "Change comes from within"

[Verse 3]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]F#m[/ch]
Alternateen, I love you[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
From your cute little pierced nose, to your tattoo[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]F#m[/ch]
Alternateen, let's go to the mall by where you live,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                           [ch]E[/ch]
And we can hang out with all the other mallternative kids[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]F#m[/ch]
Alternateen, and then we can take a risk,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                                [ch]E[/ch]
And buy a compact disc, by a band that no one's ever heard of[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
Alternateen, please take my hand,[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                                                 [ch]E[/ch]
And we can walk through this meaningless, superficial world together[/tab]

[Solo]
[ch]A[/ch]  [ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]
[ch]A[/ch]  [ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]

[Bridge 2]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
The day Kurt Cobain died,[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#m[/ch]
We both held each other and cried[/tab]
D                                  D/D#/E
But you made me feel a lot better,
                N.C.
When you said, "Thank God it wasn't Eddie Vedder"

[Verse 5]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]F#m[/ch]
Alternateen, you're such a tortured soul[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                                        [ch]E[/ch]
'Cause you broke up with me, when I said I like mid-70's rock'n'roll[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]F#m[/ch]
Alternateen, you really broke my heart,[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                                                              [ch]E[/ch]
And now the only time that I can see you is when you're working at K-Mart[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
But I'll always love you, alterna-----teen[/tab]

[Intro]

[Verse]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
I'm drunk in the South just like Hank[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]D7[/ch]
I'm weighed down in the mouth just like Hank[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
You can hide your eyes through a thin surprise[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
But I can see through what you think[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Because I've got spirits tonight just like Hank[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
And I'm wild in the gut just like Hank[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]D7[/ch]     
I've been bruised up and cut just like Hank[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]
I've got snakes in my dreams but I don't know what that means[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]                 
But it's all just more reason to drink[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Lord I've got spirits tonight just like Hank[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Well they stripped him of place and time[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]
Yeah they stripped him of body and mind[/tab]

 
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
I've got Hell staring at me just like Hank[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
I'm still a long gone daddy just like old Hank[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
I've got a girl on each arm and a real mojo charm[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
And it should be enough but it ain't[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
I've got a big hole right through me just like Hank[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]

And so I'll sing these sad tunes and howl at the moon[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
And I'll play this old box till I just can't[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
Cause I ain't fooling around just like Hank[/tab]

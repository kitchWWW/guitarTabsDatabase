[Intro]
NONE


[Verse]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
 There were years, I was down[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Am[/ch]
Quarter-life crisis at my door[/tab]

On the floor, on the town
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]
Crying till I couldn't anymore[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Till I couldn't anymore[/tab]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
 Jaded days, faded nights[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
Memories I'd rather not recall[/tab]

All the anxious, broken time
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]
Wouldn't wanna relive it at all[/tab]

[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
Wouldn't wanna relive it at all[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]
(But I would if I had too)[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]
For all that I went through[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
It led me home to you[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
You made beginnings out of all of my ends[/tab]

[tab] [ch]C[/ch]
For every broken path[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I wouldn't take it back[/tab]

[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
I'll never think about what else could have been[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
It gave me you, so I would do it all ovеr again[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
It gave me you, so I would do it all over again[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]
Parallеl, you and I[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]
Running like rivers to the sea[/tab]

Where we fell, how we rise
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
Looking back now, it's how it had to be[/tab]

[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
It's how it had to be-ee[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]
For all that I went through[/tab]

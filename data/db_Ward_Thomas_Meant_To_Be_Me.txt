[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
[ch]D/F#[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]Bm[/ch]
I still sit around thinking[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]D/F#[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Wondering what you've been up   to[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]
And if you're happy now[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
Sure looks like she loves you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
And the 'what could've been's'[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D/F#[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
Are always what I come back to[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Like it's always been you[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]Bm[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
'Cause I missed out, could've worked out[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
But I had my doubts, they all seem stupid now[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
It's so bittersweet[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
I could've had it all[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
It was everything I need[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
But I thought I wanted more[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D/F#[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Now she's lying in your arms[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
It fits so perfectly[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And it still breaks my heart[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Was it meant, was it meant to be me?[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
I realise, it doesn't do me any good[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]D/F#[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]
To dream about the good times[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
And a part of me knows it was the right thing to say goodbye[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]
But I lie awake at night[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]
I toss and turn and wonder why[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Bm[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
In hindsight[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
It's so bittersweet[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
I could've had it all[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]

It fits so perfectly[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
And it still breaks my heart[/tab]

Was it meant, was it meant to be me?[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
Was it meant to be me?[/tab]

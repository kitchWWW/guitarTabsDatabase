[Verse]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                            
My ambitions have gone out the window[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m[/ch]                                        [ch]D[/ch]
They are sinking in the depths of the ocean with no warning[/tab]

My frail solemn bones are aching
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
From this tired words to redeem my self[/tab]

What was I thinking[/tab]
[tab]                                       [ch]F#m[/ch]
I wasn't that's the point that you are missing[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]D[/ch]
Lost causes in the voids while I was drinking[/tab]

You said it's unhealthy
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
But the truth be told I was only bored[/tab]

Oh tragedy, you've come to confide in me once more[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
But I was passed out on the floor[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]Bm[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Oh irony, I feel like you've been here before[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#m[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
But the lights were off and there was no one home[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]A[/ch]
To greet you at the door[/tab]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                 [ch]F#m[/ch]
Reclamation, a reckless report of renovations[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]D[/ch]
A sequence of chores and innovations[/tab]

It sounds like a bore
[tab]          [ch]Bm[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Could you turn the tube back to channel 4[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]                                                    [ch]F#m[/ch]
My television has more reaction the looks that you have given[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
On trial with crooks, there's no division[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]Bm[/ch]
I'm one in the same, but you're always wrong[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
I'll never point the blame[/tab]

[tab]               [ch]F#m[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]

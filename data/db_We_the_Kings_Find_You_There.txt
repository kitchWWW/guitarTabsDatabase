Verse: (same)

So tell me why
Why you want a world between us
Let me try
I know you know this time I mean it
Say you still care and you need me

So where'd you go
Something in your voice that says you're not alone
Do you remember when I said I'll always be there
Believe me


Chorus: (same)

Even when the sky falls and I've lost it all
I know I will find you there
Even when my heart stops I'll keep looking
Cause I know i'll Find you there
You know I will Find you
I'll Find you
I'll Find you there
You know i'll Find you
I'll Find you
I'll Find you there

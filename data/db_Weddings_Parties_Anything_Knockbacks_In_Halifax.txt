[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
It's Saturday night in Halifax[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
The kids are out there dancing[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
It's the same old beat, it's all over the world[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
And in her eyes[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
I could've sworn I saw the Northern Lights[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
But it was a light flashing from the disco's silver ball[/tab]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
I come ten thousand miles to be here[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
I can't say that I'm not glad[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
I won't say that it's the best old time that I have ever had[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
And sure I'd like to dance, my girl[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
But hey, not to that song[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
For I hated it in Sydney, I despised it in Geelong[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
And it's Saturday night in Halifax[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
The kids are out there dancing[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
It's the same old beat, it's all over the world[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
And in her eyes[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
I could've sworn I saw the Northern Lights[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
But it was a light flashing from the disco's silver ball[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]
You saw me queuing for admission[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Saw me looking at my watch[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
Saw me freezing in my jacket, fearful of the cold I'd catch[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
And I love the Bluenose girlies[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
I love the Bluenose beer[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
But when I dance to Whitney Houston[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
I wonder what I'm doing here[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
And it's Saturday night in Halifax[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
The kids are out there dancing[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
It's the same old beat, it's all over the world[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
And in her eyes[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
I could've sworn I saw the Northern Lights[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
But it was a light flashing from the disco's silver ball[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
Now do you like the clothes I'm wearing?[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Or perhaps I should have changed?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Can you understand my talking?[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Do you think that I talk strange?[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
But if you can't understand me, darlin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
That's not such a shame[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
For the shit we talk at discos the world over sounds the same[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
And it's Saturday night in Halifax[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
The kids are out there dancing[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
It's the same old beat, it's all over the world[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
And in her eyes[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
I could've sworn I saw the Northern Lights[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
But it was a light flashing from the disco's silver ball[/tab]

[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
It seems now the night is over[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
It seems I've lost my mystique[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
She got the bloke from Montreal[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
I got a kiss upon the cheek[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
With a belly full of bitter[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
It's a walk home in the rain[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
There might be one more drunk in Halifax[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
But some things never change[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]         N.C.     [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
And it's Saturday night in Halifax[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
The kids are out there dancing[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
It's a rocking beat, it's all over the world[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
And in her eyes[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
I could've sworn I saw the Northern Lights[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
But it was a light flashing from the disco's silver ball[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
That dirty old silver ball[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
It gets me every time[/tab]

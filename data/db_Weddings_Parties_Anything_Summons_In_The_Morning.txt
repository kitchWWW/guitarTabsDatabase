Summons in the Morning – Weddings, Parties, Anything


[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]Bm[/ch]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
I looked down the street it was bitter quiet,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]F#[/ch]
A gentle rain was falling all around,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
I looked at the brick wall, it was destitute,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
An uglier piece of architecture you have never found.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]
So I produced a poster from my overcoat,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]F#[/ch]
A paintbrush, a bucket full of glue,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
I stuck a poster on the barren wall,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                         [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
It looked so fine but then a voice said, "We've got news for you..."[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
"Son, it's too late and I don't want a debate,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
There is no way you can get off with a warning.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Son, don't be dense! You know it's an offence[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
And you must expect a summons in the mor--ning."[/tab]
[ch]Bm[/ch]


[Verse]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
I said, "Are you mad? Perhaps you're just unwell.[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]F#[/ch]
Could it be your quota's looking meagre?"[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                            [ch]A[/ch]
He said, "Just you watch your tongue or we'll have you in the cell."[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
The junior constable she looked so eager,[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
I said, "Why don't you go find some axe murderer?[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]F#[/ch]
Someone you can chase and apprehend[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Anyone can see that we are meaning little harm,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
Anyone can see that what we do does not offend."[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
"Son, it's too late and I don't want a debate,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
There is no way you can get off with a warning.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Son, don't be dense! You know it's an offence[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
And you must expect a summons in the mor--ning."[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
So I just stay home and watch my telly now,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]F#[/ch]
My postering, I have given it away.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
Pneumonia costs nothing, but I can't pay the fines,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]Em[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
My bank balance been frittered all a-way.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                      [ch]A[/ch]
And to the visuals of the city I'll not contribute,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]F#[/ch]
Though I am poorer now but still no wiser.[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                                     [ch]A[/ch]
And if the boys in blue they had their way with Collingwood,[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
We might as well be living in Geelong or Mt. Eliza![/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
"Son, it's too late and I don't want a debate,[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
There is no way you can get off with a warning.[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
Son, don't be dense! You know it's an offence[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
And you must expect a summons in the mor--ning."[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]Bm[/ch]
And you must expect a summons in the mor--ohh---orrrning![/tab]

10 DAY RUN
As recorded by Whey Jennings
(2024 release)



[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
This tank is almost empty and this is my last load[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I'm counting down the minutes till I get to go back home[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
It's been 10 long days of working[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
While she sits at home all alone[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
I got seven days to love her and these 18 wheels are burning up the road[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
The stars are bright above me and I'm howling at the moon babe[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I hope to be there by tomorrow afternoon[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                                                             [ch]D[/ch]
I know that you hate waiting but this truck is doing all it can do[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]D[/ch]
And with any luck tomorrow I'll be spending supper time with you[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
It's been 10 days on the road I'm trying to get back home[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
My baby's sitting on the couch blowing up my phone[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I know that she ain't happy I'm pretty sure she's lit[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
I don't know how much longer she'll be putting up with this[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
So I better get back home just as fast as I can[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Before she up and leaves me for some wealthy businessman[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I pull up the driveway I'm ready for a fight[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
The lawn is covered in old blue jeans and half smoked Marlboro lights[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I guess she's finally had it she's taken all she can[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
It's just a broken story of a long haul trucking man[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
It's hard to please a woman who could never please her man[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
She's taken me for granted Lord please help me understand[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
It was 10 days on the road I'm trying to get back home[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
She set fire to the couch along with most my clothes[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
I knew that she was crazy but who expected this[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Everything was torn apart soakinâ€™ wet and singed[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
I didn't make it home before it all went up in flames[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
So I put my truck back into gear and I just drove away[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
  Good riddance woman don't ya come back around here no more ya hear[/tab]

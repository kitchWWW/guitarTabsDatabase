[tab]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I can't look at pictures[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]D[/ch]
And I can't say your name[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D7[/ch]
You're no longer here with us[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
And there ain't no one to blame[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
Everyday I cry[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
And at night time too[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause you're gone for good this time[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]D7[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
And there's not a damn thing I can do[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
And I'm mad and I'm sad and I'm bad at being sad[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]
Doing things I don't believe in[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]D7[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
Just to numb the hurt that I have[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                                          [ch]G[/ch]
And I can't figure out if I need a preacher or a pill[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]D7[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]
One to numb the pain but the other one is trained to heal[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
I'm sad because I miss you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
and I'm mad 'cause I don't know what to do[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]D7[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
I'm just bad at being sad and not too damn good at missing you[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
I keep my head spinning with a million and one different thoughts[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                                        [ch]D7[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
To forget the one thought that can completely tears me apart[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
I want to take a trip down memory lane[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
And see things that made us laugh[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
But without you here I can't go there[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D7[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]
So I just avoid the past[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
I'm tired of waiting on time to make it all feel better[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]D7[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
I'll never speak to you again, so I'll just write you this letter[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]                                          [ch]G[/ch]
Pouring out my heart and soul; pen thoughts till my hands quiver[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]D7[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
Just a stagger written word to never be delivered.[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
And I'm mad and I'm sad and I'm bad at being sad[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]
Even though I'd know you were leaving[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D7[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Don't make it easier now[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                                          [ch]G[/ch]
I say lots of threats even god can't help me out[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]D7[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
'Cause he the one that took you to his home above the clouds[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
I'm not mad I know he's loving you[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
But I'm sad 'cause I don't know what to do[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]D7[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
I'm just bad at being sad and not too damn good at missing you[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
Yeah I'm bad at being sad and not too damn good at missing you[/tab]

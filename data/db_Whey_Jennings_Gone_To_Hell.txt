[Verse]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Common sense sure ain't common any more[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
This old world's full of trouble[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
Yes right down to the core[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Some of us are saying[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
That USA has failed[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]A[/ch]
That those stars and stripes[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
don't fly as high in a world[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
gone to hell[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Well I met an old man at the bar[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]
Had his face buried in his hands[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
Said the bank done took my car[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]E[/ch]
Pretty soon they gonna take my land[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]
Well I've worked hard all my life[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]
And I've treated people well[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
But half the price [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
is twice the cost in a world[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
Gone to Hell[/tab]

[Break]
[ch]E[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Rusted chains are an eerie sound[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
In a park where kids can't play[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]A[/ch]
'Cause everybody knows[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
That's where the pedophiles stay[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Well my best friend is doing time[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause he got caught with a little pot[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]A[/ch]
But there's an old boy selling heroin[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]E[/ch]
In the school parking lot[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Well I hit my knees every night[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
To pray God won't you make it right[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
The American dream's become[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]
An old wive's tale[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
You can't drink the water[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]D[/ch]
From your own damn well[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
And everything's for sale[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
It's hard to find a reason[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
In world...[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
Gone to Hell[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
In world...[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
Gone to Hell[/tab]

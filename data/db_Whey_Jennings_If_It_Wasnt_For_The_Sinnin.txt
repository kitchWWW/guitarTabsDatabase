[Intro]

[ch]A[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]

[Verse]

[tab][ch]A[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
I have been ashamed of all my wicked ways[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]A[/ch]
Though I've changed they still remain from my beginings[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
I'm two hundred and sixty days past thirty years of rage[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]B[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]
And it feels good, to finally be livin'[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
But how could I have ever been forgivin'[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
If it wasn't for the sinnin'[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
If it wasn't for the sinnin'[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
I know now I've been committin'[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
I'd never known that I could change my ways[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And no I'm not defending[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
The evil and the wicked[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]E[/ch]
Just pointing out it's not to late to change[/tab]

[Verse]

[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]
When I look at my path, I do anything but laugh[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]
I was on a losers path, I thought was winnin'[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
I was going no where fast, showin' everyone my ass[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]B[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]
And on myself instead of God I was dependin'[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
But how could I have ever been forgivin'[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
If it wasn't for the sinnin'[/tab]

[Instrumental]

[ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
[ch]A[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]
[ch]B[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]

[Chorus]

[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
If it wasn't for the sinnin'[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]
I know now I've been committin'[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
I'd never known that I could change my ways[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And no I'm not defending[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
The evil and the wicked[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]                                [ch]E[/ch]
Just pointing out it's not to late to change[/tab]

[Verse]

[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
They say that dark returns to light[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
I'm hear to say I think they're right[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Cause God is good and so is the life I'm livin'[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]
I love my children and my wife[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
And God surely has blessed our lives[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm7[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
And finally we can stop pretending[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Cause how could we have ever been forgivin'[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
If it wasn't for the sinnin'[/tab]

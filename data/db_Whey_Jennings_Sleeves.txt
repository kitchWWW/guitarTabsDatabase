[Verse]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
He's pulling down his sleeves in mid July[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
He either looks half crazy or full high[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
He's sweating off that fever[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G/B[/ch]     [ch]Am7[/ch]
With a heart as cold as ice[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
He's pulling down his sleeves in mid July[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
She's hiding more than bruises with those sleeves[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
A pain she lets that bag of dope relieve[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Things she can't let go of[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G/B[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
A burden she don't need[/tab]

[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
She's hiding more than bruises with those sleeves[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
And to the ends of hell is where he'll take her[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
Till they wind up 6 feet in the ground[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]Em7[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
Everything stacked up against their favor[/tab]

[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G/B[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
Until the day it all came tumbling down[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
Until the day it all came tumbling down[/tab]


[Vesre]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
She'll follow him no matter where he goes[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
Before they met, she didn't even smoke[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]
Then the way into her heart[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G/B[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]
Became the dollar up her nose[/tab]

[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
She'll follow him no matter where he goes[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
And to the ends of hell is where he'll take her[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                                    [ch]C[/ch]
Till they wind up 6 feet in the ground[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]Em7[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
Everything stacked up against their favor[/tab]

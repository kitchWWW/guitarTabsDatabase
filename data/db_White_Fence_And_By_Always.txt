Play it slow[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
Is it always wrong?         [/tab]

Lay a diamond in a crowd[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]E[/ch]
I see you always[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]A[/ch]
 And by always, I mean carefully[/tab]

A childs square
Another golden tear is down
That weight
The gold thats on your tongue
And i saw you
Love always taken
And by always, I mean carefully

[tab][ch]F[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
 And by always[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
 I'll see it backwards[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
 Like a ledge on a factory[/tab]

A wishing pond
Is what i'm relying on
To skip through
And make it bottom down
And whip you
And always treat you
And by always, I mean carefully

During the solo an A is played over and over with various pitch-changes.

Then play C F D for the rest of the song.

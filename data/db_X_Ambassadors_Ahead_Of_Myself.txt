[tab]                 [ch]Bb[/ch]            [ch]Gm[/ch]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
Some shitty situation that I put you in[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Bb[/ch]       [ch]F[/ch]
And I know we poured champagne[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Bb[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
Maybe we was just too quick to celebrate[/tab]

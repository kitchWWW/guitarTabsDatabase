Artist: X Ambassadors
Song: Falls
Genre: 
Key: B


B5 and E5 guys, that's it. 
When I play it on acoustic, I like to play the power chord 799xxx for B5 and x799xx for the E5. 
That lets me imitate some of the cool slides. 
Of course, the X Ambassadors have an amazing guitar player who's doing tons more than this, 
but this is the basic bones to get the job done. 

[Intro]
[ch]B5[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
Held onto your letters[/tab]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
They’re getting better with age[/tab]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
Now my desk’s like a pulpit[/tab]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
And my bed like a stage[/tab]

[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
See, all these debts keep me under[/tab]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
Ain’t no words worth the cost[/tab]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
If I should carry me farther[/tab]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
Than the load of a lover once lost[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]                                          [ch]E5[/ch]
We used to walk down the road to Buttermilk Falls[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]B5[/ch]
Dip in your feet, put your hair down[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E5[/ch]
Thinking I just won’t make it[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B5[/ch]
And if I go back tomorrow[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]E5[/ch]
Would I still feel the same?[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B5[/ch]
I put my feet in the water but the water got hotter[/tab]

So I just keep my body by the edge of the bay

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
Make believe we were younger[/tab]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
Forget the money we owe[/tab]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
You got your prior commitments, baby[/tab]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
Just wish I had some of my own[/tab]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
‘Cause ain’t no loving me[/tab]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
Before you know what I’m worth[/tab]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
‘Cause you are the life of the party[/tab]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]
And I am the scum of the earth[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]B5[/ch]                                          [ch]E5[/ch]
We used to walk down the road to Buttermilk Falls[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]B5[/ch]
Dip in your feet, put your hair down[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]E5[/ch]
Thinking I just won’t make it[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B5[/ch]
And if I go back tomorrow[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]E5[/ch]
Would I still feel the same?[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B5[/ch]
I put my feet in the water but the water got hotter[/tab]

So I just keep my body by the edge of the bay

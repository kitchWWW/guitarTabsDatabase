[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                                         [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]
    Mexican kids are shooting fireworks below[/tab]

    And  hey baby    it's the 4th of July[/tab]

     We gave up trying so long ago[/tab]

Chorus

Between chorus one and verse two replay the intro chords
John Doe and Tony Gilkyson do a "walk down" bass note run C B G E between the G
and Em chords and a G F# E walk down prior to entering the chorus lines. Listen
to the song to get the feel of the walk down.

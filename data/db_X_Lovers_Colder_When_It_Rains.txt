You’re so pretty and perfect[/tab]

You the queen of the union[/tab]

The city, your servant
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
We follow your footsteps[/tab]

Picked up all your burdens
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
It feel colder when it rains outside[/tab]

So I'm hoping you could be the sun[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I'd do everything to make you mine, yeah[/tab]

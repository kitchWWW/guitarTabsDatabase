There are men lost in jail[/tab]
Crowded fifty to a room
There's too many rats in this cage of the world
[tab]        [ch]Cadd9[/ch]            [ch]G/B[/ch]
And the women know their place[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]
They sit home and write letters[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                                                      [ch]C[/ch]
And when they visit once a year, well, they both just sit there and stare[/tab]

See how we are, gotta keep bars in between us[/tab]
See how we are, we only sing about it once in every twenty years
[tab]                   [ch]C[/ch]   [ch]Csus2[/ch]/[ch]B[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]
See how we are, oh see how we are[/tab]

Now there are seven kinds of Coke
Five hundred kinds of cigarettes
This freedom of choice in the USA drives everybody crazy
But in Acapulco
Well, they don't give a damn
About kids selling Chiclets with no shoes on their feet

See how we are, hey man, what's in it for me?
See how we are, we only sing about it once in every twenty years
See how we are, oh see how we are

Now that highway is coming through
So you all gotta move
This bottom rung ain't no fun at all
'Cause no fires and rock houses
And grape-flavored rat poison
Are the new trinity for this so-called community

See how we are, gotta keep bars on all of our windows
See how we are, we only sing about it once in every twenty years
See how we are, oh see how we are

Well, this morning the alarm rang at noon[/tab]
And I'm trying to write this letter to you
About how much I care and why I just can't be there
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Csus2[/ch]/[ch]B[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
To draw your bath and comb and comb your hair[/tab]

Last night in a nightspot
Where things aren't so hot
My friend said, "I met a boy and I'm in love"
I said, "Oh really, what's this one's name?"
She said, "His first name is Homeboy"
I said, "Could his last name be Trouble?"

See how we are, ah Homeboy, isn't that a Mexican name? (in some versions: I don't trust 
you as far as I could throw you)
See how we are, we only sing about it once in every twenty years
See how we are, oh see how we are
Yeah, see how we are, oh see how we are

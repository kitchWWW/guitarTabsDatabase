Artist: Yabadum
Song: Winter
Genre: 
Key: 


Hey! Just a few notes because I'm kind of a amatuer :) Anything /(note name) is the bass note played with the
chord. Bbm and Bbdim are both a first inversion, and Ab is a second inversion. Also, I'm unsure what chord the
Bbdim9 is. There was no particular name I could find for it, so I used Bbdim9. The chord there is essentially
the Bbdim but C replaces the Bb. If I had the option to write notation for the interludes, I 100% would! But
they are easy to figure out if you're interested, just as long as you know the song. They tend to fit strictly
into the acc. chords and are very repetitive. This is also my VERY first tab, so if anything needs to be
changed or corrected, feel free to let me know! :)

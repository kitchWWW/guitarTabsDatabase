[Intro]
[ch]A[/ch]  [ch]F#m[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
  If I told you that I love you[/tab]
[tab]                                  [ch]F#m[/ch]
Would you tell me that you love me too?[/tab]

Baby would you?
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
  If tomorrow I blew you a kiss[/tab]

Would you say
[tab]                         [ch]F#m[/ch]
Please give me some more of this?[/tab]

Would you?

[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
  Every day when I open my eyes[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]A[/ch]
It is you that I see in my mind[/tab]

It's you
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]
But I know that you'll never love me[/tab]

The way that I love you baby, baby
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]
No matter what I do[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
  And baby you[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]F#m[/ch]
You are the light in my eyes[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
There's nothing that I wouldn't try[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]
And I want to tell you so much[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]A[/ch]
That I just can't hide[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
  And I guess I'm right[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]Am7[/ch]     [ch]F#m[/ch]
'cause you're all that I want in my life[/tab]

You're all that I want
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]
But I know that you'll never love me[/tab]

The way that I love you baby, baby
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]
No matter how hard I try[/tab]

[Instrumental]
[ch]A[/ch]  [ch]F#m[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]F#m[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
  We could both dive into the sea[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]F#m[/ch]
Of a love that lives in the center of me[/tab]

Just to see what we find
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
  I suppose you would not be surprised[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]F#m[/ch]
To find so many pieces of you[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
  If tomorrow I blew you a kiss[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Would you say give me more of this[/tab]

Would you?
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]
But I know that you'll never love me[/tab]

The way that I love you baby, baby
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]
No matter how what I do[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
  And baby I,[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]F#m[/ch]
There's nothing that I wouldn't try[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D[/ch]
Cause you are the light in my eyes[/tab]

'cause you're all that I want in my life[/tab]

You're all that I want
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]
But I know that you'll never love me[/tab]

The way that I love you baby, baby

this is a verson by wastedfishstix. I liked it and wanted to learn it but he never 
a tab, so i took the time and learned it and made a tab for all of you.

the video is here:

It is not perfect but it is how i was able to do it. I like how it adds the bass line to 
song. Also, i thought it was kind of hard to use my index finger for the bass line so i use
my thumb. Use what ever works the best for you. watch the video for more help.

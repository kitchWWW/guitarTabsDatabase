There's an awful idea for those whose[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Ab[/ch]
One desire is to show you[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bbm[/ch]                            [ch]Ab[/ch]

[tab]   [ch]Bbm[/ch]
At night sometimes I wake up[/tab]

The company I'm keeping

The colors on my walls

I don't recognize at all[/tab]

[tab]    [ch]Bbm[/ch]
She said "I've seen your face somewhere[/tab]

Now Fuck me while I'm sleeping

Wasn't that the tops
[tab]             [ch]Ab[/ch]
We're getting off to a good start"[/tab]

I think that I'm in love with you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ebm[/ch]             [ch]Bbm[/ch]
Trust Me, I can tell[/tab]

[tab][ch]Bbm[/ch]
"Lets see how it goes[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Db[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
I like your duvet covers[/tab]
[tab][ch]Ebm[/ch]                [ch]Bbm[/ch]

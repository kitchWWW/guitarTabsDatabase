[Intro]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
We demand some answers, who is responsible?[/tab]
N.C
Someone needs to go

[Verse]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
It was all my fault, I'm the one to blame[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
It was my idea, now I'm filled with shame[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]
As you all well know, I lost control[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
So I'm the one to blame[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]                  [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
When you say it's all your fault, that's not correct[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
After all, I was the architect[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
Well I was the mayor and I voted yes[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
So we share the blame[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]
So it was the three of you? Yes and Kirsty too[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Oh yes definitely me, I screwed up royally[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]
So that's a total of four[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]
Uh, I'm afraid it's two more, the project leader and me[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]A[/ch]
Yes it was all my fault (and mine and mine)[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
And me (me too) and me and him and you[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]
Who is responsible, I need a single name[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
We can't, we're all to blame[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                         [ch]D[/ch]
We were the ones who decided to cover the tower in styrofoam (to blame)[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]
We were the engineers who made sure the process was very slow[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
I was the riot coordinator who totally lost control[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
And we, the people of Hamar didn't support you guys at all[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
But are you sorry? Yes we are![/tab]
[tab]   [ch]A[/ch]
Apologise? Of course we do![/tab]
[tab]         [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
Will you fire anyone? If I could, I would, but who?[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]G[/ch]
We're all just tiny pieces in this catastrophic stew[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                         [ch]D#[/ch]
We're all to blame! We're all to blame![/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]
Yes we are all to blame[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]A[/ch]
You can fire us all[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
There wouldn't be a single person left in city hall[/tab]
N.C.
People of Hamar! Do you want to spend a couple of million, maybe more, who knows, to finish the tower?

[Outro]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
We'll get a giant diving board[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
Who cares what Hamar can afford[/tab]
[tab][ch]D7[/ch]                                        [ch]G[/ch]
We'll get the most expensive tower on the planet[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
It will be oversized and analysed and overpriced but customised for Hamar (diving board)[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
It will be magical, fantastical, affordable for Hamar Town[/tab]

Hi, this is the first time I submit a tab. So sorry in advance if there are any mistakes 
actually a beginner)
Since I've been searching for ages for this tab, I finally tried to do it by myself, 
by some other tabs you can find on UltimateGuitar.com

But still, I didn't managed to find the chords for the end of the song, so if you can 
me and give me any suggestions/corrections, I will gladly edit this tab to complete it. 
& See !

Heaven's not enough
If when you get there…Just another blue
And heaven's not enough
You think you've found it and it loses you

You've thought of all there is
But not enough and it loses you in a cloud

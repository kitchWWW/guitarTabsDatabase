[Verse 1]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Sometimes I've won, sometimes i've lost[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Somtimes I've walked away before the dice were tossed[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
It's not that I chose to be a gamblin' man[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
But you're not left with many options walkin' roads that never end[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
And I'd love to imagine that there's some place for me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
At the end of this long, lonely road[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
I keep tryin' my best, I sure could use a little rest[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
And some help findin' my way home[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
I'm not the best, that's ever been[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
Long ago I vowed I'd find the light I lost back then[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
And you think that you'd be better all alone[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
When there's noone there who loves you and no place to call home[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]
Well I'm growin' tired of this search for my soul, with[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
All of these rocks in the road[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
I keep tryin' my best, sure could use a little rest[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
And some help findin' my way home[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]D[/ch]
A life like mine, must be reasons why[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
So I shouted all the names I knew for God up to the sky[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
And I listen for his answer every day[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
But I grow worried by the waitin', he should know just what to say[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
I'd love to imagine that there's some place for me [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]
At the end of this long lonely road[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
I keep tryin' my best, sure could use a little rest[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
And some help findin' my way home[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
Well I've had friends, they've come and gone[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Bb[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
And I've seen love shine like a sunset &amp; last about as long[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
In the end we're all walkin' different roads[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bb[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
But we're lookin' for the same signs, the ones that lead us home[/tab]


[Verse 4]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
Sometimes I've won, sometimes I've lost[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
Sometimes I've walked away before the dice were tossed[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                            [ch]C[/ch]
It's not that I chose to be a ramblin' man[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
But I see bright lights in the distance and this road it never ends[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
And I'd love to imagine that theres some place for me[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
At the end of this long, lonely road[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
I keep tryin' my best, sure could use a little rest[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch]
And some help findin' my way home[/tab]

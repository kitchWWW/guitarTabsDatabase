[tab]The chord progression for the chorus is [ch]C#[/ch] [ch]G#[/ch] [ch]A#[/ch] [ch]A#[/ch]
Halfway through the second chorus, there is a key change and the chords [/tab]

shift a step up to [ch]D#[/ch] [ch]A#[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]

The bridge chord progression is just picking through the fisrt four 

notes of each chord. The chords are [ch]D#[/ch] [ch]A#[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]A#[/ch]

For the last chorus, the chord progression changes. The first line is [ch]D#[/ch] 

[ch]A#[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] twice, then the it goes into cut time during the second and third 

line. The second line is the normal chorus, just play each chord twice 

as long, and then the last line is [ch]D#[/ch] [ch]A#[/ch] [ch]C[/ch] [ch]G[/ch]

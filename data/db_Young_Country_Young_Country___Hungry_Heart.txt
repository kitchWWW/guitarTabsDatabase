[Intro]
[ch]E[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]                         [ch]A[/ch]
Out on a dark and lonely highway[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                              [ch]E[/ch]
I passed a place called "E. A. T."[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]A[/ch]
I hit the brakes and made a u-turn[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
It's like that sign was calling me[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]A[/ch]
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]E[/ch]
When I walked in and took a seat[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]B[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
An angel came up to my table[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                        [ch]E[/ch]
And said "what's your pleasure" soft and sweet[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
I said I...[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Don't see you on the menu[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
Now that may seem[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]E[/ch]
As though I'm being smart[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
But please allow me to continue[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]
'Cause I wouldn't joke around[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                
Lead you on, put you down[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]
You alone can feed[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
This hungry heart[/tab]

[Instrumental]
[ch]E[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]B[/ch] [ch]E[/ch]

[Verse]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
I said "I bet your name is Linda"[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]E[/ch]
'Cause it was written 'cross her shirt[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
She replied "now ain't you clever"[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]E[/ch]
I sat there feelin like a jerk[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]A[/ch]
And by her calm and cool reaction[/tab]
[tab]                                 [ch]E[/ch]
I thought I'd played my hand and lost[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]B[/ch]
But then she winked and to my napkin[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
And wrote down the time when she got off[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]       [ch]E[/ch]
I said I...[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Don't see you on the menu[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
Now I'll just wait around[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
For you and starve[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
I swear it's love I'm fallin into[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
And I wouldn't joke around[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                
Lead you on, put you down[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
You alone can feed[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
This hungry heart[/tab]

[Outro]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]
'Cause I wouldn't joke around[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                
Lead you on, put you down[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]
You alone can feed[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]E[/ch]
This hungry heart[/tab]

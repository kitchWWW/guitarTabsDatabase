[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]
Wind you neck back in babe,[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C#m[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
You got nothing different to say[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C#m[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
You contradict yourself so much darling[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C#m[/ch]            [ch]B[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]
That I don't listen anyway[/tab]

[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]
Crawl on back to his house[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]  [ch]E[/ch]
I saw you there anyway[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C#m[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
'Cause I've got nothing left for you darling[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C#m[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]
So there’s no reason for you to stay[/tab]


[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                            [ch]E[/ch]               
Now she's regrets 'cause she edged her bets both ways[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                            [ch]B[/ch]

[tab]     [ch]E[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Walk on, if that's all you think of me,[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]C#m[/ch]
If that's all you want it to be[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]B[/ch]
Oh, then you're never going to see[/tab]
So walk on, with me

[tab][ch]C#m[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]
I suppose this is my fault[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C#m[/ch]        [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]
I don't mind taking the blame[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]C#m[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]       [ch]E[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
As long as turn to me and admit [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C#m[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]
that me and you are both the same[/tab]


[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]                                            [ch]E[/ch]

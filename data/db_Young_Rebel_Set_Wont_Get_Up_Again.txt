[ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]

[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
There is a ghost upon my lips [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
of which whose taste I can't resist [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
to call upon each time I miss [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
that touch of grace that I long to feel again. [/tab]

[ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Is there something I don't realize [/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]
a hides behind that bed of lies [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
that calls me back down to my knees; [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
that holds me down and won't let me up again? [/tab]

[ch]D[/ch]
 
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
Cos I've been here 3 times before,[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
to pick my heart up off the floor [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
and I don't think I can take one more [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
and I sure as hell won't go back there again. [/tab]

[ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Even as I try to shake these shackles from my arms[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
everything about this should be ringing bells alarm [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
saying don't go back there, don't get mixed up, [/tab]
don't get knocked down cos you won’t get up again. 

[ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Move yourself into the eyes [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
of all those lovers you despise [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D[/ch]
then you can say with an open heart [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
that you got knocked down but got straight back up again. [/tab]

[ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Even as I try to shake these shackles from my arms[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
everything about this should be ringing bells alarm [/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
saying don't go back there, don't get mixed up, [/tab]
don't get knocked down cos you won’t get up again. 

[ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Carry me not your arms [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]
until those silent bells alarm, [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
of which your eyes can not disguise. [/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]
You will always woe that the next day’s sun will rise. [/tab]

[tab]  [ch]D[/ch]
Impossible is just a word [/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
the most ridiculous I've heard [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]
to leave your lips up to this date,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch] 
let’s give it all up and leave it up to fate. [/tab]

[ch]D[/ch]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Even as I try to shake these shackles from my arms[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
saying don't go back there, don't get mixed up, [/tab]
don't get knocked down cos you won’t get up again.

[tab][ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]  
        You won’t get up again[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]  
        No I won’t get up again[/tab]

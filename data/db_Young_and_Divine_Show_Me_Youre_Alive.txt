VERSE:
F#5                  C#5
Who's the other guy, and what's he got on me?
B/G#               C#5
Take me for a ride with your apologies
F#5                 C#5
Keep me on the side
                   B/G#                  C#5
If you should ever change your mind I'll wait
here patiently

CHORUS:
F#5                   C#5
Show me you're alive, just show me something
    B/G#                C#5
I'm begging you to dive right in with me
   F#5                      C#5
If you don't have the time, I guess I'll make it
B/G#                C#5
Show me you're alive, I'll show you something real

VERSE:
F#5               C#5
Give it to me now, I need some action
   B/G#              C#5
An inner city girl's got my attraction
F#5             C#5
Make up anything and
B/G#                       C#5
I'll believe the words you say without a doubt

MIDDLE8:
D#5                    C#5
You can find me at the bottom of my drink
B/G#                C#5
Singin no I won't go
D#5                    C#5
I'll pick apart every little thing you 
B/G#   C#5
say to me

BRIDGE:
F#5           C#5
You know I go spinning around in circles
B/G#                     C#5
And I know you throw the best mixed signals

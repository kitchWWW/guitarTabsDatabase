Intro :  [ch]C[/ch]

[tab]             [ch]C[/ch]
God this is hard you've had no sleep, you thought of nothing else for weeks[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]G[/ch]
You begin your lines, and fumble with your purse[/tab]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                                  
It's been eating you and you don't know what to do  [/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch] 
And your lie, only made it worse[/tab]

[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
You can't expect him to understand,  he's not a saint, he's just a man[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                                  [ch]G[/ch]
And you know, that you can't change what he did[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]    
But if you had 40 lives,  you d get it right by the 39th,  [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch] 
As it is,  all that you could ask,  all this will pass[/tab]

[tab] [ch]C[/ch]                                                          
God, you wish like hell,  you hadn t done it and you tell  [/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch] 
Him,    how much you regret it[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]C[/ch]                                                      
But you're talking to yourself,  you're as lonely and as desperate [/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch] 
As a kettle boiling, with no there to get it[/tab]

[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]    
All the words you meant to say, hang in the air then float away [/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Am[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]              
And vanish into the end of a dying day[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]    
But if you had 40 lives,  you d get it right by the 39th,  [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch] 
As it is,  all that you could ask,  all this will pass[/tab]

[Don t lie,   ah ah ah]

[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]    
And if only you hadn't stayed, and if only you'd been delayed [/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
And it s funny what a difference a minute makes                          [/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]                    [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]    
But if you had 40 lives,  you d get it right by the 39th  [/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Am[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch] 
As it is,  all that you could ask,  all this will pass[/tab]

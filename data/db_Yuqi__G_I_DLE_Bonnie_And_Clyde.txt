[Verse 1]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
You pick me up when I feel down[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
No matter how deep in the night[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Dm[/ch]
I got your back when we go out[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
You know I'm always on your side[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]
You make this world a little wild[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
And we shout through crowded streets[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Dm[/ch]
Turn up the noise and make it loud[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
And let the world fall at our feet[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]   [ch]Am[/ch]
We love it on the other side[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
Where the dreams are real, do what we like[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
Let them point and laugh at who we are[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]E[/ch]
It was you and me here dancing from the start[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]
We don't need money to feel good[/tab]
[tab]                  [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
'Cause you're the ridе or die, the rest of my lifе[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Dm[/ch]
Don't need a party to feel high[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
We're like the modern version of Bonnie and Clyde[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]
You see the truth, you're in my heart[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]
And you catch me every time[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Dm[/ch]
And if you're low and fall apart[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
I'll bring some peace back in your mind[/tab]

[Intro]
[ch]Am[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  She was an orphan girl[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  Left out on her lonesome in the cruel world[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                    [ch]Dm[/ch]
  She was thumbin' out from Vegas off a Staten curse[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                                     [ch]Am[/ch]
  In this town full of ashes, I knew I found a pearl, found a pearl[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  The heat of summertime[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  We were passionate, restless and we were runnin' wild[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                       [ch]Dm[/ch]
  There was no one could touch us, yeah, her heart was mine[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                                      [ch]Am[/ch]
  She was ready to rev it, and she  was lookin' fine, lookin' fine[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
And she burned something beautiful[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]E7[/ch]
Yeah, the burn now is unstoppab-le[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]E7[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]
 'Cause you can't light a match that's al -  ready on fire[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                       [ch]E7[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
  No, you can't take it back once you've crossed that wire[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]
  She's not goin' down unless she's goin' down in flames[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]E7[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]
  No, you can't light a match that's al-ready on f-i - re[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  The smell of gasoline[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  Her smile reflected the fire in a smell of gasoline[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                             [ch]Dm[/ch]
  She's a smoke show and ragin' like you ain't never seen[/tab]
[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]                                       [ch]Am[/ch]
  She was ready to rev it, and  she was lookin' mean, lookin' mean[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
  Yeah, we burned something beautiful[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]E7[/ch]

[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                                 [ch]Am[/ch]
  She's not goin' down unless she's goin' down in flames[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]E7[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]Am[/ch]
  'Cause you can't light a match that's al-ready on f-i - re[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  Her silhouette's a vision as she's walkin' from the flames[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
  Been a force of raw destruction from an early age[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]
  No one knew what happened the night they found her cryin'[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
  A smoky mess in a tiny orphanage as the flames  were risin' high[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]  [ch]Am[/ch]                                [ch]E7[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]

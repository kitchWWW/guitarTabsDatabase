It was an early morning phone call December 
That got my attention 
They called to tell me that you were gone 
You were the strength of all my hopes and inspirations 
You were the music in my song 

Sometimes what doesn't seem so fair 
That's what makes us more aware 

I know you're smiling 
I know you're singing, I know that you're in a better place 
Where angels wings caress you 
But I still miss you 

More than leaves are falling this October 
It's just that I wanted to stand with you for awhile 
Now I"m walking throught a doorway to tomorrow 
More like running, running out of time 

Sometimes what doesn't seem so fair 
That's what makes us more aware 

I know you're smiling 
I know you're singing, I know that you're in a better place 
Where angels wings caress you 
But I still miss you 

if you play it with the song it mostly sounds right   
enjoy!

I cannot love you, oh I want to[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
And I cannot hold you[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Though these arms, these arms ache for you, yeah[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
And I cannot need you[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
Though this heart, my heart, it tells me I need you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I am sorry, I cannot love you[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]
There was a time when our love, it had a chance[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
But that time is gone, you and I, we can't look back[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]Em[/ch]
You must believe me when I said my heart was yours[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Oh but fate, fate, fate has closed the door[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
But I cannot love you though I want to[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
And I cannot hold you[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Though these arms, these arms ache for you, yeah[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]
And I cannot need you[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]
Though this heart, my heart, it tells me I need you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
I am sorry, I cannot love you[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D[/ch]                          [ch]Em[/ch]
There are days my mind wonders back to you[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]D[/ch]                                      [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Baby, there's nights your memory turns my whole world blue[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]Em[/ch]
Baby, now, we got promises to keep[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
So for right now, I can only love you in my dreams[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
Well, I cannot love you, oh I want to[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]D[/ch]
And I cannot hold you[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Cadd9[/ch]
Though these arms, these arms ache for you, yeah[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
And I cannot need you[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]
Though this heart, my heart, it tells me I need you[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Cadd9[/ch]

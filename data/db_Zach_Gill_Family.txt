[Intro]
[ch]D[/ch]  [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]E[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
She was feeling yuletide-burn[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                   [ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch] [ch]Em7[/ch]
Cause her family was wearing on her nerves[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]      [ch]Em7[/ch] [ch]A7[/ch]                           [ch]Em7[/ch]   [ch]A7[/ch] [ch]Em7[/ch]
She was tired of fighting and feeling frustrated[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]         [ch]Em7[/ch]       [ch]A7[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
Finding it hard to relate to those of whom she was related[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                [ch]Em7[/ch]        [ch]A7[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
You know we all sometimes, say things we don't mean[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em7[/ch]                       [ch]A7[/ch]
But that don't mean that we're not still family[/tab]


[Interlude]
[ch]D[/ch]    [ch]Em7[/ch]  [ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
Generation to generation it gets passed on[/tab]
[tab]                                                           [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]Em7[/ch]
And then one day, those who would passing well they passed on[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch] [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]Em7[/ch]
Pulling back the covers, her heart will start to shudder when she realizes how deep it all went[/tab]
[tab][ch]A7[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]A7[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Trying to forgive what was said, but was never really meant[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                         [ch]Em7[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Well you know we all sometimes, say things we don't mean[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em7[/ch]                  [ch]A7[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
But that don't mean we're not still family[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab]                [ch]Em7[/ch]                        [ch]F#m[/ch]
Pull out of the shadows and find out that eventually[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]F#m[/ch]
It's all bad, it's all good baby can't you see[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em7[/ch]                       [ch]A7[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
That we all, well we all, well we all are still family[/tab]


[Interlude]
[ch]D[/ch]


[Verse 4]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
I was there from the moment that you were born[/tab]
[tab]                                            [ch]Em[/ch]
And I've loved you since I heard your first cries[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]
And I know we won't always be getting along[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em7[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
But I promise you that I will always try[/tab]

You know we all sometimes, say things we don't mean[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em7[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]
But that don't mean that we're not still family[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em7[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]

You know we all sometimes, say things we don't mean[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em7[/ch]                       [ch]A7[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]

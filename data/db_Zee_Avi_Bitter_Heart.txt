You're still somewhere in town,[/tab]

Your dinners getting cold.[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]A[/ch]

(verse 1 chords)

And then you come and tell me the same reason as you did yesterday,
So tell me whats her name?
Doo doo da dum, doo doo da dum, doo doo doo doo doo doo da da dum dum,
da da da da dum, da da da da dum, da da da da dum.


[Chorus]

Bitter heart, bitter heart tries to keep it all inside
Bitter heart, bitter heart shadows will help you try to hide,
Bitter heart, my bitter heart is just getting a little fragile,

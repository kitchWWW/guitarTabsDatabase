[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch]   [ch]F[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]
It was us against the world and the world won[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]
I'd say six years was a good run[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Every single sky, you were the sun[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F[/ch]
But it started to rain while we were[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]Em[/ch]
Planning forever, a house in the desert[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
And I don't even like it there[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
But I could've learned to[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]F[/ch]
If it would have made you stay mine[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                            [ch]F[/ch]
You had me and I had half of what I thought I wanted[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]F[/ch]
Sorry that I couldn't keep the promise[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Even though you're the one who broke me first[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
I found a way to let go of the hurt[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]Em[/ch]
It looks likе you've got enough for the both of us[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
Evеn though, in the end, you got so dark[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]
I don't have a trace of hate in my heart[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]Em[/ch]
It looks like you've got enough for the both of us[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]
For the both of us[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
No, you never thought I'd be the one to move on[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
Before you and I felt like a traitor[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Falling for somebody who only wanted the best for me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
Somebody who never wanted to change me[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus 2]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]F[/ch]
Keep on making me the villain if it makes it better[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]F[/ch]
I should hate you too, but I could never[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
Even though you're the one who broke me first[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]F[/ch]
I found a way to let go of the hurt[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]C[/ch]                                 [ch]Em[/ch]

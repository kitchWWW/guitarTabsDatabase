[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
Morning found me lying on a floor in New Orleans[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                             [ch]E[/ch]
Looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                           [ch]A[/ch]
Feeling like my belly was a warehouse for the blues[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                    [ch]E[/ch]
And I sure miss my sweet Cocaine Carolina[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
Met her on an ocean liner, called her Cocaine Carolina[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
She was quite a lady then and I was twenty-two[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
God knows how much I adored her, I just could not afford her[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
So goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                                     [ch]E[/ch]
I'm going back to LA getting clean, what I need to do[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]B[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
She don't want me for my money, she just wants my body, honey[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
Oh someone said if I was lucky, I could go to Kentucky[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                                [ch]E[/ch]
Lexington was famous for its strip clubs and its pills[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Carolina, we should get up[/tab]
[tab][ch]E[/ch]
Don't you know we'll have to split up?[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                     [ch]E[/ch]
Maybe I should go back to California[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
So goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                                                  [ch]E[/ch]
I'm going back to LA getting clean, what I need to do[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]         [ch]B[/ch]                     [ch]E[/ch]
She don't want me for my money, she just wants my body, honey[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                               [ch]E[/ch]
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?[/tab]

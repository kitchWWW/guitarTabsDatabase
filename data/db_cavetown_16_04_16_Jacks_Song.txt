[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I remember the view out the back of the car[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
Left the front door wide open[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]
Maybe it's a sign that we shouldn't be going[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D[/ch]
I didn't realise it'd be so hard[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]B[/ch]
You and me, sitting on the trampoline[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Em[/ch]
I think one time we fell asleep[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]D[/ch]
Woke up and felt like it'd been weeks[/tab]

And now it truly has been
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]B[/ch]
(Forgive yourself)[/tab]
It wasn't meant to be but it's funny how
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
Life dealt this cheat[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]D[/ch]
To someone who could handle it so well[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]B[/ch]
 And while you sleep in the pouring rain[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
Just know I'll be with you someday[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
And I'll have a good one 'til then[/tab]

Just like you told me

[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                                    [ch]G[/ch]
I wish we could’ve played that game sometime[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Bm[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
I wish we’d talked more online[/tab]

I’m glad you liked my picture
[tab][ch]D[/ch]
 I stuck it up inside my locker[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]
Becoming disconnected[/tab]

Really puts into perspective
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]
How important every friend is who makes you wanna live[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]D[/ch]
And this time it’s okay to cry[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]
Black sweatpants and pasta with ketchup[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]B[/ch]
When your sister ate the slug it was the grossest thing ever[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]
Collecting beetles in the garden together[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
You're welcome anytime in my dreams[/tab]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]B[/ch]
 Muddy hands and climbing trees[/tab]
[tab]                             [ch]Em[/ch]
Sink-tall while we brush our teeth[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
Striped shirts and hide and seek[/tab]

It's all coming back to me
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]B[/ch]
 While you sleep on a sunny day[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Em[/ch]
Just know I'll remember you always[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]D[/ch]
And no matter how much it hurts[/tab]

It's not goodbye, just see you later

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                                   [ch]B[/ch]
 And while you sleep in the pouring rain[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
Just know I'll be with you someday[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]D[/ch]
And I'll have a good one 'til then[/tab]

Just like you told me

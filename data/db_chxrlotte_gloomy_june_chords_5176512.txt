[Intro]
[ch]C[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
The world outside my room's not a world I can face[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]
'cus I'm out of my head and I have been for days[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
And I can't sleep[/tab]

[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]
I open my eyes it's the evening and then[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
I repeat the same cycle again and again[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
The past is mine to keep[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab]         [ch]F[/ch]                                                      [ch]C[/ch]
I try to make myself think that the good days are worth all the bad[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                                              [ch]C[/ch]
But walking in circles is the future I know I will have[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                                                  [ch]C[/ch]
The days as they're passing are just another burden to me[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]
Just let me be[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
Because I just sit and watch the clock,[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]F[/ch]
I'll say I'm alright when I'm not[/tab]
[tab]                                                         [ch]C[/ch]
and when the sky turns grey I'll hide away alone with my thoughts[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
I'll dream of better days, or run somewhere far away[/tab]
[tab]                                                                  [ch]C[/ch]
It seems my time is up, for now I'll just sleep through another day[/tab]


[Interlude]
[ch]C[/ch]


[Verse 2]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
And I'm sorry I'm not what you want me to be[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]
I'm trapped in my mind and it won't let me free[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
The night it comforts me[/tab]

[tab]      [ch]C[/ch]
I can hear it, the call of that red bathroom floor,[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
Both eyes on the exit, one hand on the door[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
If I go then I'll be free[/tab]


[Pre-Chrous]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                                                 [ch]C[/ch]
The match burns at my fingers, it's time that I just let it go.[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]F[/ch]                                                [ch]C[/ch]
I'll fade softly in darkness, I'll give up and no one will know.[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]F[/ch]                                                  [ch]C[/ch]
The floor's spinning in circles, I can't seem to move from the bed,[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
Or out of my head[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]
Because I just sit and watch the clock,[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]F[/ch]
I'll say I'm alright when I'm not[/tab]
[tab]                                                         [ch]C[/ch]
and when the sky turns grey I'll hide away alone with my thoughts[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
I'll dream of better days, or run somewhere far away[/tab]
[tab]                                                                  [ch]Am[/ch]
It seems my time is up, for now I'll just sleep through another day[/tab]


[Bridge]
[tab]                           [ch]G[/ch]
And I've crossed the line again[/tab]
[tab]                         [ch]F[/ch]
Can't bear to think that this is how it ends[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Fm[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
So close your eyes and just pretend it's all okay.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch] N.C.
Because I just sit and watch the clock,[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]F[/ch]
I'll say I'm alright when I'm not[/tab]
[tab]                                                         [ch]C[/ch]
and when the sky turns grey I'll hide away alone with my thoughts[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]F[/ch]
I'll dream of better days, or run somewhere far away[/tab]
[tab]                                                                  [ch]C[/ch]
It seems my time is up, for now I'll just sleep through another day[/tab]


[Outro]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]
Let me go, let me go[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]
Let me go, let me go, let me go[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]C[/ch] N.C.
Let me go[/tab]

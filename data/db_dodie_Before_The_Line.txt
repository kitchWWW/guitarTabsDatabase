[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]
 I used to smile at every star and thank the sky[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
 Now I look up to all the duds and wonder why[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]D7[/ch]
I feel like  all of them are gone[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
  Can't feel a single one[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
And so I stretch my eyes across the land and sea[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
I know I loved the world, but now it's flat to me[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D7[/ch]
Oh, tell me, did someone snatch the light?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
  Why doesn't it look right?[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Gm[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
 I made a promise, but I break it every day[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Gm[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
 It's not my fault, for I was promised just the same[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                              [ch]A#[/ch]
Once I saw fire, and all I know is something happened[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
Did I let it go?[/tab]

[ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]


[Verse 3]
[tab]                            [ch]F[/ch]
Now every morning since the line between my lives[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]F[/ch]
 I greet the sun and ask, "Have I already died?[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]D7[/ch]
If not, then  why am I alone?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
  And when can I come home?"[/tab]


[Bridge]

Oh, and I am lying when I say
[tab]                            [ch]D[/ch]
It's time to let her float away[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]C#[/ch]
No, I'm still clawing for the strings[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]Fm[/ch]
Oh, I'd do any fucking thing[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]D#[/ch]
I know I have to close the door[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]D[/ch]
Too much to miss it anymore[/tab]

I think that this really is it
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]
  I'll have to take what I can get[/tab]

I'll have to take what I can get

What I can get


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Gm[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
 I made a promise, but I break it every day[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Gm[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
 It's not my fault, for I was promised just the same[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                              [ch]A#[/ch]
Once I saw fire, and all I know is something happened[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
Did I let it go?[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Gm[/ch]             [ch]F[/ch]
 I made a promise, but I break it every day[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]            [ch]Gm[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
 It's not my fault, for I was promised just the same[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                              [ch]A#[/ch]
Once I saw fire, and all I know is something happened[/tab]

Did I let it go?
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                              [ch]A#[/ch]
Once I saw fire, and all I know is something happened[/tab]

Did I let it go?

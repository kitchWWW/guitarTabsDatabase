[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                                [ch]A#m[/ch]
I've seen some souls be friendly, I've seen some feet get loose[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
I've had some people in my life who know just what it do[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                         [ch]A#m[/ch]                    [ch]G#[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
I try to look for goodness even when I see bad[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                                [ch]A#m[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
'98 when I made my first beat tape[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]
I was trippin', I was thinking I could be great[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
Four track Tascam in my brief case[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Back when I would cop my Jordan's straight up outta Eastbay[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
I was just 15 with some big dreams[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]
Big shoes, big heart, no big screen[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
Big talls, big balls, no fig leaves[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Double-X-L well before I spit at 16[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
I was trippin': I was waiting for the right time[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]
I was trippin': I was looking for the right place[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
I was trippin': I was searching for the right words[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Took a wrong turn, now my head is in the right space[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
I was trippin': I was taking all the wrong pills[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]
I was trippin': I was righting all the wrong wrongs[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
I was trippin': I was writing all the right songs[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Looking for a miracle? You're fucking with the right one[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                                [ch]A#m[/ch]
I've seen some souls be friendly, I've seen some feet get loose[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
I've had some people in my life who know just what it do[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                         [ch]A#m[/ch]                    [ch]G#[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
I try to look for goodness even when I see bad[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
I guess it started with a big bang, like a gun shot[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]
When the fall came, and we all stop[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
Never school for the fools when the sun drops[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
We were having mad fun running from the young cops[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
I was on that low brow, thinking too much[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]
Cynicism hit me early like the cold crush[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
Did the knowledge until college then I froze up[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Realize I ain't even working on my post up[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
Had a good shot though, with a big chip[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]
But my shoulders were beholden to that dope shit[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
I was thinking 'bout rhymes, I was dreaming 'bout beats[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I was biding my time, I was sowing these seeds[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
I was - too cold to know that I ain't old enough[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]
Too grown to know that I ain't growing up[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
Two Tones was home so just throw it up[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Black Paisley is back so just pour it up[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                                [ch]A#m[/ch]
I've seen some souls be friendly, I've seen some feet get loose[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]                              [ch]C[/ch]
I've had some people in my life who know just what it do[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                         [ch]A#m[/ch]                    [ch]G#[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
I try to look for goodness even when I see bad[/tab]


[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
I am that Two Tone Rebel, Paisley stain[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]
I got some skin so thick I was made for pain[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
Never change my name, just check my veins[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
All the Wallace brave hearts, I'm the next to reign[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
I'm E-Dubble, powers combine when we troubled[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]
I still lose grip and shit I still fumble[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
Always get it back even when I'm off track[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Cause I'm never off beat and I'm never on whack[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
God damn, how the fuck they let me get in[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]
I just showed up with a couple records looking to spin and[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
Lookin' to win, my cup been filled with a gin[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
I got the juice now too, still sick with a pen[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]
And sick with the keys, and sick with my PC[/tab]
[tab][ch]A#m[/ch]
My beats be off the meat rack fo' sheezy[/tab]
[tab][ch]G#[/ch]
You see he - love the early arts, you can't see me[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]
Two Tone Rebel entrusts you still need me[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                                [ch]A#m[/ch]

I try to look for goodness even when I see bad[/tab]
[tab][ch]Fm[/ch]                                [ch]A#m[/ch]

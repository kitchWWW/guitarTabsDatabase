[Verse 1]

[tab]                  [ch]E[/ch]
yeah i don't wanna[/tab]

wait for you to come around
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
and i don't want to feel[/tab]

like i'm the only one who's making sound
[tab]   [ch]E[/ch]
i try to fall asleep[/tab]

but i can't
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]
because you're inside my head[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab]                        [ch]E[/ch]
i don't want to have to think[/tab]

about you anymore
[tab]              [ch]A[/ch]
and i don't wanna worry[/tab]

about the consequences of getting bored
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
because i am free[/tab]

and i am me
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
and you aren't going to stop me[/tab]

[Chorus]

[tab]    [ch]F#m[/ch]
it should have never happened[/tab]

we were doing so well
[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
i really thought that we could it[/tab]

back from hell
[tab]         [ch]C#m[/ch]
but i should've thought more[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]B[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
about the things you said[/tab]

raising thoughts up from the dead

[Verse 3]
[tab]                        [ch]E[/ch]
and i think it's for the best[/tab]

if we don't see each other
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]
and the only way i'll rest[/tab]

is if i leave you alone
[tab]        [ch]E[/ch]
because i don't feel right[/tab]

i said things i don't mean in a fight
[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
it should've never happened[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]E[/ch]
this shouldn't fucking happen[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]A[/ch]
oooooohh[/tab]

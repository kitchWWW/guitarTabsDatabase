Feel it in my bones, feel it in my bones[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Bm7[/ch]        [ch]Bm7[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]

[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
I'm sick and tired of waiting[/tab]
[tab]                                           [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm sick and tired of waiting by the phone, oh[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]G[/ch]
I know you're home[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Oh my god Becky, look at that butt (Fuck it up)[/tab]

Wrists on ice, with the 40s taped up
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Got a head full of dreams and a heart full of love[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]
But I never made the money so nobody gave a fuck[/tab]

[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Friday night, what you wanna do, solo Halo 2?[/tab]

Sacrifice, no more Xbox Live in the room
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
I'm alright, finish 40s while I'm listening to t.A.T.u[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
"All The Things She Said," and now I'm puking in the bathroom[/tab]
Gone

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Maybe we could take it slow (Slow)[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]Em[/ch]
Ain't nobody gotta know (God knows)[/tab]
[tab]                              [ch]G[/ch]
Put the phone back in the bag, and let me get your mind[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]Am7[/ch]
Let me get your mind[/tab]

Let me get your mind
[tab]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
Let me get your mind on me[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
We're doing fine (Yeah)[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
Oh my god Becky, look at that ass[/tab]

It's that tall motherfucker saying "Don't eat glass"
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]
And you know what they say about a guy with big shoes[/tab]

Insecurities and self-esteem issues
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
But Jakey Christ, baby Jakey, baby brother, Baby J[/tab]

Tell your sister, tell your mother why you're feeling this way
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]
You've been working so hard till it's a.m. in the day[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G[/ch]
Got the 1, 5, 10, 20, fuck it 100K (Hot Boys)[/tab]

[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]
I don't want to take it slow (Slow)[/tab]
[tab]                            [ch]Em[/ch]
Fuck what anybody know (They know)[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]G[/ch]
Put the phone inside the trash, and let me get your mind[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                 [ch]Am7[/ch]
Let me get your mind[/tab]

Let me get your mind
[tab]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
Let me get your mind on me[/tab]

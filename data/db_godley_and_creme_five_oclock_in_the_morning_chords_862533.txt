Verse:

[tab][ch]D#[/ch]                 [ch]G#[/ch]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]F#[/ch]            [ch]D#[/ch]
You're lying in your bed[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]                      [ch]G#[/ch]   
You wonder why it's not morning[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]F#[/ch] 
In your head[/tab]
The day is open for business
But still your eyes are closed
You spread your dreams like butter 
On your toast

Chorus:

[tab][ch]G7[/ch]
Open all the windows[/tab]
And we're rolling up the blinds
[tab][ch]Cadd9[/ch]
All across the world[/tab]
Are people wiping sleep from tired eyes
[tab][ch]G7[/ch]
The faces on the curtains[/tab]
[tab]                                   [ch]D#[/ch]
All the Jekylls and the Hydes are gone[/tab]

Verse:

It's 6 o'clock in the morning
You're only half awake
The other half is shaving 
And the toothpaste like a snake has slithered 
Out the door of the bathroom
And it's hissing in your ear
Get up, get out, 
Get out of here

Chorus2:

[tab][ch]G7[/ch]
The sound of people being people[/tab]
Slowly fills the air
[tab][ch]Csus4[/ch]
And all the crazy things they do[/tab]
To get from here to there
[tab][ch]G7[/ch]
And when the one you're holding[/tab]
Runs her fingers through your hair
[tab]      [ch]E[/ch]
You're on[/tab]

Bridge:

[tab][ch]D#m[/ch]                     
Shifting through the gears[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
It's 8 o'clock in the morning[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]F#m[/ch]
It's been 8 o'clock for years[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]C[/ch]
The factory gates are opening[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
To let the night shift out[/tab]
[tab][ch]C#[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]         [ch]D#[/ch]
And the day shift in[/tab]

Verse:

It's 9 o'clock in the morning
You've been this way before
But something seems to be different
[tab]                                             [ch]D#[/ch]
And you can't quite put your finger on it at all[/tab]

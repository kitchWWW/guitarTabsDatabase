I should have told you all I wanted was to have some fun (to have some fun)[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]                                 [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]Am[/ch]

Now when we're in the movies or the back of a car, You always stop me when I go too far[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]Dm[/ch]                                     [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]

[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]                            [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]Dm[/ch]                                    [ch]Am[/ch]
Does the lull in conversation mean the penny's droppin'? You should have known that I was only window shoppin'[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Dm[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
It's my clumsy way of sayin' that we should be stoppin', Those wedding bells,      Those wedding bells[/tab]

I'm like a square peg in a round hole, I don't be-long here baby[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]F[/ch]   [ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]    [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]Eb[/ch]

[tab][ch]F#[/ch]                                 [ch]D#m[/ch]

Oh I'd do it but the pleasure isn't worth the pain, We'd run out of track before we got on the train[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Dm[/ch]                                          [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]Am[/ch]
Can't you hear the sound of heartstrings snappin' under the strain, Of those wedding bells[/tab]

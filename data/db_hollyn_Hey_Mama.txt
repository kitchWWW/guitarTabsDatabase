Artist: hollyn
Song: Hey Mama
Genre: 
Key: 


Notes: 
A put an A at the beginning of each Verse. That signals to play the intro riff. You play that until it gives
the Dm7 and C#m and then resume it again when it starts with an A. The actual riff, which I will try to add
later is a hammer onto Dm7 picking the D, B, and E string, then picking the high e string on the fifth fret 
followed immediately by a palm mute, then an A chord picking the D, G, and B strings followed by anothe palm 
mute.

[Verse]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
  Got all these emotions, don't know how to feel[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]A[/ch]
 Sometimes it's like I'm living on a ferries wheel[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                             [ch]G[/ch]        
  Torn between the fiction and what is real[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
Oh, Oh[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]
 I hear You whisper to me to give You all control[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
Some days it's harder for me just to let it go[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
 I just need to step out and step into Your flow[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]      [ch]D[/ch]
Oh, Oh[/tab]

[Pre-Chrous]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]              
No matter what the pressure, pressure[/tab]
[tab] [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]A[/ch]
 You will always be the answer, answer[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]                     [ch]Bm[/ch]
Only You know how to steady me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
Ready my heart for everything that's coming my way[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]Bm[/ch]
Help me trust that You're ahead of me[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]   
Going before my feet with every step I take[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]
Only You can calm a storm[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
And only You can restore me when I'm worn[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Bm[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
You steady me, only You can steady me, steady me, me[/tab]
(And that's how it goes with the rest of the song. Same chords,
same timing.)

[Verse 2]
Everybody wants to tell me what I need to do
The only one I need to be listening to is you
So I'ma take your hand and I'ma let you lead me through
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what the pressure, pressure
You will always be the answer, answer

[Chorus]
Only you know how to steady me
Ready my heart for everything that's coming my way
Help me trust that you're ahead of me
Going before my feet with every step I take
Only you can calm a storm
And only you can restore me when I'm worn
You steady me only you can steady me, steady me, me

[Bridge]
My energy gone too
I'm feeling like I'm through
These problems weighing me down
So I'm trusting all in you
I'm serving you until the death of me
Even if my light gets dim I know he's there for me
I just put this in your hands and it's finished, oh
And you never let me down, so I know we winning, oh
And only you can keep me calm
Only you can see me through
Only you can set me free
Cause

[Chorus]
Only you know how to steady me
Ready my heart for everything that's coming my way
Help me trust that you're ahead of me
Going before my feet with every step I take
Only you can calm a storm
And only you can restore me when I'm worn
You steady me, only you can steady me, steady me, me
Only you can steady me, steady me.

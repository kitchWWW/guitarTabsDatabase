[Intro]
[ch]B[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]G#m[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch]  [ch]F#[/ch]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                     [ch]A[/ch]
Think I was a little too nice when we[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]G#m[/ch]
first met[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F#[/ch]    [ch]B[/ch]
You wanted to flirt on the Internet[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]
But I don't think this is Romeo and[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G#m[/ch]
Juliet[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]F#[/ch]
You were a liar, I was an idiot[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                      [ch]D#[/ch]    [ch]G#m[/ch]
And now you say you're "so sorry"[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D#[/ch]
Crawling back to me, begging on your[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]
knees[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D#[/ch]           [ch]G#m[/ch]
But you don't really miss my face[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]B[/ch]
You miss the line on your résumé[/tab]


[Chorus]

So tell me how I'm supposed to take
[tab]        [ch]D#[/ch]
you back[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G#m[/ch]
You wanted to control everything I[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]F#[/ch]
wore, every friend I had[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]B[/ch]                    [ch]D#[/ch]
So I hope you're on a better path[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G#m[/ch]            [ch]E[/ch]
Hope it totally diverges on a graph[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]B[/ch]
For the record's sake I know everything[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]D#[/ch]
you did[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]G#m[/ch]
When you were out at parties, I heard[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]G[/ch]
what your roommates said[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]
Should've never even gone on that first[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]
date[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]G#m[/ch]         [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]
But I was feeling charitable that day[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D#[/ch]             [ch]G#m[/ch]
(I was feeling charitable that day)[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]      [ch]F#[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]
(I was feeling charitable that day)[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]                       [ch]A[/ch]
Used to wonder if you actually believed[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G#m[/ch]
in love[/tab]
[tab]                        [ch]G[/ch]
Cause' I believed your issues were just[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]             [ch]B[/ch]
bits to debug[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]A[/ch]
And your sense of humor's fine, it's just[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G#m[/ch]
a little bit rough[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Have fun with your decision, cause'[/tab]
[tab]     [ch]F#[/ch]
I've had enough[/tab]


[Pre-Chorus]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]                      [ch]D#[/ch]    [ch]G#m[/ch]
And now you say you're "so sorry"[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D#[/ch]
Crawling back to me, begging on your[/tab]
[tab][ch]B[/ch]

[tab]                [ch]D#[/ch]           [ch]G#m[/ch]
But you don't really miss my face[/tab]
[tab]                          [ch]B[/ch]
You miss the line on your résumé[/tab]

[Bridge]

And I don't think you're bad, I don't
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]
think you're fully good[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G#m[/ch]
I don't really think I'm glad that you're[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
so misunderstood[/tab]
[tab] [ch]B[/ch]
And I don't want to write a song to[/tab]
[tab][ch]D#[/ch]
paint you as the villain[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G#m[/ch]
But I hate all of those spaces that you[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]D#[/ch]
used my name to fill in[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]D#[/ch]
And all my friends told me we were[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G#m[/ch]
bound to end[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]
Looks like your résumé is empty now[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]D#[/ch]               [ch]G#m[/ch]
I hate how you pretend[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]Em[/ch]          [ch]B(5)[/ch]
That I meant more to you somehow[/tab]

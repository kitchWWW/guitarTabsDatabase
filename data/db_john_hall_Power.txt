[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]Bm[/ch]
Just give me the warm power of the Sun[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]     
Give me the steady flow of a waterfall[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
Give me the spirit of living things as they return to clay[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]Bm[/ch]
Just give me the restless power of the wind[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Give me the comforting glow of a wood fire[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]
But won't you take all your atomic poison power away[/tab]


[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]                    [ch]Bm[/ch]
Everybody needs some power I'm told[/tab]
[tab]                           [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]
To shield them from the darkness and the cold[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]D[/ch]
Some may seek a way to take control when it's bought and sold[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Bm[/ch]
I know that lives are at stake[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]Em[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
Yours and mine of our descendants in time[/tab]
[tab]                    [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
There's so much to gain and so much to lose[/tab]
[tab]  [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
Everyone of us has to choose[/tab]

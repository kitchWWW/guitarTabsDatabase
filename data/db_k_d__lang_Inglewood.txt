Capo 5 (D, G, Em)
([ch]D[/ch])Inglewood, ([ch]G[/ch])won’t you treat me gentle([ch]D[/ch]) 
I left my heart on the west side 
I’m looking for somewhere I can settle 
Make ([ch]Em[/ch])ready for the ([ch]G[/ch])rest of my ([ch]D[/ch])life

Inglewood, I’ve been feeling so uncertain 
Walk with me in the evening sun 
With every step I’m farther from my burden 
Make ready for the rest of my life


([ch]G[/ch])Take me to a place 
Where music sounds([ch]D[/ch]) good again 
([ch]G[/ch])A place where I could have been 
The place where I ([ch]Em[/ch])should have been 

Inglewood, I don’t mind your rainy weather 
Come inside, and I’ll dry you off 
We’ll light a fire, and we’ll let it burn forever 
Make ready for the rest of my life 
Make ready for the rest of our lives

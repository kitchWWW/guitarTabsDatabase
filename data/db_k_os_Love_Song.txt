Key: 


Great Song and sounds pretty good only acoustic/voice.
Its just the same thing over and over again.  Change strumming at the different parts
and its sounds like sweet nector (I personally like to play it reggae style)

Cm, G#, D#, A# four beats per chord (or whatever time signature it is, either way,
equal time for each chord).

(But let me tell ya)

I could be on the TV
I could be in them magazines
But it's never enough
When you felt the touch
Of an angel that's rocking your soul

[Chorus]
When the rain comes down
You're never around
But when the sun comes up
You always steal the fire
And rain comes down
On this side of town
But people have no feelings
They just run around

[Verse 2]
They just, they just
We keep chasing dollars
It's making me holler
I just don't know
I don't need a check
I need some respect
So people you know
And the war
And the babies crying
And the car
And the house
And the rings
And the things that don't mean nothing
You could try to hate
'Cause if I am right your right down
But I'm here to elevate
I'll be floating in outer space now

[Chorus]
When the rain comes down
Will you be around?
When the sun comes up
Will you always steal my fire?
And rain comes down
On this side of town
But people have no feelings
People

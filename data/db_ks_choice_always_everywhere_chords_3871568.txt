[Verse 1]
[tab]                  [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
You turn off the light, kiss me good night[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]
And mother, I know that I'm going to be alright[/tab]
[tab]               [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
I just can't wait to grow up[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]D[/ch]
Find my own life, be a good wife[/tab]
[tab]                       [ch]C[/ch]
And a smart one, I'm sure[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]D[/ch]
I never took us for granted and I always knew[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]
You and I are special[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
But I never knew how much I'd miss you[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]E5[/ch]                [ch]B[/ch]
So much has changed and been rearranged[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]
And I see that I've lost[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]
What made me so young and incredibly strong[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]
And never ever wrong[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]
You were always there[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]
'Cause you're always everywhere[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]
I used to cry for no reason[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
And that's still the same[/tab]
[tab]   [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Except that I had adolescence to blame[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]C[/ch]
But not now[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]G[/ch]                               [ch]D[/ch]
Now I feel sad because I don't know what's true[/tab]
[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]
And I miss thinking I could be just like you.[/tab]


[Chorus]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]
So much has changed and been rearranged[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]
And I see that I've lost[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]
What made me so young and incredibly strong[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]
And never ever wrong[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]B[/ch]
So much has changed and been rearranged[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]A[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]
And I see that I've lost[/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]B[/ch]
What made me so sure that I could endure[/tab]
[tab]                   [ch]A[/ch]
How hard it is to live and lose and live again[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]B[/ch]
And never understand[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]
You are always everywhere[/tab]
[tab] [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]B[/ch]
You are always everywhere[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]      [ch]B[/ch]
You're always there[/tab]
[tab]                [ch]A[/ch]
You're always there[/tab]

You're always everywhere[/tab]

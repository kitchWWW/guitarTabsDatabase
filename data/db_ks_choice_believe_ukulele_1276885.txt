Bravely I look further than I see 
Knowing things I know I cannot be, not now
I'm so aware of where I am, but I don't know where that is, and there's
Something right in front of me and I

Touch the fingers of my hand, and I wonder if it's me[/tab]
[tab]                     [ch]Bb[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]                        [ch]Am[/ch]
Holding on and on to theories of prosperity, someone who can promise me[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
I believe in me[/tab]

Tomorrow I was nothing, yesterday I'll be
Time has fooled me into thinking it's a part of me
Nothing in this room but empty space
No me, no world, no mind, no face

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
Touch the fingers of my hand and tell me if it's me[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]Am[/ch]
Holding on and on to love, what else is real, a religion that appeals to me, oh[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
I believe in me[/tab]

[tab][ch]F[/ch]        [ch]Bb[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]
Can you turn me off for just a second, please[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Gm[/ch]              [ch]Bb[/ch]
Turn me into something faceless, weightless, mindless, homeless, vacuum state of peace[/tab]

On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on, I believe in me (Play twice)
Wait for me, I'm nothing on my own
I'm willing to go on, but not alone, not now
I'm so aware of everything, but nothing seems for real and
As long as you're in front of me then I'll

[tab][ch]Bb[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]                                [ch]Am[/ch]
I Watch the fingers of our hands, and I'm grateful that it's me[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]Bb[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]Am[/ch]
Holding on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
I believe in me[/tab]

I'm willing to go on, but not alone, not now...
I'm so aware of everything...

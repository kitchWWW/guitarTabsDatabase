Intro
[ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]Asus[/ch] [ch]E5[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Asus[/ch] x2

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch] 				  [ch]Asus[/ch]
Welcome the rainbow, fading to gray[/tab]
[tab][ch]E5[/ch]				[ch]G[/ch]           [ch]Asus[/ch]&#8232;
Spinning around us, making (me say) mistakes[/tab]
&#8232;I'm looking for something like most of us do
&#8232;I'm looking at god but he's looking at you&#8232;
He looks for a driver to take him back home&#8232;
To get it together by being alone
&#8232;I'm sure he's a writer, he wrote me just now
&#8232;The letter is empty like I'm living now&#8232;&#8232;

[tab]      [ch]Bm[/ch]  [ch]A[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]  [ch]F#[/ch]
&#8232;But that feels good to do[/tab]

Compared to losing you&#8232;&#8232;[/tab]

(Chords as first verse)&#8232;

Do I need a baby to smother the pain&#8232;
To stop all (I) live through from being in vain&#8232;
Vanity fills me, vanity's nice&#8232;
But somehow it kills you by hitting you twice
&#8232;So take it all brother, take it from me&#8232;
All but my lover 'cause she is in me
&#8232;So many lovers don't look but they find&#8232;
We're lovers too but I'm losing my mind&#8232;

&#8232;Compared to losing you&#8232;[/tab]

[tab][ch]D[/ch]  
&#8232;Can I be a memory[/tab]
[tab][ch]DM7[/ch]				[ch]Bm[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]&#8232;
Can I be a part of your ways[/tab]
[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]            &#8232;
Can I be the moonlight[/tab]
[tab][ch]DM7[/ch]        					[ch]E[/ch]&#8232;
That shines on your beautiful face[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]&#8232;
You can make me glow[/tab]
[tab][ch]F#[/ch]&#8232;
I don't think you know...&#8232;&#8232;[/tab]
(SOLO)
[ch]Bm[/ch]  [ch]Asus[/ch] [ch]E5[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Asus[/ch]

&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;| I keep on singing a song is a dove&#8232;| It lives in a desert to celebrate love&#8232;

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]  [ch]Asus[/ch] [ch]E5[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch] [ch]Asus[/ch]&#8232;
May be tomorrow, may be tonight&#8232;[/tab]
You will look up and you'll know I'm all right
&#8232;But me I'll be searching&#8232;Looking for truth
&#8232;Finding a gimpse in a picture of you
&#8232;I will be ready, ready to ride
&#8232;Ready to roam as I'm burning inside&#8232;

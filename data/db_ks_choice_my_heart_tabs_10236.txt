Not so long ago
We both felt love became a word
No more than that
With sex that felt like wings without a bird

The only thing that we both love
Is in the cradle that we rock
Six hands, six feet, but just one beat
The ticking of the clock

Chorus:

I always heard I could get hurt
I knew that from the start
Break my face, my back, my arms, my neck
But please don¹t break my heart

Solid wood will rot
If you don¹t keep it from the rain
We were suprised when we found out
That love feels just like pain

Chorus x 2

[Intro]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]Am[/ch]
In time, I'll be hanging on your nightstand by myself[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]    [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]F[/ch]          [ch]Am[/ch]
As I sit in the dust while you lay with someone else[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
And I wish that you could feel how it felt[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]C[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
Knowing I am just an ornament on your shelf[/tab]


[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Honestly, you never needed this[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]
I know you've got more that you're dealing with[/tab]

I'm just a burden, I know that
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
I just wish that I could go back[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]C[/ch]
Funny how everything changes[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Old feelings, new faces[/tab]

They say home is where you make it

Resided in you, now it's vacant


[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
'Cause every single day I wanna blame myself[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]
I'm with you when you sleep but you're with someone else[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]
And every single day you see my colors fade[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
I'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
And I can feel the pain when you see my face[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
And you can close the drawer but that won't change a thing[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]
Every single day you see my colors fade[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                                                 [ch]Am[/ch]
I'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away[/tab]


[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]
Now I gotta keep it all in like it's all good[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]                                          [ch]Am[/ch]
But everything changed when you left me in Oakwood[/tab]
[tab]                                [ch]C[/ch]
And if you could take it back I know you would[/tab]
[tab][ch]F[/ch]
Won't throw me away when you know you should[/tab]
[tab][ch]Am[/ch]
Tell me what's real, is it all in my head?[/tab]
[tab]                               [ch]C[/ch]
Every night, every word that I said[/tab]
[tab]                                     [ch]F[/ch]
They say move on, but I'm better off dead[/tab]
[tab]                                      [ch]F[/ch]
How can I sleep when I'm next to your bed?[/tab]

How can you keep me confined in a frame?

Memories fading, the faces will change
[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]                               [ch]F[/ch]
But I still live in your head, so I stay[/tab]

Next to your bed, watch me wither away


[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
'Cause every single day I wanna blame myself[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]
I'm with you when you sleep but you're with someone else[/tab]
[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]
And every single day you see my colors fade[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]F[/ch]
I'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]G[/ch]
And I can feel the pain when you see my face[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]
And you can close the drawer but that won't change a thing[/tab]
[tab] [ch]Am[/ch]
Every single day you see my colors fade[/tab]
[tab] [ch]F[/ch]                                                 [ch]Am[/ch]
I'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away[/tab]

In time, I'll be hanging on your nightstand by myself[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]F[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]Am[/ch]
And I gather dust alone on your shelf[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab] [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]Am[/ch]
'Cause every single day I wanna blame myself[/tab]
[tab]                      [ch]F[/ch]

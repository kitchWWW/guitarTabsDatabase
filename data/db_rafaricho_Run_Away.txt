[Intro]
[ch]Em[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
I saw you out my window, skating on the street[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                               [ch]C[/ch]
I wanted to say something but I was glued to my seat[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]
I was thinking about you, whilst staring at my ceiling[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                             [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
The way that you looked at me gave me a strange feeling[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe we should run away, hide until the day ends[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Could we face another day[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
or maybe we should run away[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
maybe we should run away[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
maybe we should run away[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
maybe we should run away...[/tab]

[Verse 2]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]*                       [ch]G[/ch]
Running through the city, hiding from the cops[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                [ch]C[/ch]
I don't know what hit me but for once I don't feel lost[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
I don't know what we're looking for[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Are you mine or am I yours[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
Maybe we should run away, hide until the day ends[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
Could we face another day[/tab]
[tab][ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch]
or maybe we should run away[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
maybe we should run away[/tab]
[tab][ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
maybe we should run away[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
maybe we should run away...[/tab]

[Verse 3]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]*                          [ch]G[/ch]
Smashing through the windows breaking our way in[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                                  [ch]C[/ch]
Hiding from the streetlights, let the story begin[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]
I don't know what we're looking for[/tab]
[tab][ch]D[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]
Are you mine or am I yours[/tab]

[tab]            [ch]Em[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
With the lights of the car pointing into the dark[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]
And the station was close but why did it feel so far?[/tab]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
And you held my hand but it only made me sad[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
When you said don't look back, what did you mean by that?[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
Oooh[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
Is it too late?[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
Oooh[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
Is it too late?[/tab]

[Verse]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]C[/ch]
As we stood in the cold, your head against my chest[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
And the snow in your hair melted beneath my breath[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
And I tried to tell you but I was too afraid[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]
Baby please won't you stay, that's what I meant to say[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
Oooh[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
Is it too late?[/tab]
[tab] [ch]D[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch]
Oooh[/tab]
[tab]           [ch]C[/ch]
Is it too late?[/tab]

[Verse 1]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
I feel like I lost a part of me[/tab]
[tab]              [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]
Like you took a piece of my personality[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]
I want myself back but shes so gone[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]G[/ch]                        [ch]D[/ch]
you took the girl I used to be and ruined her all[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
How many times did I apologize how many times did I say I cant read your mind?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]D[/ch]
My heart was broken as I sat and cried listening to all the things I could never sacrifice.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Im on a carysel ride with you endlessly[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]

[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]                           [ch]G[/ch]                      [ch]D[/ch]
I changed myself into someone I dont know someone I dont wanna be just to say you were with me[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                                   [ch]C[/ch]                         [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
even when you were seeing him it was still me and you you said I was all yours but did you tell him that too?[/tab]
[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                    [ch]C[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]
I was your jester and he was your knight im your entertainment, but hes your rite.[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]        [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]

We go round and round up and down you drag me endlessly[/tab]

[Bridge]
[tab]  [ch]Em[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]
I drowned in your gasoline as you threw out your lighter[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
the carysel burned in a raging fire[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                   [ch]C[/ch]
the metal rusted and the horses died[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]G[/ch]                              [ch]D[/ch]
the only thing left was the broken lullaby[/tab]
[tab]         [ch]Em[/ch]                        [ch]C[/ch]
a horror movie score rather than a childs lore[/tab]
[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
I dont know how to trust anymore[/tab]

[Chorus]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Im on a carysel ride with you endlessly[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
We go round and round up and down you drag me endlessly[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]
Im on a carysel ride with you endlessly[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]Em[/ch]                          [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]
